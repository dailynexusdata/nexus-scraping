data,Looking Back: The Thomas Fire's Impact on Santa Barbara Air Quality,22-Jan-18,12:41 PM,['Hayley Tice'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-22/looking-back-the-thomas-fires-impact-on-santa-barbara-air-quality/,"As UC Santa Barbara students began preparing for finals last December, the Thomas Fire ignited in Ventura County, spreading to Santa Barbara County and the Los Padres National Forest within days. While UCSB and Isla Vista did not receive evacuation orders, several locations on campus and in I.V. closed, Chancellor Henry T. Yang cancelled the last two classes of Fall Quarter, and the university postponed finals due to frequent power outages and poor air quality. Here's a breakdown of how rapidly smoke and ash from the Thomas Fire ""î the largest wildfire in modern California's recorded history ""î impacted Santa Barbara County's air quality. Graph A  Graph A was compiled using data from the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (APCD). The graph depicts the daily measurements for particulate matter (PM) 2.5 readings at the APCD's Goleta monitoring station from the month of December in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Data is given in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m≥). Particulate matter, also called particle pollution, is ""the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air,""ù according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and can vary greatly in shape, size and chemical composition. There are two different types of particulate matter: PM 10 and PM 2.5, which are determined based on their size. ""The invisible fine particles (known as PM 2.5) in wildfire smoke can lodge deep into the lungs and cause serious health effects,""ù said Lyz Hoffman, the public information officer for the APCD, in an email. Hoffman said that the larger, visible particles are less of a threat to our heart and lungs than PM 2.5. She noted that particulate matter can ""cause serious health effects,""ù including aggravated asthma, nose and throat irritation, bronchitis and lung damage. ""These fine particles may even get into your bloodstream and affect your heart,""ù she added in the email, encouraging people with continued symptoms from smoke exposure to talk to their doctors. Image courtesy of the EPA Hoffman said data was not collected on Dec. 1 through 3 because the PM 2.5 monitor required a maintenance test during that time. There was a large spike in the daily averages after Dec. 4, the day the Thomas Fire began. These averages reached their peak on Dec. 7 at 130 µg/m≥. This is over 14 times greater than the value observed on Dec. 7, 2016. The averages returned to levels similar to previous years on Dec. 20, when the fire's containment reached 60 percent. The highest hourly reading of PM 2.5, 228 µg/m≥, was observed on Dec. 7 at 1 a.m. The hourly readings, however, can fluctuate, which Hoffman said is because air consists of different particles, and particulate matter concentrations change as the air moves. Here's what these measures look like on the Air Quality Index (AQI), a measure of air quality the EPA uses to show air pollution in an area and inform viewers of the health concerns associated with the readings. Graph B  Graph B depicts AQI data collected from the EPA's AIRNow website from Dec. 4 to Dec. 31, not including Dec. 12. Hoffman said that gaps can occur in the hourly readings for reasons including maintenance, internet connection and power outages. According to the EPA, the AQI of particulate matter is measured on a scale from 0 to 500. The EPA sets the national air quality standard as 100; AQI readings below 100 are seen as satisfactory, while higher values correspond to greater levels of air pollution and health concerns. When the readings exceed 35 µg/m≥, they correlate to a value over 100 on the AQI, which poses greater health risks. Hoffman said the particulate matter in Goleta on Dec. 7 was the station's largest measurement since it started sampling for them in 2010. Air quality in Goleta on Dec. 7 registered as a 193 on the AQI (Graph B), a reading the EPA classifies as ""unhealthy.""ù
According to the EPA, people ""may begin to experience some adverse health effects, and members of the sensitive groups may experience more serious effects""ù with such high readings. Table A breaks down the different levels of AQI and explains what that means for residents in the area. Table A  Data from the EPA shows that eight days of Dec. 2017 in Goleta had ""unhealthy""ù levels of PM 2.5, five days had ""moderate""ù levels and 12 days had ""good""ù levels. Four days did not have a value, as shown on Graph B. Hourly readings, however, extended into ""hazardous""ù territory, according to data from the ACPD. The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and the APCD issued an Air Quality Warning on Dec. 5, which they lowered to an Air Quality Watch on Dec. 22 and then cancelled on Dec. 29, when the fire was at 92 percent containment. The impacts from the Thomas Fire ""î as well as the fatal mudslides in Montecito that closed Highway 101 and killed over 20 people ""î continue to affect the community. Since the peak of the fire, however, air quality in Goleta has returned to ""good-to-moderate""ù levels, according to the ACPD. Community members can continue checking air quality measures in Goleta on the EPA website and the Santa Barbara ACPD website.

data,UCSB Student Loans at a Glance,17-Mar-18,11:54 AM,['Hayley Tice'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-17/ucsb-student-loans-at-a-glance/,"UC Santa Barbara students and their parents borrowed a total of $91,162,535 in student loans during the 2016-17 school year, according to the current Campus Profile.  The number of students taking out federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans has risen since 2006, with community members attributing this increase to the rising cost of tuition.† Will Tran / Daily Nexus The number of students taking out federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans has risen since 2006, with community members attributing this increase to the rising cost of tuition. The University of California Regents voted Thursday afternoon to increase the supplemental fee levied on out-of-state students by 3.5 percent ""î $978 ""î to raise it to $28,992. During the 2016-17 school year, students took out $33,851,988 in subsidized direct loans and $18,838,521 in unsubsidized direct loans, both of which come from the federal government. The government pays the interest on subsidized student loans while students are in college or the loan is in deferral. Students are eligible for deferral under certain conditions, such as if the student is unemployed or in graduate school, and do not have to make payments (though interest will accrue on unsubsidized loans). President Donald Trump recently proposed eliminating subsidized student loans in his 2019 budget proposal. During the 2016-17 school year, students received an average amount of $4,227.80 in subsidized direct loans and $3,069.66 in unsubsidized direct loans. †Both loans carry a maximum interest rate of 4.45 percent annually, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Other loan sources include federal Perkins loans, which are issued by UCSB, federal parent P.L.U.S. loans and private agency loans. Students borrowed an average of $2,185.01 in Perkins loans and $13,839.81 in loans from private agencies while parents took out an average of $14,809 in parent P.L.U.S. loans during the 2016-2017 school year. Graph A shows the total loans issued to UCSB students each academic year from 2007-08 to 2016-17. This data was compiled from the UCSB Office of Accountability and Planning's campus profiles. Graph A  The campus profiles did not include numbers for loans from the Santa Barbara Foundation in 2013 and 2015. Michael Miller, the Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Enrollment at UCSB, said in an email that the program was eliminated. The amount of money distributed for subsidized and unsubsidized loans increased dramatically between the academic years of 2005-06 and 2010-11. This climb follows an increase in the number of students taking out loans as shown in Graph B. †The number of students taking out unsubsidized direct loans increased by 166 percent, while the number of students taking out subsidized loans increased by about 32 percent. Graph B  Miller said in an email that this was ""a direct reflection of the increasing costs of higher education.""ù Tuition over this period increased from $6,993 for California residents to $9,402, an increase of about 34 percent. It is currently about $12,630 for residents, with an additional $28,014 for non-California residents. In January, The Regents of the University of California decided to postpone a vote on raising the base tuition both in-state and out-of-state students pay to May. The proposal would increase tuition by $342 to $12,972. The UCSB Associated Students Senate recently passed a resolution opposing the proposed tuition increase and encouraging the California state government to contribute more money to the University of California. The resolution says that the rising cost of college is ""forcing 55 percent of UC students to take on thousands of dollars in loans.""ù ""There is simply not adequate funding to provide for necessary student services like sufficient classroom space, mental health resources, or enough faculty,""ù A.S. Senator Brooke Kopel, one of the resolution's authors, said in an email. The number of Perkins loans accepted decreased in the 2016-17 academic year, however, by about 44 percent, from $2,500 to 915, although the numbers have rebounded since then to $1,136 during this period. Miller said this was due to the federal government phasing out the Perkins loan. ""The Department of Education restricted who could accept new loans,""ù he said, regarding the drop between school years 2005-06 and 2010-11. He added that Perkins loans will not be available for the 2018-19 academic year. During the 2016-17 school year, 1,136 UCSB students received Perkins loans. Like the total numbers shown in Graph A, the campus profiles did not include numbers for students taking out loans from the Santa Barbara Foundation in 2013 and 2015. The average amount of student loans UCSB students have received each year has stayed roughly the same, as shown in Graph C, aside from fluctuations in private loans and an approximately 23 percent increase in average parent loans. Graph C  The campus profiles did not include data from the Santa Barbara Foundation concerning the average amount students took out in loans from the Santa Barbara Foundation from 2013-2016. Seventy percent of UCSB undergraduates and 97 percent of graduate students received financial aid in the 2016-17 school year. Of the students who received need-based financial aid, 79.3 percent of their determined need was met by that financial aid, according to the common data set. According to a report released in January from the Department of Education, 38.5 percent of students nationally in the 2015-16 academic year took out student loans. The number increased to 53.8 percent of borrowing students who attend four-year public doctorate-granting institutions like UCSB. About 53.4 percent of UCSB undergraduate students took out loans in the 2016-17 school year, according to UCSB's common data set. A January statement from UC Board of Regents Chair George Kieffer and UC President Janet Napolitano called for increased funding from the state government. ""The governor's budget plan does not include funding for UC enrollment growth,""ù the statement said, adding that UC is committed to adding 2,000 new undergraduates in 2018 and has requested funding for 500 more graduate students as well. Kopel attributed increases in students receiving loans at UCSB to rises in tuition. ""The underlying problem here is that since 2006, UC tuition has increased exponentially,""ù she said in an email. ""The UC Regents continue to pass tuition hikes partially because the state legislature consistently pursues a policy of disinvestment in UC education.""ù If you're interested in viewing the data we used in this story, you can download an Excel file of the total amounts of loans students borrowed, the number of students who took out loans each year, and the average amounts of each type of loan here.

The Nexus's origins date back to the year 1923, sharing student stories under the name of The Eagle. Since then, the newspaper has adopted five different names before settling on the Daily Nexus in 1971. Much like its name, the Nexus has changed significantly over the years: Graduations, national crises and university upheavals have all altered the face of the newspaper, as well as the content we produce. Today, more than ever, the Nexus staff is aware of the impact it has on UC Santa Barbara students through its stories. We understand how important diversity is in a college newsroom, and we want to be as transparent as possible about who we are as reporters and students. Last quarter, the Nexus conducted an internal survey about the demographics of our editorial staff. The questions were anonymous and optional, and 28 editors completed the survey out of the Nexus's 39-member staff. The newspaper is currently in the process of transitioning in new editors for the next academic year. Some of our outgoing editors are still part of the staff, so we chose to leave in their responses. As student journalists, we strive to be better storytellers and listeners each day because we are accountable to you, our peers. Through this survey, we hope to shed light on who we are and how we can become more inclusive in our staff and our content with each passing year.

Although data on students graduating this year is not available yet, numbers from UCSB's Office of Budget and Planning show some of the most popular majors through the years. During the 2016-17 school year, across 95 majors, 5328 UC Santa Barbara undergraduates received 5986 degrees. The most popular major for students that year was a Bachelor of Arts in psychology, with 8.8 percent of graduating seniors graduating with the degree. Diane Mackie, the chair of the psychology department at UCSB, said this is because psychological and brain sciences is a ""fascinating discipline.""ù ""[We] have great teaching and mentoring faculty, we encourage research involvement, our focus is on understanding behavior, and lots of graduate schools and employers like our graduates,""ù she said in an email. UCSB accepted its last group of students for the B.A. in psychology ""ì""ì transfer students of the class of 2019 ""î last fall because UCSB discontinued the B.A. Mackie said admissions data suggests the new psychological and brain sciences major may be more popular than the B.A. in psychology. ""Understanding behavior requires an appreciation of its biological underpinnings, and incorporating that more formally into the degree only makes the degree more appealing and useful,""ù she said in the email. Other popular majors included communication with 6.7 percent, sociology with 8 percent, economics and accounting with 6 percent and global studies with 5.7 percent. Biological sciences, 4.2 percent, and biopsychology, 3 percent, were the most popular Bachelors of Science degrees awarded. Hover over the chart below to learn more about popular majors. †  † In 2015-16, the most recent available data, 6.84 percent of bachelor's degrees earned by students in the United States were in psychology, according to the U.S. Department of Education. The most popular field nationally was business as 21.66 percent of graduating seniors across the U.S. received degrees in the field, according to the data. UCSB does not have a business degree, but 11 percent of degrees conferred were in economics-related fields, including business economics, economics, economics-accounting, economics-mathematics and financial mathematics & statistics. The number of B.A.s awarded outnumbered the number of B.S.s awarded by about 150 percent in 2016-17, according to the data.  Students received 4166 B.A. degrees and 1618 B.S. degrees during the 2016-17 school year. UCSB awarded seven Bachelor of Music degrees and 18 Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees. The number of B.S. degrees has increased significantly since 1980-81, when the data set starts. Only 288 B.S. degrees were awarded in 1980-81, while 1618 B.S. degrees were awarded in the 2016-17 school year. † You can download the data about the most popular majors at UCSB here. † [Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the number of B.S. degrees awarded in 2016-17 was 2765; 1618 degrees were awarded B.S. degrees were awarded that year.]

UCSB admitted 29,782 students out of 92,017 freshmen applicants, both of which are record-high numbers compared to previous years. The new admissions numbers represent an increase of 2,903 admitted freshmen students compared to those admitted for the 2017-18 school year.  Out-of-state and international students make up approximately 60 percent of the increase in admitted freshman. UCSB accepted 991 more international students and 735 more out-of-state students for the freshman class than it did the previous year. Non-resident students typically accept UC admission offers at a ""much lower rate""ù than resident students, according to a press release from UC Office of the President (UCOP).

Median gross pay for non-student employees was approximately $51,500. Median pay for graduate and undergraduate student employees was $2,870.  Approximately 3.9 percent of all non-student UCSB employees, or 259 non-students, received more than $200,000 that year. An additional 14.4 percent, or 968 non-students, received between $100,000 and $199,999. Salaries for tenured and tenure-track employees across the UC system are below market by approximately 12 percent, according to a 2014 report from University of California Office of the President (UCOP). Approximately 66.7 percent of undergraduate and graduate student employees at UCSB earned less than $5000, and approximately 79.9 percent earned less than $10,000, according to the data. Professor Finn Kydland of the Economics Department received the highest gross pay of UCSB employees in 2017. His pay totalled $494,766. Kydland received the 2004 Nobel Prize in Economics. Fellow Nobel Prize laureate and materials professor Shuji Nakamura received the second-highest gross pay of UCSB employees: $477,125. Nakamura received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2014 for the invention of the blue light-emitting diode and recently was awarded the 2018 Zayed Future Energy Prize.  Chancellor Henry Yang received the highest regular pay and ninth-highest total pay of UCSB employees. He received $414,949. The top-paid employees in the UC system, however, work elsewhere. Kydland was the 750th most-paid employee across the University of California, according to the data. Across the UC system, two intercollegiate athletic coaches from UC Los Angeles, James Lawrence Mora and Stephen Todd Alford, were the first and second-most paid employees. Mora received approximately $3.7 million in 2017, and Alford received approximately $2.7 million that year.  Daniel Dykes, a former head coach at UC Berkeley, received approximately $1.9 million in 2017 and was the eighth most-paid employee that year. The remainder of the top 10 most-paid employees in the UC system were faculty in the health sciences. Most of the highest paid employee's pay was classified as ""other pay,""ù as shown in the graphs. This category includes compensation for teaching summer session or university extension courses, negotiated extra pay for clinical care and research in Health Sciences schools, performance-based incentive compensation, compensation for summer research and other categories, according to UCOP.

These statistics, from the UC Santa Barbara's 2018 Annual Security Report, include crimes committed on the UCSB campus, public property adjacent to the campus and other campus affiliated properties. The report includes crimes reported to UC Police Department and other campus security agencies, including the UCSB Clery Act Compliance Coordinator, the Office of Judicial Affairs, the Residential Student Conduct, the Title IX & Sexual Harassment Compliance Office and Employee Labor Relations ""ì Human Resources. The UCSB Police Department is required to publish these statistics to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), according to the report. Most crimes are reported to UCPD, while a ""small number""ù of reports are sent to the Clery Coordinator to be included in crime statistics, said Lieutenant Robert Romero, UCSB Police Department spokesperson, in an email. A total of 32 rapes were reported in 2017, compared to 27 in 2016 and 17 in 2015. Reports of domestic violence increased from 6 in 2015 and 2016 to 25 in 2017. Reports of dating violence increased steadily within the past two years, from 6 in 2015, to 11 in 2016 and 13 in 2017. The increase could reflect an increase in the number of victims and survivors reporting crimes, according to Briana Conway, the director of the Campus Advocacy, Resources & Education (C.A.R.E.) at UCSB. ""When survivors feel supported by advocates and law enforcement, and when they are able to make informed decisions regarding their rights and options, they are more likely to engage in formal reporting systems,""ù she said in an email. Emily Montalvo-Telford, a fourth-year philosophy and sociology double major and the director of Students Against Sexual Assault, a committee of the UCSB Human Rights Board, said that while ""any amount of increase is very important to recognize,""ù these numbers ""nowhere represent the actual numbers of assaults that happen in Isla Vista and on the UCSB campus.""ù Most on-campus crimes that were reported occurred in student housing facilities.  In 2017, 19 of the 24 reported rapes and 10 of the 12 reported instances of dating violence on campus took place in student housing. Most of the stalking, burglary, domestic violence, aggravated assault and fondling crimes reported on-campus also occurred in student housing. Two hate crimes were reported in 2017, an ""intimidation incident""ù and an aggravated assault. Both crimes were characterized by national origin bias and occurred on public property, according to the report. Zero hate crimes were reported in 2016 and 2015. The report also showed a decrease in liquor and drug law violations referred for disciplinary action. 417 people were referred for disciplinary action due to liquor law violations in 2016 while 370 people were referred in 2017.  Drug law violations referred for disciplinary action have decreased from 210 in 2015 to 120 and 118 in 2016 and 2017, respectively. ""Continual education and outreach may be the contributing factor""ù for these decreases, according to Romero.  Updated [Oct. 5]: This article was updated to include further information about SASA.

data,SBMTD Moves Busses to Increase Capacity on Line 28,1-Nov-18,12:41 PM,['Shan He'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/sbmtd-moves-busses-to-increase-capacity-on-line-28/,"The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transportation District moved its 60-foot long articulated buses to Line 28 on Oct. 15, according to district spokeswoman Hillary Blackerby. An articulated bus is one that can carry two passenger compartments instead of one, allowing more passengers on board. The new 60-foot long articulated buses can accommodate approximately 113 people when passengers are standing, Blackerby said. The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transportation District's (SBMTD) 60-foot long buses as well as 40-foot buses will service Line 28 while UC Santa Barbara is in session, according to Blackerby. Generally, the 40-foot long buses serve Lines 11 and 24x, while 30 and 40-foot long buses serve Line 27. Only two of SBMTD's 60-foot buses are in service at any one time. A 30-foot long bus can hold approximately 57 people with a standing load, while a 40-foot long bus can hold about 81. Most of Line 28's ridership is UCSB students, according to data from UCSB. UCSB students comprised approximately 92 percent of riders on Line 28 in May 2017, according to the UCSB Transportation and Parking Services website. UCSB students also make up significant portions of ridership on several other lines, particularly during the academic year. Approximately 88 percent of Line 27's riders in 2017 were UCSB students; about 52 percent of riders on Line 24x and 29 percent of Line 11's riders were also UCSB students that year.  Line 28 is the only line fully funded by UCSB, according to Blackerby. It started service in August 2016 in preparation for the opening of the San Joaquin Apartments in August 2017. Line 28 accommodated a large number of passengers before San Joaquin opened, she said. However, demand is still outpacing the Line 28 buses' capacity. ""UCSB is aware of the issue, and we look forward to continuing the conversation on how to accommodate UCSB's growing population,""ù Blackerby said in an email. When there are more passengers than there is room on the buses, the drivers must refuse to let further individuals on board. Approximately 2,300 ""too full to board""ù loads occurred on Lines 11, 24x, 27 and 28 in 2017, while about 3,400 occurred on all SBMTD buses that year.  These lines, however, had a higher portion of ""too full to board loads""ù than other busses on the SBMTD system in 2017, according to data from the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit Agency. Line 28 had an especially disproportionate number of ""too full to board""ù loads. While it handled approximately seven percent of overall ridership across SBMTD busses in 2017, its busses had approximately 26 percent of the system's ""too full to board loads.""ù  Lines 27 and 24x also had high proportions of the system's ""too full to board loads""ù compared to ridership. Line 27 accommodated approximately five percent of the system's ridership and 11 percent of the system's ""too full to board loads,""ù while Line 28 had approximately nine percent of the system's ridership and 15 percent of ""too full to board""ù loads.

data,Food Insecurity: A Look at the Numbers,20-Jan-19,10:22 PM,['Michelle Wong'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-20/food-insecurity-a-look-at-the-numbers/,"Over 3,000 UC Santa Barbara students visited the Associated Students Food Bank in the 2017-2018 school year, making up approximately 13 percent of the student body, according to the A.S. Food Bank's annual report. The Food Bank recently expanded its service hours for students last October, adding Friday to their regular Monday, Wednesday and Thursday schedule. Food Bank use has ""been increasing steadily""ù for about 18 months, according to Rodolfo Herrera, A.S. Food Bank's Food Bank coordinator. ""We used to see 400 students a day, and now we're seeing about 600,""ù Herrera said. However, a 2016 study conducted on UC students by the UC Global Food initiative suggests that more UCSB students have food insecurity than are using the food bank. Approximately 19 percent of University of California students suffered from very low food security, and about 23 percent suffered from low food security, according to the study.  According to a separate 2017 study from the Global Food Initiative, food insecurity was more prevalent among underrepresented minority students. Approximately 62 percent of African-American and 57 percent of Hispanic students reported experiencing food insecurity, while 35 percent of white students and 41 percent of Asian-American students reported it.  LGBTQ students and first-generation students also reported higher rates of food insecurity than non-LGBTQ and non-first-generation students. Students experiencing food insecurity were 11 percent more likely to purchase food from fast food restaurants, according to the 2016 study. Food insecurity also can negatively impact diet quality through inadequate amounts of vitamins and minerals, leading to potential health issues. These students also reported lower GPA averages (3.1) compared to students who are confident in their food security (3.4). Food insecure students were also seven percent more likely to suspend studies due to financial hardship. Over half of food-insecure UC students were new to food insecurity, according to the study. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines several levels of food security. Individuals with high food security do not have food-access limitations or problems. Food security includes those experiencing both high and marginal food security. People with marginal food security have issues accessing adequate food, but the quality, variety and quantity of their food intake is not considerably reduced, according to the USDA. Low food security symptoms, however, include reduced quality, variety and desirability of diets without significant changes in quantity. Very low security qualifies as disrupted eating patterns and lowered food intake due to a lack of money and resources. UC students also reported higher rates of food insecurity than United States residents as a whole. Undergraduates were more likely to have low or very low food security than graduate students. Approximately 48 percent of undergraduates had low or very low food security compared to 25 percent of graduate students. Approximately 12 percent of U.S.households were food insecure in 2017, according to a USDA survey. Less than five percent of U.S. residents had very low food security that year. Other universities had significant rates of food insecurity among students as well. A 2016 survey at West Virginia University found that approximately 30 percent of students at the university were food insecure. At a mid-sized rural university in Oregon, 59 percent of students were food insecure at some point between May 2010 and 2011, according to a 2014 study. Students, however, are not the only people on campus affected by food insecurity. A 2016 study from Occidental College found that 45 percent of clerical, administrative and support staff across the University of California suffer from very low food security and an additional 25 percent have low food security.

It is unclear whether two arrests occurred in Isla Vista or on campus. Nearly twice as many individuals were arrested in April than March. In April, 76 individuals were arrested, compared to 39 individuals in March. This can likely be attributed to the unsanctioned street party known as Deltopia, which happens yearly during the first week of spring quarter.  This year, Deltopia happened on April 6; 38 arrests in the month occurred on that date, making up half of the total number in April. Another arrest occurred at 12:38 a.m. on April 7. This was a 50% increase from the previous year's Deltopia.   Over one-fourth of arrested individuals on Deltopia were confirmed UCSB students. For the rest of the month, about 30% of arrests were UCSB students. The oldest person arrested during Deltopia was 27. Over 90% of individuals arrested in I.V. during Deltopia were under 22. Approximately one-third of other arrests in April were of individuals 27 or older. Over half of the arrests in April were related to alcohol, similarly to previous months. Disorderly conduct due to alcohol was again the most common charge in April, with 39 people charged; 30 of these occurred during Deltopia.  Violation of probation, criminal conspiracy and vandalism were other common charges. Six individuals were arrested for violating their probations. Five were charged with criminal conspiracy, and another five were charged with vandalism.  Four individuals were charged with obstructing or resisting a police officer. Four were charged with possession of unlawful paraphernalia, which is equipment that is used to consume, process or store illegal substances. † The arrest map is based on daily arrest logs from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office and includes arrests that happen in I.V. as well as on the UCSB campus. The map includes data through September 2018 to the present. The map is updated daily by the Nexus news team, and can be found at dailynexus.com.  You can download the data used in this article here.
Print UCSB is full of nothing but spoiled colonist children who can't party without doing something illegal. Wannabe thugs who mommy didn't teach right. This commenter has to remain anonymous because he/she can't add. A rough count of the Sept.-April data is 330 people (~80% UCSB students) or 1.3% of all UCSB students.  So, UCSB is NOT ""full""ù of colonist children, whatever that means. Gees.

The report attributed this increase to ""ongoing campus education about recognizing and reporting interpersonal violence.""ù This increase was not consistent with other offenses which universities are mandated to report; the same number of reports of dating violence were filed in 2017 as 2018. Reports of domestic violence, rape and fondling each decreased slightly from last year.† Drug law violations in on-campus housing also decreased by over two-thirds from 2017 to 2018.

data,"Porter Raises Over $518,000 and Hartmann Raises Over $397,000 in 3rd District Supervisor Race",2-Mar-20,11:49 PM,['Hayley Tice'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-02/porter-raises-over-518000-and-hartmann-raises-over-397000-in-3rd-district-supervisor-race/,"Joan Hartmann and Bruce Porter have collectively raised over $900,000 in their rematch for the 3rd District supervisor seat after Hartmann defeated Porter in 2016 with about 54% of the vote. A third candidate, Santa Ynez Community Service District Director Karen Jones, expects to raise and spend under $2,000 for her entire campaign, according to a filing. The 3rd District, spanning UC Santa Barbara, Isla Vista, the Santa Ynez Valley and Guadalupe, has traditionally served as the swing vote on the Board of Supervisors. Porter raised approximately $400,000 ""î about $12,000 more than Hartmann ""î between Jan. 1, 2019 and Feb. 15, 2020, according to campaign filings. Since then, Porter has significantly outraised Hartmann in large donations. He received over $119,000 in donations larger than $1,000, while Hartmann has only reported $11,000, according to the campaign filings. Hartmann's top donor is Alice Gillaroo, a retired Santa Ynez resident. Gillaroo has donated $58,000 to Hartmann's campaign as of March 2, 2020. Other major donors to Hartmann's campaign include the Santa Barbara County Firefighters Government Committee, which donated $45,000, and Richard Mazess, a retired Santa Barbara resident who donated $20,000. Charles Zegar, a retired Santa Barbara resident, and Jack and Laura Dangermond, Redlands residents who founded the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), each donated $15,000 to her campaign.  Porter's largest donor is Buellton First, a political action committee based in Santa Ynez, which donated $120,000. Close behind is the Santa Barbara County Republican Party, which has donated about $70,000 in nonmonetary items to Porter's campaign. Porter has also extensively self-financed his campaign ""î he loaned his campaign $75,000 and donated another $18,000 toward nonmonetary items, such as ""campaign swag.""ù Other top donors to Porter's campaign include A. Brooks Firestone, a former county supervisor who donated $20,500, and the campaign of Bob Nelson, a candidate for the 4th District supervisor seat, which donated $15,000 to Porter. Nelson's campaign also provided a $10,000 loan and over $8,000 in yard signs to Porter's campaign.  About 77% of Hartmann's contributions have been from individual donors. In comparison, only about 49% of Porter's donations have been from individuals. Both have received heavy support from Santa Ynez residents. Hartmann received $74,600 while Porter received about $120,000, including his own donations and loans. Porter also drew significant funding from Solvang residents, about $57,000, and received approximately $31,000 from Santa Barbara. Hartmann also received a large amount ""î about $141,000 ""î from Santa Barbara residents who live outside the 3rd District.  Hartmann received two donations from Isla Vista residents, while Porter received none. Jonathan Abboud, the general manager of the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) who is running for State Assembly, donated $500 to Hartmann. One I.V. CSD director, Robert Geis III, donated $750 to Hartmann's campaign. † If you're interested in viewing the data we used in this story, you can download an Excel file of contributions to Porter's campaign here and to Hartmann's campaign here.

data,I.V. CSD 2020-21 Budget Projects Increase in Revenue Despite Coronavirus,11-Aug-20,10:31 PM,['Hayley Tice'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-11/i-v-csd-2020-21-budget-projects-increase-in-revenue-despite-coronavirus/,"The Isla Vista Community Services District expects revenues of over $1.36 million and expenses of approximately $1.26 million for the 2020-21 fiscal year. This is an increase of approximately $160,000 in revenue and over $500,000 in estimated actual expenses from the previous fiscal year, according to the budget, which was approved by the district's Board of Directors at its June 23 meeting. In the upcoming year, the budget estimates that $940,000, or approximately 69% of the district's revenue, will result from the User Utility Tax (UUT) ""î an 8% tax on gas, garbage removal, sewage, water and electricity in Isla Vista residences ""î approved by Isla Vistans in May 2018. An additional $191,000, or 14% of the expected revenue, is from a grant from UC Santa Barbara, according to the budget, which will be used to fund the Community Service Officers (CSO) Safety Stations and the UC Police Department Interpersonal Violence Investigator. The budget also allocates $142,000 in revenue for renting 970 Embarcadero Del Mar to host community programs, which the I.V. CSD is likely to acquire, according to Abboud. From March to June 2020, the Isla Vista Community Services District (I.V. CSD) saw significant declines in UUT revenue from several utilities as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and a subsequent decrease in housing density.  In that same period of time, electricity and gas revenue decreased by 41% and 66%, respectively. Trash and water revenue saw smaller declines: Trash revenue was approximately 8% lower, while water revenue was down about 23%. But Southern California Edison, the company that provides I.V.'s electricity, and the Goleta Water District, the entity responsible for the community's water, are considering rate increases that would increase UUT revenue, according to Jonathan Abboud, general manager of the I.V. CSD. While many other public agencies are facing ""financial crisis""ù as a result of the coronavirus, the I.V. CSD will be able to provide services at similar or even ""enhanced levels,""ù according to Spencer Brandt, board president of the I.V. CSD. ""We are in a really fortunate position right now,""ù Brandt said. The largest portion of the I.V. CSD's expenses in the new fiscal year will be for community programs, according to the budget.  About 40% of the budget ""î $544,000 ""î is designated for community programs. This includes the I.V. Community Center and Community Room, special projects, the Survivor Resource Center, a community garden, a compost collective and a possible community festival, the budget read. The I.V. Community Center and Community Room represents nearly three-quarters of this funding.  The approximately $400,000 in funding allocated for the I.V. Community Center and Community Room includes the cost of salaries for two new full-time staff ""î an assistant general manager for community programs and a community engagement coordinator ""î and utilities for the building, short- and long-term maintenance, janitorial staff, grant writing, marketing, programming and furniture. The budget also includes $55,000 for a possible community festival as an alternative to Deltopia, I.V.'s unsanctioned annual street party. However, the festival may or may not happen in 2021, depending on the coronavirus pandemic ""î there were less than 30 attendees of Deltopia 2020. Approximately $340,000 for operations are included in the budget, as well as $33,575 for the rental housing mediation program, $28,000 for a parking study and advertising for parking alternatives, $125,000 for public works and graffiti abatement and $38,000 for updating the I.V. Master Plan, according to the budget letter. Public safety programs comprise an additional 20%, or $253,000, of the I.V. CSD's 2020-21 budget. Approximately 60% of this portion is dedicated to the interpersonal violence investigator. The budget also allocates $59,000 for the CSO Safety Stations, $30,000 for community policing and $12,000 for a social media intern for the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP). This aspect of the budget drew opposition from a community member during public comment. Andrew Johnson, a political science graduate student at UCSB, said that this money should be used to fund other resources, citing the national movement to defund the police. ""You're not listening to how [the police are] targeting and making us feel very unsafe,""ù he told the board, singling out the funding for a social media intern for the IVFP and the district's use of contracting for police work. By funding the intern, the district is acting as ""a propaganda arm for the police,""ù according to Johnson. Director Jay Freeman said funding the IVFP intern was ""weirdly concerning,""ù although he believed the district was already ""on the hook for it""ù due to approving the spending at a previous meeting. The budget only allocates $30,000 for community policing, which Freeman called an ""interesting challenge to the community""ù to decrease ""the number of armed law enforcement.""ù If the I.V. CSD is unable to determine how to do this, the funds would not be spent, he said.

The released information includes the names of UCSB professors, the courses they've taught and the grades they've given from Fall Quarter 2015 to Winter Quarter 2021 for both undergraduate and graduate students, although it does not include students' names to protect privacy. The 2021 UCSB alum declined to speak with the Nexus.†  The Nexus categorized passing grades as A-D or passing if the class was taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.† The data reveals that there was a lower passing percentage during summer quarters compared to non-summer quarters at UCSB. There was also a spike in passing grades during Winter Quarter 2021 which Andrea Estrada, UCSB spokesperson, attributed to ""faculty members' responsiveness to students stresses as the University moved to entirely remote instruction.""ù  The Nexus examined all given grades over the past six years and found that 95% of the total grades given have been A-C's, P's or S's. Slightly more F's than D's have been distributed as well. 
Print One of the techniques in the classic book ""How to Lie with Statistics""ù is to grossly exaggerate the vertical scale to make minor variations seem dramatic.  In this instance, the variation over all quarters is 2.5 percentage points.  Taking out the exceptional winter 2020 covid quarter, the variation is about one percentage point.  Is this significant?  Your call. What the story does not mention, but is perhaps more significant, is that 4% of the grades taken P/NP were NP.  This is higher than the F rate every quarter except Summer 18, and  a full percentage point higher than the F rate for letter grades.

data,IVCSD Discusses Community-Based Policing for Isla Vista,5-Aug-21,12:10 AM,"['Atmika Iyer', 'Alex Rudolph']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-05/ivcsd-discusses-community-based-policing-for-isla-vista/,"Following the murder of George Floyd, the Isla Vista Community Services District began initiating discussions surrounding racial equity in the UC Santa Barbara college town. One such discussion revolved around community-based policing programs like the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program, which is employed in other college towns, including San Luis Obispo and D.C.† According to I.V. Community Services District (IVCSD) President and Director Spencer Brandt, the conversation about community-based methods of policing in I.V. had been an ongoing discussion prior to the murder of Floyd, but his murder ""push[ed] this conversation to the front and center""ù for the IVCSD. Current nonviolent responses in I.V. include Community Service Organization's† Isla Vista Safety Station program on Friday and Saturday nights, Santa Barbara County's Crisis and Recovery Emergency Services program for mental health emergencies and the I.V. Foot Patrol (IVFP) party registration ""î†a way to register large gatherings and parties with the local sheriff's department.  ""[Community-based policing] has been a conversation that we have had over a number of years. I know when we originally instituted the [Community Service Organization] safety station program,""ù Brandt said. ""And so I really see this last year as bringing these things front and center, and I think really forcing some difficult conversations about the nature of policing in Isla Vista in general.""ù While having this conversation, IVCSD requested policing data from IVFP, and the IVCSD evaluated trends in local crimes ""î†which include arrests, citations and no charges filed ""î†while considering local policing alternatives during their meeting on April 27.† IVFP provided crime data from 2013 and from 2018 to 2020, which revealed many trends, including the following: A majority of crimes committed in I.V. are nonviolent, and Black people make up approximately 3% of the population but around 6% of crimes.† According to IVCSD Director Ethan Bertrand, examining the college town during the weekend provides a glimpse into why policing in I.V. is so problematic. ""Just looking around Isla Vista on a Friday or Saturday night, you can see what is wrong, you see, many young people being stopped while walking through the community of suspicion of committing some sort of low level offense, and sometimes the person has done nothing wrong, and it's a negative interaction that was unnecessary,""ù Bertrand said in an interview with the Nexus.† Of the top 10 crime categories, the Nexus only classifies 6.3% of the crimes as violent within the graphs and charts below. These violent crimes include resisting arrest, fighting ""î which includes battery and fighting in public ""î robberies/burglaries/theft and abuse.† The majority of crimes can be classified as related to alcohol, partying or disorderly conduct. The alcohol category includes charges such as minor in possession, possession of an open container and being drunk in public. The partying category includes loud noise/music and festival ordinance violations. Disorderly conduct includes urinating in public, public nuisance and disturbing someone else in public. Alcohol-related offenses make up the majority of crimes, and this is consistent across all age groups. Ages below 25 are responsible for most of the partying and disorderly conduct charges. 21-year-olds commit more crimes than any other age group, with 84% of the crimes being committed by 18- to 23-year-olds. When presenting the data to the board of directors, IVCSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud highlighted that despite making up only 3% of the population, Black people constitute 6% of both charged and uncharged crimes. According to Brandt, there were a few trends that stuck out to the IVCSD from the data provided by I.V. Community Resource Deputy Justin Schroeder: the vast amount of time and resources spent on minor crimes and certain racial components to policing in I.V.† ""There's a significant amount of time and resources that are spent by law enforcement on very minor crimes. And we see that in the data that those types of crimes and the rest and citation for those types of things on Friday and Saturday nights,""ù Brandt said.† ""And these are things like [being] drunk in public, minor possession of alcohol, open containers and the two different types of noise ordinances. Having seen that and also, having just lived here for five years and seeing how it actually plays out on a Friday and Saturday night ""î†you know that. I think that it would be wrong not to see that there's a better way of doing things.""ù Brandt told the Nexus that the biases that exist in policing ""î†which became a national conversation following the murder of George Floyd ""î are a call to action for more community-based policing programs.† ""If you're Black and living in Isla Vista, you're more likely to be cited or arrested for these types of crimes than if you're white. And I think there's a really important racial justice component of alternative response as well,""ù Brandt said. ""So, I think that because of the Black Lives Matter movement, this is something that the public has a broad awareness of and I think is really demanding of us to continue, because we just can't do business as usual anymore,""ù he continued.† Bertrand shared his own experience with police in I.V., when he was stopped by law enforcement while drinking kombucha and walking down Del Playa Drive. The experience highlighted the time and resources law enforcement spends on potential minor crimes and how some minorities experience policing in I.V.† ""It was pretty quiet out, and I was walking down Del Playa, listening to a podcast on police reform of all things (it'll be ironic in a minute). I was listening to this podcast, just going on a walk, just relaxing, and I was drinking kombucha,""ù Bertrand said. ""And a police vehicle drives by me, then it turns around and drives by me again. And then it turns around one more time and drives and pulls me over while I'm walking.""ù The police officers circled Bertrand, pulled him over, asked to inspect his drink without having any reason to believe he was carrying an open container, then let him go.† ""While on the surface level, it's kind of funny that I was pulled over for drinking tea, it's really not. While I can make light of that, it's like really not, because it was very intimidating. It was so scary to be circled multiple times,""ù Bertrand continued.† ""It was clear something was wrong, and it was at night, I was alone, and I just kind of felt powerless and threatened in that moment, because I didn't know why they were stopping me. It turned out they were stopping me for something very trivial. And something that is something that couldn't be more legal, as far as drinking a soft drink while walking in your own neighborhood.""ù In order to create a system of policing that addresses racial biases and fits the needs of a college town like I.V., the IVCSD decided to explore the Student Neighborhood Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.). S.N.A.P. is a student and community-based form of responding to minor violations as a first response.  S.N.A.P. is currently employed in the college towns of both California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo and Georgetown University. Christine Wallace, the San Luis Obispo Police Department neighborhood outreach manager, spoke to IVCSD during their June 8 meeting and presented the operations of her San Luis Obispo program, which centers education about noise ordinance laws as a first response before involving police for tickets or citations.† Wallace described the S.N.A.P. program as ""a peer-to-peer model ""¶ [that] address[es] civility and livability issues in the neighborhoods off campus.""ù Student civilian employees visit residences with complaints against them and offer education about local laws and ordinances that prohibit their behavior or ""î†in the case that a residence's behavior is reported but not unlawful ""î†a S.N.A.P. employee will visit the residence and let them know.† ""Our program is set up ""¶ to where it's really education first. I do a ton of outreach ""î not during COVID, a ton of outreach in regular life ""î to incoming students, to Greek life, to clubs, to organizations, student government,""ù Wallace said in an interview with the Nexus. ""I'm trying to be on campus and in front of people as much as possible, to give them the education information about what the city of San Luis Obispo municipal codes are.""ù† Wallace said that a majority of interactions that S.N.A.P. employees have are actually positive.† ""Generally speaking, most interactions that S.N.A.P. [has] ""î†with student residents especially ""î are polite and professional,""ù she said. ""It's very few times when we have someone that's over intoxicated that wasn't in their mind, and [we have] a terrible interaction.""ù† However, Wallace said that S.N.A.P. employees contact the San Luis Obispo Police Department if the interaction doesn't go smoothly. ""If the residents that they speak to are aggressive, uncooperative, all of those kinds of commerce things that could happen on the negative side, then our S.N.A.P. team requests assistance from the patrol folk. Pretty rare that that happens,""ù Wallace said to the Nexus. Wallace added that one struggle her program faces is being taken seriously while visiting residences.† ""To use a very derogatory term, a lot of our student residents call [our] staff, Student Nazis Against Parties. That drives me absolutely insane. I can't change the narrative so I don't try,""ù she said. ""I just try to give as much education as I can about what their role is. They're paid civilian employees. They don't patrol, they respond to complaints that are received by dispatch, and they're just like y'all.""ù Another struggle Wallace cited was the general traction behind defunding the police. Though S.N.A.P. falls in line with the goals of defunding the police ""î by funnelling money into community-based programs ""î†Wallace said that even association with law enforcement made recruitment for S.N.A.P. fairly difficult. Wallace added that the conversation surrounding racism within police departments is necessary.† ""In general, across the state, recruitment for jobs associated with law enforcement have greatly declined, and that includes civilian positions. So, because the profession of law enforcement is under a great deal of scrutiny ""î as it should be ""î there have been communities across our nation that have shown to have really challenged, poorly run, racist, law enforcement agencies,""ù Wallace said.†† ""It's our responsibility as folks who are still in the profession, [who] want to make it just, make it antiracist, make it helpful, make it professional, to recruit and find and train the people that are going to shift to provide good policing and law enforcement for our communities,""ù she continued. ""We have a ways to get there though, and it's going to simply take so much more intentional thought and process to help us find those people that are going to be essentially the change makers for the profession.""ù When asked about the possible ridicule of student employees in the S.N.A.P. program, Brandt said he's heard similar language used against current law enforcement in I.V., and that the desired outcome of a program like S.N.A.P. outweighs the negative effects of any ridicule.† ""I think that that is just something that comes part and parcel with the fact that we've got a community of young people, and they want to have a social life, and they want to have fun,""ù she said.† ""I think that the right question, or the question that I always think of, is: What's gonna get us closer to the outcome that we want? And is it better if you've got a student who's there and can potentially level with the person that they're responding to and achieve the desired outcome without the justice system being involved? Or is it better if it's just the law enforcement officer?""ù Brandt continued.† Currently, IVCSD is looking to engage with student and community organizations in order to understand what the community needs from local policing. In addition, the IVCSD is looking to expand their current efforts, such as safety stations, to more locations. This ongoing effort is still in the process of development. The Nexus will continue to report on this developing story.†

The services district expects a revenue and expenditure of $1.46 million ""î†an approximate 6% increase from the previous fiscal year.† The Isla Vista Community Services District (IVCSD), formed in 2016, began receiving funding two years later and was started with the goal of improving the quality of life and infrastructure as the college town's local government. The CSD is composed of five democratically elected members and two additional appointed seats. Though certain programs were over-budgeted for wiggle room, under the current set of numbers, the IVCSD will spend all projected revenue except for $628.† The current budget has an increase in revenue by $85,766.31 and an increase in expenditures by $90,735.50 from the previous fiscal year.† The User Utility Tax (UUT) is expected to generate $1.024 million for the IVCSD, making up the majority of the budget ""î 70% ""î and continues to be IVCSD's primary source of funding.† The remaining funds come from UCSB to pay for the Sexual Assault & Interpersonal Violence Prevention and Investigations program, Isla Vista Safety Stations program and a grant from the I.V. Community Relations Committee within the UCSB Associated Students.† The Sustainable Transportation Equity Project (S.T.E.P.) grant is a new source of funding for the CSD as well. The S.T.E.P. grant helps develop equitable mobility plans for communities.† The CSD broke down their budget into the following major categories: operations, community programs, housing, public safety, parking, public works and community planning.† Though total spending is only proposed to increase by 6%, a few programs, such as operations, community programs and parking, have major allocation changes. Operations and parking have a significant increase, while the community programs sector has a significant decrease.†  Operations†  The budget for operations ""î which funds salaries, legal fees, advertising and administrative costs ""î increased by 48% and is $163,157.90 more than that of the previous year at $502,690.90.† The operations budget is further broken down into categories: staff, communications, office, admin and board. The staff category includes funds for salaries, health care and retirement and is the biggest change in the operations budget from the previous year. For the upcoming fiscal year, salaries are going to increase from $150,000 to $246,000 ""î an increase of $96,000 ""î in part, due to the hiring of a community engagement director.† Community Programs  The I.V. Community Center and Community Room funding fell from $544,142.50 in the previous year to $397,790.50 this year ""î a decrease of $146,352. This category of the budget has many significant changes from the previous fiscal year, including the addition of a salary for a part-time programming coordinator, a position which is not filled currently, and a $5,000 increase for programming and events.† The majority of the decrease is due to utilities and maintenance not being included in the budget, as they are currently unknown and can be changed through a budget adjustment at a later time, IVCSD General Manager Jonathan Abboud said during the Aug. 16 IVCSD budget meeting.† Utilities and maintenance are currently unknown variables because IVCSD is still negotiating property terms with the county and has yet to reach a resolution. For the previous fiscal year, regular maintenance and utilities were budgeted for $81,500. In addition, $100,000 for maintenance and long-term renovation that was budgeted for the previous fiscal year was not included while IVCSD negotiates with the county. Funding for the I.V. Community Compost Collective, which falls under the community programs category, has increased from $38,995 to $80,454 ""î an increase of $41,459 ""î $24,000 of which is for the new Compost Collective program manager. Housing† In comparison to the 2020-21 fiscal year, the housing budget decreased from $33,575 to $21,705. IVCSD eliminated their expenditures from advertising and IT hardware maintenance and decreased their contractual service expenditures by $10,000. The current allocation will go toward IVCSD's housing remediation program, which helps† resolve disputes between tenants and their landlords.† Public Safety The overall budget for public safety decreased for the upcoming fiscal year as IVCSD cut its funding for community policing and the Isla Vista Foot Patrol social media intern, which faced controversy because some community members described the position as ""a propaganda arm for the police.""ù† The funding for safety stations, however, has increased from $59,000 to $85,500 this upcoming year to include an additional tent on Friday and Saturday nights and during large events for a total of three tents. Parking The budget for parking increased from $28,000 to $135,500. All but $25,000 of that funding comes from the S.T.E.P. grant, which the IVCSD won from the California Air Resources Board to ""develop an equity-based, community mobility plan for Isla Vista.""ù According to IVCSD Board President and Director Spencer Brandt, the money will be used to analyze and improve street parking and fund a project that promotes more walking, biking, skateboarding and public transit use. Public Works The public works budget increased by $9,800 from the previous fiscal year. Within the public works section budget, $129,800 is currently budgeted for community beautification ""î an increase of $59,800 from the previous fiscal year. The increase is due to the elimination of the infrastructure category, as the funds were instead transferred to the beautification category this year. During the previous year, IVCSD budgeted $50,000 for infrastructure.† Community Planning The community planning budget decreased from $53,000 to $30,000 for the upcoming fiscal year. The decrease is because IVCSD eliminated funding for advertising which saved $3,000. The CSD also reduced the allocation for contractual services from $50,000 to $30,000.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Aug. 26, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.†

data,2020 Census Data Shows Demographic Shifts In I.V.,3-Sep-21,1:26 PM,"['Atmika Iyer', 'Alex Rudolph']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-03/2020-census-data-shows-demographic-shifts-in-i-v/,"Over the past 10 years, Isla Vista's share of the Asian population rose by 12%, while the share of the white population decreased by 17%, according to new data released by the United States Census Bureau on population trends between 2010 and 2020. The U.S. conducts a census count every 10 years to ascertain an updated count of the U.S. population. The data then dictates the number of seats per state within the House of Representatives. The census also informs distribution of funds, assistance to states and localities, redistricting and reapportion of Congressional seats. The country's 24th Census asked U.S. residents how many people live in their household, as well as their gender, age, birthday and race. According to the 2020 Census, between 2010 and 2020, the population of I.V. and number of people living in UC Santa Barbara-affiliated housing increased by 678 and 1,436, respectively. The data collected from the 2020 Census shows that white people make up 47% of I.V.'s population. White people are overrepresented on Del Playa Drive, making up 60 to 83% of the population on various parts of the street. In addition, white people are the majority demographic at West Campus Faculty Housing""î a set of condos provided to UCSB faculty members ""î at 74%. However, white people are underrepresented in UCSB's main campus dorms ""î excluding Santa Catalina ""î making up only 30% of the people living there. By contrast, Asians make up the majority of the population living at UCSB's campus dorms and are the largest population at the San Clemente Villages ""î a set of on-campus apartments. In comparison to 2010, the Black population living at UCSB and in I.V. has gone from 2.6% to 1.8% in 2020. This decrease is in line with the county's trends as well, where the Black population went from 2% in 2010 to 1.6% in 2020. The 2020 Census was conducted amongst myriad obstacles, including the COVID-19 pandemic and former President Donald Trump's decision to end the census approximately two weeks early. Many journalists and experts said that consequences of ending the count early would be that ""people of color, immigrants, renters, [and] other historically undercounted groups may be missed or counted inaccurately,""ù according to NPR's Hansi Lo Wang. Despite these various obstacles, the Census Bureau said it is confident with the quality of its data. ""We have produced reliable and usable statistics that we and the public expect. While no census is perfect, we are confident that today's redistricting results meet our high data quality standards,""ù said Ron Jarmin, acting director of the U.S. Census Bureau, during the Aug. 12 press conference. ""It is too early to speculate on undercounts or overcounts for any specific demographic group and we look forward to the release of the post enumeration survey results in 2022 which will provide information on coverage of demographic groups in the 2020 census.""ù However, because many students lived in their respective familial households instead of their I.V. residences when the census was collecting data, ""hundreds of thousands of U.S. college students who normally live off campus in non-university housing""ù counted themselves in alternative locations, the Associated Press reported. One possible consequence of an undercount is insufficient federal and state funds, which could impact the quality of local infrastructure, public education and the national school lunch program. Whether or not an undercount occurred in I.V. remains uncertain. The Nexus will continue to investigate the difference between the number of people reported on the census in 2020, versus the number of people who have returned to the town for the upcoming in-person school year in addition to I.V.'s non-college-student population and will release that data in a later article.

In the 2020-21 school year, these two counties were followed by the following Bay Area counties: Marin County, Santa Clara County, Contra Costa County and San Mateo County. The California counties with the lowest number of students at UCSB are Alpine County and Sierra County, where no student from either county attended in the 2020-21 school year. However, the California counties with the lowest share of students per county population for counties having more than 30 students were Madera County, Shasta County and Humboldt County.†† Out-Of-State Students† Outside of California, Washington State tied with New York as the most common state of origin for the 2021-22 school year. In the 2020-21 school year, these states were followed by Illinois, New Jersey and Texas.† New York has been the most common state of origin since the 2006-07 school year. South Dakota was the least state of origin with only one student in the 2020-21 school year. The only two states that didn't have any students attend since the 2000-01 school year were North Dakota in 2015-16 and West Virginia in 2016-17 and 2017-18.

International students During the 2010-11 school year, 847 students came from countries outside of the U.S. In the years since, this number has been increasing each year except for the previous one. The number peaked at 4,142 students during the 2019-20 school year and 3,969 during the 2020-21 school year.† The number of countries international students are from is 131 in the past two decades, with 107 countries in the 2020-21 school year.† While the number of domestic students has only increased by 797 since the 2010-11 school year, from 23,358 to 24,525 students, the number of international students has increased by 3,296, going from 3.5% of the student body to 14.6%. The number of Chinese students went from 198 students in 2010-11, making up 23% of international students, to 2,797 students in 2020-21, making up 70% of the international students.

UCPD worked with Campus Security Authorities and the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office to compile crime s that occured on university property, including off-campus housing and surrounding public properties. The report also states that all reported crimes are listed, regardless of whether a police investigation was conducted.

data,PRA Reveals Grading Trends From UCSB Over the Last Six Years,29-Oct-21,11:45 PM,['Alex Rudolph'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-29/pra-reveals-grading-trends-from-ucsb-over-the-last-six-years/,"In July, all UC Santa Barbara students' grades from the past six years were made available online on GitHub through a Public Records Act request made by a UCSB alumnus. The data shows an increase in the percentage of students receiving A's and better grades overall since Winter Quarter 2020.† The Nexus also created a website for students to look through past grading trends.† In July, the Nexus reported that all UC Santa Barbara grades from Fall 2015 to Winter 2021, which were obtained through California Freedom of Information Act, were published online by an anonymous UCSB alum. In total, 1,739,704 grades were received by students in the 44,788 courses offered over 22 quarters. From the 2015-16 to the 2018-19 school years, the average number of courses taken by students in the fall, winter and spring quarters were fairly constant. From 2015-16 to the 2017-18 school years, students averaged taking just under four courses per quarter.† In the 2018-19 school year, the average number of courses taken by students increased to 4.41 courses for the fall, winter and spring quarters, compared to an average of 3.91 in the previous three years. Winter Quarter 2020 was the first time since the 2015-16 school year that students took fewer courses, on average, in the winter quarter than in the fall.† In the summer quarters from 2016 to 2019, students took 2.51 courses on average. For Summer Quarter 2020, students took 3.42 on average, nearly an entire course more than the previous years. Many courses changed their grading distribution to accommodate students during the pandemic. Compared to grades given before Spring Quarter 2020, 409 courses changed the percentage of A's, B's or C's given out by more than 30 percentage points. Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology 3 (EEMB 3) is the largest course, in terms of the number of students, that had the percentage of a grade change by more than 30 percentage points since before Spring Quarter 2020. The percentage of students receiving an A in EEMB 3 increased from 22%, prior to the pandemic, to 71% since Spring Quarter 2020.† As a greater percentage of students received A's in EEMB 3 since Spring Quarter 2020, the percentage of students receiving B's decreased by 18 percentage points and the percentage of students receiving C's decreased by 22 percentage points. From Fall Quarter 2015 to Winter Quarter 2020, students received 1,324,937 grades, 91% of which were letter grades. From Winter Quarter 2020 to Winter Quarter 2021, an additional 414,767 grades were received, 93% of which were letter grades. The percentage of students receiving A's increased from 46% to 63% as the percentage of students receiving every other grade decreased after Winter Quarter 2020. Prior to Winter Quarter 2020, 5.6% of courses were taken as Pass/No Pass which decreased to 4.1% in the quarters after Winter 2020. Over this time period, the percentage of students receiving a No Pass grade decreased from 4.3% to 3.1%. The percentage of students receiving No Pass grades is also higher than the percentage of students receiving F's for every quarter except for Summer Quarter 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the last two available quarters, Fall Quarter 2020 and Winter Quarter 2021.

data,On-Campus Bike Thefts Increase From Previous Years,7-Nov-21,11:00 AM,"['Stella Jia', 'Alex Rudolph']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-07/on-campus-bike-thefts-increase-from-previous-years/,"UC Santa Barbara returned with its annual increase of on-campus bike thefts this fall quarter with the most bike thefts in the last three years.† During the first month of fall quarter, there were 76 reported bike thefts on campus in the first 30 days after move-in weekend on Sept. 19. This is an 85% increase in bike thefts from the 41 bike thefts in the first 30 days from 2019's move-in weekend and 347% from the 17 bike thefts in 2020.  UC Police Department (UCPD) Lieutenant Dan Wilson said one possible reason for the increase of bike thefts is an increase in crimes of opportunity due to two new classes of students entering campus in person for the first time this quarter.† Given the popularity of biking on campus, Wilson said that individuals affiliated and unaffiliated with UCSB may be involved in these thefts, including people who reside outside of Santa Barbara County.† Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Community Resource Deputy Sheriff Justin Schroeder said that there are two periods of the year with the most bike thefts: move-in and move-out. ""One period is now, with the start of the school year which is attributed to a lot of new students unfamiliar with the area and not properly locking bikes. Then the other period is towards the end of the year when move-out is going on,""ù Schroeder said. While the move-in period results in bike thefts increasing due to more crimes of opportunity from students not properly locking bikes, bike thefts in the move-out period are more organized.† ""The move-out period usually deals with more organized type crimes where they're cutting the locks. Each year we catch people with pickup trucks full of bicycles. They pose as property managers saying they're just clearing out the bike racks because all the students have moved out, but they haven't yet,""ù Schroeder said. Senior Lead Student Mechanic at the Associated Students Bike Shop Gianna Pineda, a fourth-year psychological and brain sciences and communication double major, said that oftentimes, only parts of bicycles are stolen. ""The most common of the repairs is a wheel replacement, which means replacing the wheel, rim strip, tire and tube. This repair can be anywhere from $70 to $150. This happens frequently when someone steals the front or rear wheel of a bike and leaves only the frame,""ù Pineda said. Wilson stated that the Community Service Organization's (CSO) bike registration program is the best way for students to get their stolen bike returned. The CSO's bike registration program gives serial numbers to bikes allowing them to be tracked. Thus, with each bike having its own serial number, UCPD can easily return stolen bikes to their owners.† The CSO also has a Summer Storage program where students can sign up to store their bikes in a secure location to prevent it from being stolen. Wilson also said that UCPD is working with stakeholders to create more prevention methods aimed toward bike theft reduction. One method involves looking at the environment and opportunities that cause people to steal, which may include dim lighting and hidden bike rack locations.† According to Wilson, the Santa Catalina Residence Hall is an example of their prevention work in action. Santa Catalina has bike racks located in front of Portola, which is both a well-lit area and easily open to the public eye, thus preventing crimes of opportunity. From Sept. 19 to Oct. 18, San Joaquin Villages had the highest number of bike thefts with 11 reported bike thefts, followed by Anacapa Residence Hall with seven reported bike thefts. Santa Catalina had five reported thefts and Portola Dining Commons had two reported thefts during that same time period.

In response to the rising cases, UC Santa Barbara chose to begin Winter Quarter 2022 entirely remotely for the first two weeks of instruction, but by the end of Week 1, allowed instructors to choose whether or not to hold class in person or remotely until Jan. 28.† The decision made UCSB the only UC school to not fully extend remote learning through Jan. 28 and went against the desires of many in the student body and community.† According to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD) Spokesperson Jackeline Ruiz, public health officials were not consulted in UCSB's decision to give instructors discretion over how to proceed with their classes.† When asked if the university consulted public health prior to deciding not to fully extend remote learning, UCSB Spokesperson Shelly Leachman said that the university is in regular contact with SBCPHD and observing its protocols, but did not say whether SBCPHD was consulted on that specific decision.† ""Instruction falls under the purview of Academic Senate and academic affairs. As the Chancellor's message highlights, the decision was made following extensive consultation with ""òthe Academic Senate and members of the faculty, deans and administrative colleagues, students, staff, and campus medical experts,'""ù Leachman said in a statement to the Nexus.† UCSB External Vice President of Statewide Affairs and UC Student Association President Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan, along with other leaders in Associated Students, advised against the decision to allow faculty to decide whether instruction will be remote or in person.† ""Chancellor Yang's decision to redirect blame onto faculty rather than take decisive leadership is extremely disappointing. We've offered Chancellor Yang and the COVID-19 Task Force polling, policy recommendations, and student testimonies in hopes of guiding the institution's response,""ù Quintero-Cubillan said in a statement to the Nexus. ""However, they've made it clear they do not value the input of student leadership or student voice.""ù† Students have tested positive by the hundreds since Week 1. The university received 130 positive tests on Jan. 4, peaked at 303 positive tests on Jan. 5 and had 132 positive tests on Jan. 8.† As of Jan. 12, UCSB is reporting 262 active cases, and the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department's (SBCPHD) COVID-19 Data Dashboard is reporting 635 active cases in Isla Vista.† Alex Rudolph / Daily Nexus COVID-19 Spikes Across UC System UCSB is not the only UC with a high number of positive COVID-19 cases, but all other UCs are staying online through Jan. 31 to mitigate the virus's spread.† Alex Rudolph / Daily Nexus UC Davis' cases peaked on Jan. 5 with 246 positive tests and on Jan. 8 with 138 positive cases. UC San Diego's cases also peaked on Jan. 5 with 577 positive tests among students. UC Santa Cruz's cases peaked on Jan. 5 with 115 positive cases, and UC Riverside reported 190 new cases on Jan. 3. During the week of Jan. 8, UC Irvine reported 1,622 active cases.† UC Berkeley's cases peaked on Jan. 7 with 202 positive cases; however, Berkeley's semester has not yet begun.

The university is so overwhelmed with positive cases that they have begun isolating students in off-campus hotels and offering $400 gift cards to students who isolate at home, the Mustang News reported. Alex Rudolph / Daily Nexus Majority of Schools Across California Are Online in January† The UC schools are not alone in their decision to hold classes remotely; many colleges throughout California and the U.S. have decided to begin their quarter or semester with remote instruction.† Alex Rudolph / Daily Nexus The Nexus gathered information about colleges with a population larger than 5,000 throughout California. However, because of the lack of information on all California colleges, this chart does not include every university with a population of higher than 5,000. Out of the 44 colleges shown on this map, 23 have chosen to begin their quarter or semester remotely.†  The SBCPHD's COVID-19 Data Dashboard shows that the 2021-22 winter surge in cases has eclipsed the 2020-21 surge in cases. The highest number of cases last year was on Jan. 10, 2021, with 779 cases. The peak of cases as of Jan. 10 this year is 1,300 cases on Jan. 8.† Active cases have gone up 80% from the previous two-week average of 3,628 cases to the current two-week average of 6,513 cases.

data,Students Frustrated by Modified Unit Cap for Class Registration,10-Feb-22,11:00 AM,"['Nisha Malley', 'Alex Rudolph']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-10/students-frustrated-by-modified-unit-cap-for-class-registration/,"Pass times for Spring Quarter 2022 began this week, and following UC Santa Barbara's introduction of a more restrictive unit limit for each pass time for Winter Quarter 2022 class registration, students reflected on the process of course selection and registration. As a result of the changes, students could only enroll in a maximum of 10 units total during Pass 1, the initial registration period, followed by a maximum of 15 units total during Pass 2 and 21 units total during Pass 3. This is a change from previous quarters, when students could enroll in up to 13.5 units total during Pass 1, 19 units total during Pass 2 and 21 units total during Pass 3. The policy also prevented all students from achieving full-time status ""î which requires a minimum enrollment of 12 units ""î until their second registration period. A total of 22,496 undergraduate students were enrolled in Winter Quarter 2022, with only 756 of them taking less than 12 units, according to third-week registration reports from UCSB's Office of Budget & Planning. Kurt Rhim, a fourth-year communication major, said that the change affected his plans to graduate early. ""I was basically set to graduate early, my communication major classes would have been done mainly by the end of winter quarter ""¶ but now with the cap, I may need to stay an extra quarter in the summer,""ù Rhim said. Because of the lowered unit limits and class capacity maxed by Pass 1 and 2, Rhim was only able to enroll in 12 units for Winter Quarter 2022, although he hoped to take 16 units. However, Rhim said he understood that he wasn't the only student to be negatively impacted by the change. ""This might place a bit of a wrench in my plans, but that's just how it is. I know other people are going through the same thing too, so I wasn't going to be too upset or complain about it,""ù Rhim continued. ""I still get my three courses, and I think that's still plenty of workload sometimes. So this is kind of inconvenient, but it's OK.""ù Upon data collection by the Nexus, a total of 99,203 seats were offered on GOLD in Winter Quarter 2022 across all undergraduate courses. By the end of Pass 1, 52,690 seats were filled, making up 53.1% of all offered seats. An additional 22,381 seats were filled in Pass 2 and 8,100 seats in Pass 3.† From the first day of class on Jan. 3 to the Friday of the first week, Jan. 7, 9,801 courses were dropped. At the end of the first week, 72,763 seats were filled, 2,308 fewer than at the end of Pass 2. For Winter Quarter 2022, 2,032 different lectures were offered ""î 501 of which were completely full by the end of the first pass time. By Pass 3, 855, or 42.1% of lectures, were completely full. On Nov. 8, the first day of Pass 1, 11 lectures completely filled up, with the first full lecture ""î MCDB 101BH from the molecular, cellular and developmental biology department ""î reaching full capacity by noon. At the end of Pass 1, six departments had more than 70% of their seats filled. In the political science department, 86% of the seats were filled ""î the most of all departments ""î with 14 of its 25 offered lectures completely full.† At the end of Pass 2, six departments had more than 90% of their seats filled. Asian American studies and political science had 97.2% and 96.7% of their total seats filled, respectively, with 84.2% and 76% of their lectures completely full. In total, 13 departments that offered more than 5 lectures had at least half of their lectures completely full by the end of Pass 2.† Second-year dance major Lilly Teisher expressed the stress and frustration that stemmed from only being allowed to enroll in 10 units during Pass 1. ""It was really stressful only being able to sign up for 10 [units] and everything starts filling up, especially when I'm trying to take GEs, especially when I'm [trying to be a] double major, trying to take these freshman major classes and not having the space,""ù she said. ""It definitely made it really stressful for me, and I know my roommates were very stressed out as well.""ù Teisher said she approached her course selection process in fall quarter by prioritizing academic classes, which tended to fill up much faster than her major-related dance courses. She said that her strategy backfired when a dance class she needed filled up, and she was unable to enroll in the necessary number of dance units to remain on track to obtain her B.A. with a four-year graduation plan. ""I was hoping just to enroll in the academic classes because [in] dance, obviously, not a lot of people are going to be signing up for ballet and modern dance,""ù Teisher said. ""There was a new dance class that they had added called street dance, and I was like, ""òOK, I'll add that later, I'm always able to get into the dance classes ""¶ ' By the time I got to Pass 2, I literally could not add it to my schedule, and so I didn't have the dance credits that I needed for this quarter,""ù she continued. Teisher eventually enrolled in the dance class by crashing the course in person on the first day of instruction after struggling to obtain an add code over winter break or receive responses from professors over email. She emphasized the uniqueness of her situation, given that the majority of Winter Quarter 2022 classes began remotely and that only a few classes, such as dance, had in-person instruction. ""I was able to get into the class, but I had to email the advisor a bunch of times ""¶ Finally, they gave me an add code. At first, they were like, ""òJust stay on the waitlist.' The waitlist wasn't moving, they weren't going to let anyone off of it, and so I finally went in [and talked to the professor].""ù Teisher said that she preferred the previous course selection process. ""I was very frustrated, but it's OK now. It just makes it a lot harder, especially when we had the option of 12 or 13 units before. With that, you're able to take three 4-unit classes, and now you can't even do that,""ù Teisher said. Fourth-year Spanish and sociology double major Ally Chen said she had less pressure during her registration period, as her courses were upper-division and, overall, less impacted. ""I'm a fourth-year, so for me, it wasn't that much of a big deal because I was all in upper-divs anyway ""¶ From what I've heard, if you were in [an] upper-division [class], if you were doing your major already, then it wasn't as difficult,""ù Chen said. Third-year psychological & brain sciences major Yasra Alsaudi also had an easier time enrolling in classes because she has priority class registration, which is intended to help her catch up on graduation requirements after transferring from UC Riverside.† ""I technically got priority enrollment ""¶ so that's why I don't think it affected me that much,""ù Alsaudi said. She described being able to enroll in a chemistry course with her preferred time and choice of professor, compared to friends who faced greater difficulty. ""I was able to get the chem professor that I wanted and the time that I wanted,""ù Alsaudi said. ""[My friends] had to debate which class they should drop or not, so it was just stressful. It was a mess for a lot of people.""ù Teisher said the stressful experience of Winter Quarter 2022 registration will once again be mirrored in her upcoming Spring Quarter 2022 course selection. ""I'm definitely just going to do the same thing with academic classes and just hope that the dance classes I need don't fill up again,""ù Teisher said. ""That's my only option because the academic ones fill up so fast. I'm not looking forward to it.""ù While disappointed with the current system, Rhim voiced that some students may have had positive experiences. ""I think, like everyone else, [I was] disappointed when the unit cap was placed, but I know there were a lot of people who I'm sure were actually very pleased about it but were just too timid or felt like they were outnumbered to speak up,""ù Rhim said.

In the last seven years, the percentage of Black graduate students has risen 1.9 percentage points, from 1.4% in 2014 to 3.53% in 2022, according to UCSB's Office of Budget & Planning campus profiles.† The percentage of degrees awarded to Black undergraduates in S.T.E.M. departments reached a high of 3.31% in 2016 and has increased by 0.31 percentage points since 2017. Since 1997, the percentage of Black undergraduate and graduate students has increased by 1.05 percentage points, from 2.66% to 3.70% of the student population. The number of Black students has gone from 503 students in 1997-98 to 967 students in 2021-22. The 2017-18 school year had the highest percentage of Black students, at 4.35% with 1,090 students.  Computer science professor Tim Sherwood and Black studies professor Sharon Tettegah founded the Sustaining Engagement & Enrichment in Data Science Program in partnership with the Center for Black Studies Research in 2021.† In doing so, the computer science department brought on Tettegah as an affiliate faculty member to deepen the computer science department's collaboration with the Black studies department and better serve computer science students through projects, such as professor William Wang's Center for Responsible Machine Learning ""î which emphasizes the social impacts of AI and machine learning. The computer science department has had a below-average percentage of degrees by Black students for the past decade, except for 2015, when it reached 3%. For the past three years, Black students have made up 1% of degrees conferred in the computer science department. Despite having a below-average percentage of Black students, the computer science department has employed various programs to increase diversity within their department. The computer science department won the following grants focused on increasing diversity, according to professor and Chair Tevfik Bultan: a Center for Inclusive Computing data grant, ""Scaling the Early Research Scholars Program""ù and ""An inclusive and In-Depth Computing Curriculum to help Non-majors Learn Small Patterns to Solve Big Problem.""ù ""We partnered with the National Science Foundation to develop a departmental plan for broadening participation in computing,""ù Bultan said. ""We won multiple grants that have the specific intention of creating a more diverse and inclusive program for our students including an award from the Center for Inclusive Computing and the creation of our Early Research Scholars Program.""ù† The Early Research Scholars Program is supported by the National Science Foundation grant titled ""Scaling the Early Research Scholars Program.""ù The principal investigator for this award is professor Diba Mirza.†  Since 2016, the psychological & brain sciences department has had an above-average percentage of degrees by Black students, reaching 6% in 2016 and 2019, and 4% in 2021. According to psychology professor and Department Chair Shelly Gable, the department created a new committee focused on improving diversity within the department in 2020. ""We formed a diversity, equity and inclusion committee a few years ago in our department, which is made up of faculty, graduate students and staff as well as undergraduate liaison from some of our undergraduate club programs,""ù she said. The committee is currently working on a Strategic Action Plan to address all aspects of the community, from the undergraduate students to faculty members.

data,Political Engagement Patterns of UCSB Professors,18-Jul-22,9:38 AM,"['Julia Ong', 'Cameron Clark', 'Stella Jia']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-07-18/political-engagement-patterns-ucsb-professors/,"While there are many methods of measuring political engagement on our campus, the political donations of UC Santa Barbara professors are a metric that we can track using publicly accessible data. This information was collected by the Federal Election Commission from political organizations, and includes the employment, occupation and other demographic information of political campaign donors. We tracked these donations over the time period from 2015 to 2021. Our data included donors who self-reported their employer as ""University of California,""ù ""UCSB,""ù or ""UC SANTA BARBARA,""ù and had addresses in one of 10 local area codes. This meant that some donors in the data set were not professors. However, this did not significantly impact any trends, because the majority of reported occupations were ""Professor""ù or some variation of a teaching occupation. How much do most professors donate? Source: Federal Election Commission Almost all donation amounts were in the $0-100 range, although the highest single donation was $2,500. The majority of donations were less than $10, which could indicate that the majority of UCSB professors were only weakly committed to supporting political organizations. However, when combined with trends in the volume of donations as discussed below, this points instead to consistent support through small recurring donations. Which political organizations are receiving this money? Source: Federal Election Commission More than 80% of the money donated went to two organizations: ActBlue and It Starts Today. ActBlue was founded in 2004 and is a fundraising platform for Democratic candidates. ActBlue also caters to small-dollar donors, and each contribution made through ActBlue is earmarked for another campaign and still considered an individual donation. The other major recipient, It Starts Today, was founded in 2017 to crowdsource support for Democratic candidates. Donations to It Starts Today followed an unusual pattern over the years, with a sharp increase in donations beginning in 2017, holding steady in 2018 and decreasing to almost nothing in 2019. As expected from a presidential election year, ActBlue received the most donations in 2020 ""ì the number of donations spiked that year. As shown in the previous two charts, the increase in our data was largely driven by the trend in donations to ActBlue.  How did the number of donations change over time?  There was also a larger number of donations in 2017 and 2018, which was driven by increased donations to It Starts Today. This organization operates on a system of small monthly donations, which are then held for Democratic nominees in the next election cycle. Donors who were galvanized into action by the results of the 2016 elections likely wanted to put their money to use right away. This caused a large number of donations to It Starts Today in both 2017 and 2018, instead of the more expected pattern of increased donations only in election years as seen with ActBlue. The popularity of It Starts Today likely waned for subsequent election years due to Democratic success in 2018. The majority of donations in our data were sent to two organizations focusing on individual contributions, showing that the politically engaged UCSB community was progressive-leaning and interested in grassroots change.

The CDC recommends counties with high COVID-19 community transmission level to wear masks indoors in public and on public transportation, stay updated with COVID-19 vaccinations and for individuals to get tested if symptoms show.† Ôªø The number of total deaths within the last seven days as of July 14 is under 10.

data,"Rating ""Rate My Professor""ù: exploring trends in UCSB professor ratings",28-Aug-22,2:59 PM,"['Zach Gold', 'Gama Aristondo', 'Stella Jia']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-08-28/rating-rate-my-professor/,"Introduction When choosing classes to enroll in, students flock to RateMyProfessors.com every year, an online database of more than 19 million reviews about 1.7 million professors that has served as a resource to guide course selection for students worldwide. The Daily Nexus Data Team used a Python script that automatically visited each UC Santa Barbara professor's rating site and scraped information on each review available. Using this method, the Daily Nexus Data Team collected 48,926 reviews from 2,913 professors and lecturers dating back to 2003. Side note: The scraper captured 90-95% of reviews left for professors at UCSB.† How does the quality and difficulty of ratings vary over time?  In addition to reviews left by students, the Rate My Professors (RMP) website collects two key metrics from users: quality of the professor and difficulty of their teaching, both recorded on a scale of 1-5. The following data visualize the trends in how the quality and difficulty of ratings changed over time by taking the average rating of all professors in every department at UCSB. In 2013, the difficulty of professors reached a minimum rating of 2.8 out of 5 stars, corresponding with a relatively high rating in quality. As the difficulty of teaching begins to rise after 2013, the quality of teaching follows a decreasing trend. Overall, there is a pattern where a lower difficulty corresponded with better ratings in quality. In 2020, the quality of teaching, which had increased the year prior, begins to decrease while the difficulty reaches a peak, likely due to remote learning.† Fourth-year psychological & brain sciences major Nishay Chitale was homeschooled and took courses at a city college before coming to UCSB, giving him six years of experience with RMP. He said that the transition to remote learning in 2020 affected the quality of teaching he was receiving from his courses.† ""In terms of the quality, it depended on the professor. With every course, the professor is the biggest determinant for the quality, but I felt like it was magnified during remote learning,""ù Chitale said. ""Bad professors were even worse, while good professors were able to maintain a relatively similar quality to in-person learning.""ù Student Perspective The Data Team released a survey on the Daily Nexus Instagram to gauge student perspectives on the RMP site. 52 students responded from varying majors and years.† On a scale of one to five, 84.6% of students marked the four (likely) and five (very likely) categories when assessing the likelihood of a professor's RMP quality rating affecting their decision to take a course. When assessing the RMP difficulty rating of a professor, 55.8% marked four and five. These results show that students value the quality rating of a professor over the difficulty when choosing courses. While a significant percentage of students weigh RMP ratings heavily when choosing courses, there is also a bias to take into account. Chitale said that the general ratings give you a basic sense of what the course is like, but there are confounding factors like the professor's teaching style, which could vary in preference among students. For example, if a professor does not use slides, some students who are visual learners may find his teaching of poor quality, while others enjoy the auditory focus of the course.†† ""If you just look at the score, then it's not going to be as helpful,""ù Chitale said. ""What I tend to do is I'll look at the bad reviews and see what exactly about the professor is bad.""ù† Other students, such as fifth-year writing major Chace Duma, share similar opinions about the effectiveness of the reviews on the site. ""I read over them just because some of them seem a little hyperbolic sometimes, but for the most part, I think the collective trend of all the reviews can be taken more than just like what an individual review says,""ù Duma said when asked about the genuineness of the reviews. Even though the site provides an additional lens into courses and professors, many students still have reservations about RMP or opinions as to how the site could improve user experience. Based on our interviews, some features that students suggested for RMP were ratings for teaching assistants (TAs) that lead sections and labs or filtering a professor through the courses they have taught. ""I don't know if that would really be super feasible, considering TAs will teach for a limited amount of time,""ù Chitale adds. What are the top positive and negative words used in ratings? Using Bing Liu's ""Opinion Lexicon,""ù ""î a list of words that indicate a positive or negative opinion ""î† the most common words for each category were isolated. The words ""easy""ù and ""hard""ù top the charts of their respective categories with ""easy""ù appearing over 10,000 times and ""hard""ù almost 8,000 times. Aside from those two descriptors, most of the common positive and negative words only appear less than 4,000 times, displaying a common trend towards the usage of ""easy""ù and ""hard.""ù Which departments have the highest number of reviews? Looking at the UCSB ratings for each department, the Department of Mathematics has the most reviews with over 5000. Almost all STEM majors offered at UCSB require at least one mathematics course in the major requirement. Additionally, the Area C General Education requirements make mathematics a common option for students to take. Among the top 10 most reviewed departments, there is an even number of STEM and humanities/social science departments.††† Conclusion Overall, RMP is a highly valuable site given to students in providing an additional layer of information when evaluating courses and professors. Although the reviews themselves are not a definitive evaluation of the course or professor, it provides a useful tool when students keep potential biases of the reviews in mind and seek additional advice from upperclassmen or the professor.†† Comments are closed.

data,Nexus explained: UC campus crime data from 2008-2016,8-Oct-22,9:22 PM,"['Siddharth Chattoraj', 'Christy Yu']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-08/nexus-explained-uc-campus-crime-data-from-2008-2016/,"Crime rates across the University of California rose between 2008 and 2016. Each campus tells a different story ""î from UC Santa Barbara's highest arrests in drunkenness to UC Los Angeles' highest rates in Part I FBI crimes, the Nexus analyzed the data here.† The Nexus acquired crime records from the University of California Police Department (UCPD) Annual Report and Crime Statistics site. The UCPD recorded crime data for the years 2008-2016 across all UC campuses. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Handbook sets the definition of each crime and which crimes fall under Part I and Part II classifications. Part I crimes are considered to be more serious than Part II crimes. Part I crimes are categorized into violent crimes and property crimes. Violent crimes include homicide, manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, while property crimes include burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft and arson.† The UCPD also records ""percent cleared""ù statistics, which is the percentage of crimes solved by the UCPD per type. This can be used to compare the success rates of each campus police department at identifying and arresting the responsible culprit. Since percentage cleared data was not reported in 2009, the article analyzes percentage cleared data from 2010-2016. According to the ""In this Report""ù section of the UCPD crime statistics website, if multiple crimes are committed at the same time, only the most serious crime would be reported. Nevertheless, arson was an exception ""î it is always reported since it ""frequently occurs in conjunction with other crimes reported in the UCR system.""ù† Discrepancies and Context The dataset has mathematical and classification errors, but they were not altered for the purposes of this article. The UCR Handbook, last updated in 2004, classifies aggravated assaults as Part I crimes and simple assaults as Part II crimes. However, the ""In this Report""ù page of the UCPD crime statistics site states that ""all assaults (both simple and aggravated)""ù are Part I crimes. From 2008-2012, the UCPD classified both simple and aggravated assaults as Part I crimes, but from 2013 onward, the UCPD changed its classification of simple assault crimes to fall under Part II crimes rather than Part I crimes. As simple assaults make up a large part of the dataset, the trends displayed in the charts below may be potentially inaccurate as a result of this misclassification.† The universitywide totals provided by the UCPD for each year and each crime classification rarely match the sum of the individual totals of a particular crime committed at each campus. This pattern continues throughout most of the dataset. Accordingly, for the purposes of this article, the Nexus used only the individual totals to display and analyze the data.† Taking the population into account helps contextualize the information. For example, in the Stolen vs. Recovered Property bar chart, the Recovered Property Value includes raw numbers but also shows the proportional value of the data. Additionally, some schools have smaller counts of crime than other schools but also have smaller populations. For example, UC Berkeley and UC Los Angeles (UCLA) annually have more arrests than other UC campuses but also have larger campus populations.† Source: University of California Information Center The population of each UC campus generally increased every year. UC Berkeley and UCLA had the highest population out of all UC campuses, while UC Merced and UC San Francisco had the lowest. While crimes committed by faculty or to faculty were also included in the crime counts, the majority of people arrested for crimes committed by the UC police departments were people not affiliated with a university, followed by students. Having more or less faculty was not associated with a higher or lower crime count. Some population totals were present on the UCPD reports but not all were cited each year. In order to have a standardized metric to analyze the effect of population on crime totals, the Nexus used student population data from the UC Information Center. The totals are similar to the reported population data in each police statistic report.† UCPD provides a disclaimer stating that assessments of the crime data can only be valid if they consider the unique conditions and factors that impact each campus police departments' jurisdictions.† ""The reader is, therefore, cautioned against comparing statistical data of individual reporting units from cities, metropolitan areas or universities solely on the basis of their population coverage or student enrollment,""ù the disclaimer reads.† ""We encourage the readers of the Annual Security & Fire Safety Report to use the information provided in this document as a guide for safe practices on and off campus,""ù Public Information Officer Sergeant Dan Wilson said in an email statement to the Nexus Analysis  Across all campuses in 2016, about 9.85% of arrests were in Part I and 71.36% in Part II. UC Berkeley follows a similar pattern, with 9.92% in Part I and 73.2% in Part II.†   UCLA, however, has a significantly higher Part I percentage ""î 23.91% ""î but a smaller Part II percentage, 49.22%. While UC Berkeley has a total of 77 Part I arrests, UCLA had 154. For Part II arrests, UC Berkeley had 568 and UCLA had 317.  UCSB has the highest Part II arrests of all UC campuses, with 999 arrests (92.33%) and 39 Part I arrests (3.60%). There were 302 arrests for drunkenness, which was the largest category under Part II, followed by liquor laws (271 arrests) as second largest and disorderly conduct (106 arrests) as third. Considering that UCSB has a much smaller population than UCLA and UC Berkeley, both the percentage and raw numbers are significantly high data points.   Among most UC campuses, Part I crime totals decreased from 2008-2016. Five UC campuses had significant spikes in Part I crimes committed in 2012 before a steep drop-off occurred in 2013. Either UC Berkeley or UCLA, the two campuses with the highest population totals, usually had the most Part I crimes committed in a given year; UC Merced, which had one of the lowest populations, had the least.† The UC campuses experienced significant difficulty clearing Part I crimes. With the exception of UC Merced, all campus police departments were unable to clear more than 20% of Part I crimes in a given year. UC Merced and UCLA regularly had the highest clearance rate among UC campuses, while UC Davis usually had the lowest. After reaching a high of 605 Part I crimes in 2009, UCSB's Part I crime total usually decreased each year until 2016, slightly rising to 336 crimes. The data shows that a larger campus population generally corresponded with a greater amount of Part I crimes committed, and UCSB's Part I crime totals fit that trend.† UCSB usually cleared a mid-to-high percentage of Part I crimes in a given year. Its 2016 percentage was 15%, a moderate rise from clearing 7% of Part I crimes in 2010.††   Across most UC campuses, the difference in Part II crime totals in 2016 compared to 2008 stayed relatively small. However, many of the campuses experienced steep fluctuations in crime totals with low and high amounts ranging from approximately 300 to 1,000 crimes.† The percentage of Part II crimes cleared per year in each UC campus also wavered heavily over the years. Only UC Davis had a large increase in the percentage of Part II crimes cleared in 2016 compared to 2010, whereas UC Santa Cruz's Part II crimes percentage cleared was significantly low, ranging between 16% and 27% from 2012-16. After experiencing a decrease in Part II crimes committed, UCSB saw a massive increase in Part II crimes committed, with a high of 1,456 occurring in 2015. Despite ranking seventh out of the 10 UC campuses in population, UCSB yearly had the third-highest amount of Part II crimes behind UC Berkeley and UCLA.† However, UCSB consistently had a higher percentage of Part II crimes cleared than other UC campuses. Its high of 91% cleared in 2014 and low of 74% cleared in 2012 are the greatest high and low Part II percentage clearance values of any UC campus. A larger amount of Part II crimes occurring at UCSB generally corresponded with a higher percentage cleared value. The data shows that the UCSB police consistently solve Part II crimes more than other campuses, despite the higher crime totals at UCSB.† †   From 2008-2016, UC campus police departments had significant trouble recovering stolen property value. With the exception of UC Riverside and UC Merced, each campus failed to record a single year where the property value recovered by the UC police was at least half of the stolen property value. On eight occasions, despite the stolen property value being in the mid-to-high hundred thousands, the respective campus police departments recovered less than $10,000 in property value. The value of the stolen property at UCSB first dropped below $200,000 in 2013, before dropping further to around $91,000 in 2014. By 2016, the stolen property value had risen to approximately $123,000. An average of $40,488 was recovered yearly at UCSB between 2008-2013, but an average of only $19,703 was recovered annually between 2014-16. Compared to the other UC campuses, UCSB usually had a relatively mid-to-low stolen property value. The UCSB campus police typically recovered the greatest proportion of property value. Ôªø The population totals used to calculate police ratios and arrest rates across the UC campuses were the data given for individual campuses by the UC police department, which included full population totals (undergraduate, graduate, staff, and faculty) from 2012-2016. There was little to no association between police ratio (officers per 1,000 people) and arrests per 1,000 people between 2012 and 2016 across the UC campuses.† UC campus police ratios scarcely changed over the years. UC San Francisco's police ratio was an outlier with around two officers per 1,000 people each year but had a steadily high arrest rate. UC Davis consistently had a lower police ratio and arrest rate compared to other campuses. With the exception of UC San Francisco in 2014, UC Berkeley in 2015 and UCSB from 2014-16, the arrest rate for each UC campus remained below 20 arrests per 1,000 people each year.† Despite its relatively low population and in-the-middle police ratio, UCSB had an abnormally high arrest rate each year compared to most other UC campuses. From 2012-13, UCSB's arrest rate per 1,000 people hovered at around 18, but from 2014-16 the arrest rate hovered between 30 to 45 arrests per 1,000 people. According to Wilson, a possible cause of the relatively high arrest rate is that the UCSB police department assists the sheriff in policing Isla Vista. As such, the department records crimes that occur both on campus and off campus in Isla Vista.† ""If Isla Vista is not included, the data for [UCSB] is in line with other campuses,""ù Wilson said. Wilson also believes that the high arrest rate could be due to UCSB's efforts to protect survivors. ""Another factor that could play a role in the data is that our campus also has robust programs in place to support survivors of interpersonal violence, including encouraging reporting which experts point out leads to higher crime numbers,""ù Wilson said. ""We are grateful to have a community that is committed to these kinds of programs and efforts in support of our students.""ù Overall, Part II crimes occurred more frequently than Part I crimes, and drunkenness was a major portion of Part II crimes occurring at UCSB. Part I crimes generally fell each year at UCSB, while Part II crimes usually increased annually. The UCSB police cleared Part II crimes and recovered stolen property value at a higher rate than most other campuses, but UC campuses as a whole struggled to recover stolen property. There was little to no association between police ratio and arrest rates among the campuses, and the UCSB police arrested a higher rate of people than the other campuses over the years.† ""UCPD will continue to partner with our student and community leaders on innovative safety strategies and crime reduction programs,""ù Wilson said. ""By collaborating with our community and sharing campus safety and security information, we aim to increase awareness and stimulate participation in this shared responsibility for maintaining a safe campus environment.""ù A version of this article appeared on pg. 6 and pg. 7 of the Oct. 6, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

data,Diwali Across the Globe,27-Oct-22,10:42 AM,['Siddharth Chattoraj'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-27/diwali-across-the-globe/,"Diwali is an annual, five-day festival that, according to a large number of people, commemorates the Hindu god Lord Rama's return to his kingdom of Ayodhya from a 14-year exile after conquering the demon god Ravana.† Per Hindu mythology, Rama's stepmother banished him and his wife Seeta to a forest so her own son could become king, and Ravana eventually took Seeta hostage. After 14 years, once Rama fought and finally killed Ravana and returned home with Seeta, the people of Ayodhya shared sweets and lit the path with a plethora of lamps said to outnumber the stars.† The celebration is also known as ""Deepavali""ù or the ""Festival of Lights""ù in symbolism of the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa), also known as diyas, that celebrators place outside to protect their homes from spiritual darkness.† According to popular belief, Lord Rama first worshipped Lord Ganesh, the remover of obstacles, and Goddess Laxmi, the goddess of prosperity, upon his return. As such, a tradition was born to worship those gods and conduct a Puja on Diwali night to celebrate the triumph of good over evil. That night is set on the 15th day of the month of Karthik (the darkest night of the Hindu lunisolar calendar) in India's calendar, a new moon day like the day Lord Rama returned. This year, Diwali night fell on Oct. 24.† Some others believe that Diwali commemorates the time Lord Krishna, who came to assist humanity in a time of great need, defeated the demon Narakasura who was terrorizing the Earth.† There is no universally agreed upon origin, and there are many different ideas on how Diwali started. The first day of Diwali, Dhanteras, is usually an auspicious day to buy metallic items and precious stones or jewelry for good luck and worship Lord Dhanvantari, who brought health and medicine to humans. Day two, Choti Diwali, celebrates the day Lord Krishna killed Narakasura's demon, freeing the world of its wrath. Day three is Lakshmi Puja when Ganesha and Lakshmi are worshipped. Day four is Govardhan Puja, where people commemorate the time Krishna lifted the Govardhan Hill to shelter a village from tremendous rains, symbolizing God's protection of his devotees. Day five is Bhai Dooj, which celebrates sibling love. Diwali is celebrated in many places across the globe with lights, jewelry, henna and rangoli art, fireworks, sweets, shopping, house cleaning and more, and it is an ever-growing tradition that over a billion people take part in. Many Hindus and some Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists celebrate the festival. Just recently, in fact, New York City declared Diwali to be a school holiday.† Here are some of the countries where Diwali is an officially recognized holiday. Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus Fiji Diwali, a public holiday in Fiji, is celebrated with many lit lamps, gift exchanges and cultural talks in English, Hindi and Fijian languages in a showing of communal harmony. Many schools in Fiji organize events, such as pujas, singing and rangoli, and incorporate the culture of the festival into the curriculum. Guyana Guyana has a large Hindu population, and many Guyanese Hindus and non-Hindus celebrate the national holiday. There is an annual Diwali motorcade on Diwali eve featuring bright lights, majestic floats and women emulating Hindu deities riding on chariots. The motorcade and Diwali celebrations are a symbol of unity and resilience in Guyana, and various people of different backgrounds come together to participate. India India, where Diwali originated, is marked by numerous festivities during Diwali week. Sweets and cultural outfits are in high demand, and many people burst firecrackers at night, which in turn causes large amounts of smog to clog up the air. The town of Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu has 640 factories that produce 90% of India's firecracker supply. Lamps are lit in houses and sent across river banks, special prayers are said to Lakshmi and markets buzz in celebration. Malaysia There are street bazaars in the Little India and Brickfields areas, where a large Indian community resides in Kuala Lumpur. There are public processions and fireworks displays. Many homes and buildings have kolam decorations, floor designs made from colored rice and powder thought to bring prosperity to homes. Mauritius During Diwali, the island turns bright with illuminated houses and an abundance of colorful garlands. Many of the Hindu temples in Mauritius conduct grand pujas. Additionally, home cooking is common, and people like to distribute homemade sweets to their loved ones. It is also summer in Mauritius during Diwali, and as such, there is a large market for new cultural outfits that both fit the Mauritian-Indian taste and are feasible in the heat. Myanmar Many participate in diya lighting festivities and prayers for everyone's happiness and well-being. There is traditional dancing and music along with sweets as people worship God and celebrate Diwali.† Nepal For Diwali, better known as Tihar in Nepal, people celebrate both the gods and animals. People pray to Lord Yama so that they may go to heaven, and they also worship and feed the animals because they are considered divine gifts from nature. Day one is reserved for worshipping the Crow (the messenger of Yama); day two for the Dog (for love, protection and a gate to heaven); day three for the Cow (for prosperity); day four for the ox (a farmer's best friend), Govardhan Mountain, and self-worship (for purity); and day five is for celebrating the love of siblings. Almost the entirety of Nepal participates in the festival, and many clean their houses and purchase new items, buy clay lamps and lots of lights, sweets, and rangoli colors for decorations. In Kathmandu, the Grand Tihar Festival lights up the city with lamps, firecrackers and cultural music and dance. Pakistan Diwali in Pakistan is an optional holiday ""î employees in Pakistan are granted one optional holiday if Muslim and three if non-Muslim in a calendar year. The rule is silent about private Pakistani establishments. Despite their tensions, it is tradition for Pakistani troops and Indian troops to exchange sweets and pleasantries at the border.† Singapore The Little India district puts up a lighting and flower display and a Diwali bazaar that brings together young and old people of different backgrounds into a lively, fun environment. A grand lighting of the lamp was held in September, and from then until the end of Diwali, five million people are expected to visit Little India.† Sri Lanka A lot of people, especially children, in Sri Lanka celebrate Diwali by bursting firecrackers. Diwali in Sri Lanka emphasizes more the victory of good over evil than Rama's victory over Ravana. Many Sri Lankans, particularly the Tamil Hindu population, say prayers and light oil lamps to mark the festival.†† Suriname Many people light oil lamps, clean their surroundings, light fireworks and celebrate Diwali together in Suriname. A large portion of people in the country are of Indian origin, descending from 19th-century contract workers. Trinidad and Tobago In Trinidad and Tobago, many celebrate with prayers, feasts and diya lighting ceremonies. Many Hindus and non-Hindus visit the Divali Nagar, meaning City of Lights, held by the National Council of Indian Culture. Approximately 150,000 people from across the Caribbean visit over the nine nights the Nagar is run for, and visitors can enjoy cultural performances, Indo-Trinidadian foods (e.g. pepper roti), educational activities, shopping and more.

data,"Analysis of the response to Munger Hall using Twitter, Reddit data",17-Nov-22,1:24 PM,"['Julia Ong', 'Grace Nunnelley']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-17/analysis-of-the-response-to-munger-hall-using-twitter-reddit-data/,"Introduction UC Santa Barbara's Munger Hall dormitory has been a point of contention since its announcement, initiating discussion in the local community on topics from the housing crisis to student mental health. In this article, the Daily Nexus Data Team takes a closer look into the data surrounding the online discourse of Munger Hall. A version of the dormitory ""î which began in private conversations between Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charles Munger and Chancellor Henry T. Yang ""î was first announced in a 2016 UC Regents meeting. The project would later be redesigned and reintroduced in 2021 under the name Munger Hall. The dorm seeks to fulfill UCSB's remaining obligations under the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), an agreement with the City of Goleta stating that the university would provide housing for an additional 5,000 students by 2025. Key events in the project's timeline that would likely initiate online discussion include a lawsuit brought against UCSB by the City of Goleta last November for failing to meet the requirements of the LRDP and the resignation of a consulting architect for Munger Hall last October. The Nexus recently published a feature on the history of housing planning in recent UCSB history with more details about the Munger Hall project. Methodology† To see how the online community was engaging with this topic, the Daily Nexus Data Team† analyzed the public response to the events relating to Munger Hall by scraping tweets and Reddit posts from 2009 to 2022. We used the Python library SNScrape to collect data pertinent to the media platform (e.g. dates, content, likes and subreddits), and another Python library, NLTK, for sentiment analysis. We collected around 2,000 tweets and 535 Reddit posts based on the term ""Munger Hall""ù, which includes references beyond UCSB. Twitter analysis  Grace Nunnelley / Daily Nexus The chart above tracks the frequency of tweets mentioning ""Munger Hall""ù over time. References to Munger Hall date as far back as 2009. We can also see that references to Munger Hall occur around March 24, 2016, when Munger announced his dormitory design at a University of California Board of Regents meeting. There was a large spike in tweets in late October after Dennis McFadden, a consulting architect for the dormitory, resigned from the project, making the project national news and fermenting an intense backlash against the design.† Stella Jia / Daily Nexus We used sentiment analysis to evaluate how negative, neutral, or positive people posting on Twitter feel about Munger Hall. Sentiment analysis evaluates each word in our collected Twitter data and assigns it a category of negative, neutral or positive. The pie chart displays that most posts are neutral. Between negative and positive language, 13% of the Twitter posts are negative leaning while 9% are positive leaning.† Reddit analysis Julia Ong / Daily Nexus Julia Ong / Daily Nexus Subreddits are niche forums within Reddit for people with shared interests to interact and have discussions. The chart above shows that the majority of mentions of Munger Hall were in the /r/UCSantaBarbara subreddit. Looking at the other top subreddits, we can see that Reddit users are discussing Munger Hall in the context of architecture and design. The subreddit /r/news is also among the top subreddits mentioning this topic, showing that Munger Hall is of interest to a wider community than just UCSB. Takeaways Discussion of Munger Hall was mainly driven by major developments in the project, especially McFadden's resignation last October. Although there is plenty of online discourse both praising and disparaging Munger Hall, most of the language sentiment seems to be neutral. Furthermore, while Munger Hall was most commonly mentioned on the /r/UCSantaBarbara subreddit, according to our analysis, there was plenty of discussion surrounding Munger Hall in the wider Reddit community.

data,To fund or not to fund: UCSB's competitive research environment,17-Nov-22,1:01 PM,"['Shannon Rumsey', 'Jessica Crum', 'John-Michael Kirchner']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-17/to-fund-or-not-to-fund-ucsbs-competitive-research-environment/,"Based on the Data Team's analysis of department funding, over $200 million are allocated to UC Santa Barbara research projects every year. The Daily Nexus Data Team analyzed research funding and discovered a skewed distribution among academic departments at UCSB.† Funding plays a crucial role in research and can be what determines whether or not a project moves forward in development. In order to acquire funding, individual departments must write a funding proposal that describes the purpose of its research, identifies potential sponsors and states the desired amount of funding, which is reviewed by either the UCSB Sponsored Project Office or the sponsor of the research grant.† UCSB's research funding statistics are categorized by either the home department, which is the department receiving the funds or the administrative department, which is the department the project's Principal Investigator belongs to.The Principal Investigator is the person in charge of ensuring the allocated funds are spent properly. For the purposes of this article, analysis was based primarily on the administrative department because it better reflects how individual departments utilize funding. Departments receiving no funding were not included in this analysis because many departments receive no research funding in a given year; thus, including the unfunded departments would skew the distribution. Funding for research primarily comes from California state agencies, nonprofits and federal agencies.  According to UCSB's Office of Research, the largest source of research funding UCSB receives is from federal sources such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.† When analyzing funding that departments receive, it is important to acknowledge that when applying for research funding, departments can, at times, only receive funding from sources that relate to their research.† NASA, for example, provided $5.7 million to UCSB research projects in 2021-22, but only funded proposals that correlated with their initiatives, according to the Guidebook for Proposers Responding to a NASA Funding Announcement. Research projects that are eligible to receive funding must fall into the Science, Human Exploration and Operations, Aeronautics Research and Space Technology categories. This proves to be an occasional barrier when seeking funding as some major sources are primarily allocated toward specific research endeavors.† Organized Research Units, which are home to interdisciplinary centers such as the Center for Evolutionary Psychology and the Ocean and Coastal Policy Center, provide the opportunity for research to operate outside of the established academic teaching departments at UCSB. They consistently received the most funding of all Colleges since 2016.† John-Michael Kirchner / Daily Nexus The ""Other""ù department, shown as the green line in the Total Funding per College for Administrative Department by Year chart, responsible for student resources such as the Student Health Service and UCSB Library, saw a significant increase in funding from 2019-21 as a result of needing to procure additional resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in which Congress passed the CARES Act in part to provide funds to universities to support campus operations during the pandemic, according to the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund quarterly report.† It is important to note that these additional funds did not prevent potential funding for other projects or take funding from other departments. John-Michael Kirchner / Daily Nexus John-Michael Kirchner / Daily Nexus For the 2021-22 fiscal year, the physics and engineering departments received the highest proportion of funding of the overall $241.5 million in total funding for the year. The top 10 most funded departments received 57% of the total research funds available, and the 10 least funded departments received just 0.13% of the total research funding budget. On average, the College of Engineering, which comprises only five undergraduate majors, received a total of about 33% of all research funding available for the fiscal years of 2017-22. The physics department alone received approximately 6% of funding available in the last five years. It is also interesting to note that of the six Nobel Prizes awarded to faculty and alumni associated with UCSB, five are in the College of Engineering or the physics department.† As a comparison, the combined 10 least funded departments have received on average just 0.1% of the yearly research funding since 2017. The Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies have been in the bottom 10 since 2017 in terms of allocated research funding, receiving just 0.01% of yearly research funding on average. That equates to about 600 times less than the physics department, one of the consistently highest awarded in terms of funding. Claudio Campagnari, professor and department chair for the physics department, said that physics faculty members, either individually or in collaboration, apply for funding and are generally successful. The Electrical and Computer Engineering, Spanish and Portuguese, Economics and Communications departments did not respond to requests for comment.† Research funding also supports graduate students in terms of tuition and benefits and gives undergraduates the opportunity to work in labs to gain research experience, Campagnari said.† ""There are no barriers to gaining research funding, except that the total amount of funding available in the United States is not infinite, and it is a very competitive environment,""ù Campagnari said in an email statement.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 17, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

data,El Congreso sends direct letter to Chancellor to address demands,20-Nov-22,7:16 PM,['Asumi Shuda'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-20/el-congreso-sends-direct-letter-to-chancellor-to-address-demands/,"El Congreso de UC Santa Barbara delivered a direct letter to Chancellor Henry T. Yang following a lack of administrative action on their April demands to expand El Centro and halt the Munger Hall project, giving the chancellor until Nov. 14 to provide a response.† El Congreso submitted a list of demands to Chancellor Henry Yang calling for him to halt the Munger Hall housing project and expand El Centro. Liam Goodin / Daily Nexus El Congreso ""î a Chicanx organization that works to support and uplift marginalized students on campus ""î published its initial list of demands on Apr. 28 and presented the list to university administrators and Yang in a May 4 meeting. While UCSB administration responded to some of the demands, El Congreso received minimal response during the meeting regarding the two primary demands of concern in the letter, according to fourth-year political science major and El Congreso member Isa Medrano. El Congreso received a response from Yang on Nov 14. regarding the demands, but Medrano said the organization found his email insufficient and lacking substantial plans to tangibly begin addressing these two demands by the administration.† ""We appreciate how important El Centro is to our campus community, and we look forward to working with students, faculty and staff on planning for an expansion and creating additional space,""ù Yang said in an email response to El Congreso. The organization still considers its demands unmet and is anticipating further action to ensure its completion. However, the timeline for such action remains unsure, as El Congreso does not want to disrupt the current higher education strike, Medrano said.† El Congreso called for the physical expansion of the El Centro building, asking for the construction of more study spaces and community rooms, as well as an assessment of the surrounding area for building expansion. El Centro de UCSB is a communal building located on campus in Building 406 as a physical and historical space for numerous multicultural, Chicanx/Latinx and political organizations, including El Congreso.† ""You have referred to El Centro more than once as a place you consider home, or as your favorite space on campus, yet when we discussed this demand in our May 4th meeting, you made no clear or firm commitment to meet this demand,""ù El Congreso's letter to Yang read.† In a Nov. 15 email statement to the Nexus, Yang reiterated the importance of El Centro and said the administration is in the process of hiring a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) director.† ""El Centro is important to our campus community and we look forward to working with our students, faculty, and staff on planning for an expansion of El Centro to create additional space,""ù Yang said in the email. ""The Committee has been asked to conduct an in-depth exploration and start the planning process for a new HSI Director position.""ù El Congreso is also demanding a total halt to the Munger Hall project, citing concern with its current design plan ""î from the building's scale to the virtual windows ""î and the consequences its prospective residents would face. The organization also took issue with the building being the vision of a ""petulant billionaire""ù ""î referring to Charles Munger ""î and demanded the university to seek alternative housing plans.† ""We expect a statement from you directly that puts an end to this plan and commits to pursuing alternative housing development plans, otherwise, we consider this demand unmet,""ù the letter read.† Medrano said the meeting with Yang and the administration on May 4 did not produce any tangible actions or results regarding El Centro and Munger Hall and noted the silence from Yang, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn and the rest of the administrative body in the room when the issues were brought up.† ""The silence was the most deafening on these two, but it also became the most clear that on these two, we were not going to have any solid plans or anything reliable to move with if it was not from the Chancellor's mouth directly,""ù Medrano said.† Yang said to the Nexus that UCSB is continuing to solicit feedback on the project and recognized the housing shortage in the community in regards to Munger Hall. ""We are grateful for the thoughtful concerns that have been raised by El Congreso as well as from many of our students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members,""ù Yang said. ""Housing is a critical need for our campus, and community engagement is an important part of the process that we are undertaking to address this need.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Nov. 17, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.†

data,"UCSB men's basketball off to blazing hot start with high-powered offense, although attendance continues to drop",12-Jan-23,10:12 PM,"['Jake Jensema', 'Tahsin Azad', 'Malay Patel']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-12/ucsb-mens-basketball-off-to-blazing-hot-start-with-high-powered-offense-although-attendance-continues-to-drop/,"The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team has secured 8 wins out of their first 10 games, launching the 2022-23 season off to a great start. With four out of five starters returning and earning the best record out of their conference so far, the roster is looking strong and has hopes to return to March Madness, the National Collegiate Athletic Association's postseason basketball tournament. Context Common measures that basketball statisticians use to analyze the basic level of how good a team or player is at scoring are 2P%, 3P%, FG%, PPG and PTS. 2P%, or 2-point percentage, is the percentage of shots made that count for 2 points. 3P%, or 3-point percentage, is the percentage of shots made behind the 3-point line. If a player shoots 5 two-point shots in a game and makes 3 two-point shots, his 2P% is 60%. If a player shoots 5 three-pointers in a game and makes 2 two-point shots, his 3P% is 40%.† FG%, or field goal percentage, is the total percentage of 2-point and 3-point shots made. To calculate a player's FG%, divide the total number of shots made by the total number of shots taken. For example, if a player took 10 shots, and made 3 two-point shots and 2 three-point shots, their FG% is 50%. PPG, or points per game, is the average amount of points a single player scores per game. PTS, or points, is the total amount of points scored by the whole team or an individual player at the end of the game. Team and player statistics Offense has been a strong point for the Gauchos in recent years. The Gauchos led the Big West Conference in the 2021-22 season with a 49.4 FG%, which is very efficient. Compared to all the Division 1 teams across the country, the Gauchos ranked third in FG% as a team. The Gauchos also were tied for the highest average PTS per game with California State University Long Beach, both averaging 73.8 PTS per game. Looking at one of the best men's basketball conferences, the Big 12, the average score in conference matchups was 70.41 points per game. Thus, showing that the Gauchos were on par with some of the best teams in the country last year.†  Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus  Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus Analyzing the 2022-23 season compared to last year, the statistics are very similar to the prior year. However, since the season is only a third of the way finished, these numbers may level out throughout the season when conference games start on Dec. 29.† Looking at the players who contribute to this high-powered offense, we can pinpoint who the main offensive weapons are for the Gauchos this season.  Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus In previous seasons, there are one or two ""star""ù scorers who have a much higher PPG than the rest of their team. After the stars, we expect to see an exponential drop-off in scoring. In the 2021-22 season, forward Amadou Sow averaged 15.6 PPG, which meant Sow was accounting for 20.5% of his team's average 76 PTS per game in the 2021-22 season.† The next highest scorer, guard Ajay Mitchell, averaged 11.6 PPG, which accounted for 15.2% of the Gauchos' average 76 PTS per game. These two players accounted for 35.7% of the Gauchos' points every game. This is a huge chunk, with the rest of the 48.8 points coming from six to seven players on the roster. The big stars this season are third-year starters, forward Miles Norris and Mitchell. Norris is off to a great start this season increasing his scoring from 10.3 to 13.1 PPG, while Mitchell has become the new lead scorer for the Gauchos this year, improving his scoring from 11.6 to 14.7 PPG.† Both Norris and Mitchell have improved their scoring by 27% from last year. These two big offensive stars will definitely be interesting to follow as the season continues. As of Dec. 18, the Gauchos have a record of 8-2, the best record in the Big West.† Attendance trends and predictions Over the past 10 years, attendance at UCSB men's basketball games has been slowly declining. Attendance has diminished by more than 50%, from averaging almost 2,900 fans during the 2011-12 season to a low of 1,260 last year, the lowest average turnout in recorded history.† There was no data during the 2020-21 season due to COVID-19. The season still took place, but fans were not allowed to attend. So far, for the 2022-23 season, data for attendance hasn't been logged for every game. At the seven games where attendance was recorded, turnouts have been relatively low, at an average of around 722.  Malay Patel / Daily Nexus Coaching and team record statistics It has been five seasons since Joe Pasternack took on the role of head coach for the UCSB men's basketball team, and the Gauchos have become a dominant force in the Big West Conference. The team has since gone on to win both the Big West regular season championship and the Big West Conference tournament in 2021, and was also able to make an appearance in March Madness. Prior to Pasternack taking on the role, the Gauchos had undergone a terrible year in the 2016-17 season. At ninth place in the Big West and with 6 wins out of 28 games, the Gauchos had a disastrous season. Afterward, coach Bob Williams, who had served as the coach for almost 20 years, was fired.† In March 2017, Pasternack was hired as the head coach and was given just a few months to improve this team before the next season. In just one season, Pasternack took the team to win 23 games out of 32, which was the most wins of any UCSB men's basketball team coach's first season. When asked about this incredible first season, Pasternack refers to a procedure he calls, ""Our Process.""ù This follows a disciplined and focused lifestyle: waking up early, staying on top of hygiene, not skipping any classes, scoring high grades, eating a healthy lunch, practicing basketball daily, sleeping early and repeating this firm routine.  Tahsin Azad / Daily Nexus After the establishment of ""The Process,""ù the Gauchos have been consistently scoring above 70 points per game, on average, for the past five seasons. This is in addition to having, on average, more assists and a higher field goal percentage.† Defensively, under Pasternack, the Gauchos have had fewer turnovers and more steals compared to the seasons previous to his hiring, and have held their opponents to fewer points. Pasternack credits the student fans and the student body for these great changes and accomplishments.† Pasternack is proud of the work that he and his team have accomplished. ""We really want to make our home court a dominant powerhouse in the Big West. We're actively working with the student body to get more students attending our games, offering things like giveaways,""ù he said.† The Gauchos have not just improved in the season, but also in the conference standings. The team won more games under Pasternack on average than before and consistently scored more points than their opponents on average. The team also has been able to hold their opponents to fewer points in the conference.  Tahsin Azad / Daily Nexus The 2020-21 season was when the Gauchos, under Pasternack, had their greatest success. They won the Big West regular season championship, placing first on the standings, and the Big West Conference championship. They had the best win-loss ratio that the Gauchos have ever had and Pasternack was awarded the Big West Coach of the Year. The Gauchos won all 11 home games.† When asked about this outstanding season, Pasternack uses one word: ""Sacrifice.""ù He recalled how many players had to sacrifice their roles or individual statistics for the good of the team, and how they stayed strict and disciplined due to and during the threat of COVID-19.† He further describes how the more senior players were dead set on winning. Having gone three long years without any success, these players wanted a win more than anything, especially since this would be their last season for the Gauchos. The graph below shows the Gauchos' win rate based on the coach. Pasternack has the best win rate at 70.0%, which is 15.4% above the next-best win rate. Ôªø Tahsin Azad / Daily Nexus Following the successful 2020-21 season, the Gauchos declined in their performance, landing in fifth place in the Big West standings. Pasternack faults the five games canceled due to COVID-19, four of which were home games. Moreover, players on the team suffered many injuries. He believes these circumstances outside of their control disrupted their performance. Despite these hard times, Pasternack believes the future of UCSB men's basketball is a bright one but knows it is essential that UCSB students do their part: coming to games and showing their full support to the team. ""We need the support of the students. We need our home court to be the best in the Big West,""ù he said.

With a minimum 3.0 GPA, CSCAA selects collegiate teams for CSCAA's Scholar All-America, an honorary award for not only the swim team but also the university.† Since 2012, the high GPAs of the UCSB women's swim team have allowed them to be selected as a Scholar All-America Team, which is awarded after each fall and winter quarter. The team's GPAs are shown in Figure 1.† Michelle Tekawy / Daily Nexus Figure 1 *Some bars are left empty to represent unavailable data for that year or quarter. Data from Spring Quarter 2022 is not studied in this article since collegiate swimming is not in season during this quarter. Analyzing the bar graph in Figure 1, there is a positive increase in the team's GPA for both quarters over the last 10 years.† In the 2012-13 school year, the Gaucho women originally finished their fall quarter with an average GPA slightly above 3.0, but in the 2020-21 school year, they were able to set a record-high average GPA of 3.62 in the winter.† Another finding from the data is that the team tends to have a higher average GPA in the winter than in the fall. Although some quarterly GPAs were not published in earlier years, it is still evident that there is a significant rise throughout the years.† Michelle Tekawy / Daily Nexus Figure 2 *Data is empty for the years 2014-2015 since it is not given in the source. The bar graph in Figure 2 shows the gradual growth of the Gaucho women's GPA. This pattern follows the trend from Figure 1, since both their fall and winter quarter GPAs were increasing every school year.† In the 2012-13 school year, the UCSB women's swim team finished the year with a 3.05 GPA. Over nine school years, the team managed to improve their annual GPA by 0.495, hitting a 3.545 annual GPA in the 2021-22 school year. The overall average GPA from the nine recorded years is 3.29.† The greatest change in annual GPA number occurred between the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school year, when the Gaucho women bumped up their GPA by 0.165. That is why the bar graph shows a slight upward curving trend during those years. Michelle Tekawy / Daily Nexus Figure 3 Figure 3 depicts the average change in GPA of the team. Note that the GPA change from the previous year on the graph is positive, meaning the team's GPA has been increasing every year. For example, the GPA in the 2013-14 school year increased by 0.075 from the 2012-13 school year. The cumulative GPA change over the 10 years is the area under the curve of Figure 3. The total cumulative change is roughly 0.50 improvement over the years. The COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in online school for the end of the 2019-20 school year and the entirety of the 2020-21 year, influenced the year inside and outside of school.† ""Not being able to talk to my professors face to face or have discussions with my classmates made me feel lost at times,""ù said Gillian Flath, senior member and co-team captain of the UCSB women's swim team. ""It was sometimes difficult to stay engaged over Zoom.""ù† Mark Stori, a UCSB women's swimming assistant coach, emphasized the team's ability to adapt to the challenges presented by COVID-19. ""[The athletes] had to learn to adapt to Zoom and not having a set schedule for classes and studying,""ù Stori said. ""Creating a set schedule for classes and staying on top of their assignments took some time to master.""ù Interestingly enough, all three figures show how the year 2020 actually made the biggest conspicuous spike from its previous year compared to the other school years for the swimmers. In Figure 1, the winter quarter GPA was raised by 0.23, from the 2019-20 year. Similarly, the Fall Quarter 2020 GPA was 0.25 higher than the Fall Quarter 2019.† Regarding the GPA change from the prior year as shown in Figure 3, the Gauchos' GPAs increased by 0.165 from the 2019-20 year.† When in season, the Gaucho women have to dedicate up to 20 hours in their weekly schedule for practices, in addition to traveling for swim meets or community work.† The long hours make it harder for the swimmers to spend time studying for their classes. Reagan Nibarger, junior member and co-team captain, admitted† how the rigorous hours of training makes classes more difficult, saying, ""Taking hard courses can be super challenging when you are training 20 plus hours a week and traveling on the weekend.""ù† However, even though† in-person lectures, TA sessions, office hours, classroom engagements and resources, such as the library and CLAS, were no longer available for the athletes due to quarantine laws, the COVID-19 pandemic gave the swimmers time away from the pool to really focus on school work. This meant the Gauchos no longer needed to spend their 20 hours on swimming-related purposes. ""Not having long hours of practice helped me feel like I had more time to do things outside of swimming,""ù Flath stated. †It can be said that this allowed the swim team to excel in their remote classes and achieve a high 3.62 GPA for Winter Quarter 2020.† The team GPAs are mostly higher in the winter quarter relative to the fall, which can be explained by the layout of the collegiate swim season. During the winter quarter, the team competes throughout all of January and half of February. Swimming is mainly considered a winter sport, as more dual and championship meets take place over those busy one and a half months.† As such, the Gauchos pick their winter classes carefully, typically aiming for fewer classes (but still meeting NCAA's 12-unit requirement), and also easier, more flexible ones. This strategy allows the swimmers to have more time for competitions and training, as well as a more lenient schedule to reduce academic stress. ""Winter quarter is a little more stressful than fall quarter as [the swim team is] traveling more and getting ready for our conference meet in the middle of February, so the quarter seems to fly by,""ù Nibarger said. To explain the GPA improvements as a whole, coaches continue to emphasize academics by requiring study hall hours for their swimmers. Swimmers are required to work and study at the Intercollegiate Athletics (ICA) building's study hall for at least eight hours a week for freshmen, and a given number of hours for returners that have a GPA below 3.0 in their previous quarter.† By doing this, the women's swim team has both time and access to an optimal study environment. In addition, having new academic advisors that enforce good grades over the last couple of years has allowed the team to seek advice and plan out their classes and academic careers while also being successful in the water.† ""The athletic department has been super helpful with helping all the student athletes stay on top of their GPAs, workload and relationships with their teachers all while being communicative with their coaches,""ù Nibarger said. In addition to the athletic department's support for the athletes, there's a strong dynamic between upper- and lowerclassmen when seeking academic assistance and advice. ""The older swimmers will offer advice to younger swimmers on how to manage their time better,""ù Stori said. ""By their sophomore year, swimmers learn how to balance school and swim.""ù Overall, the UCSB women's swim team has made significant progress with their GPAs. Collegiate swimming requires a lot of time and sacrifice, being that they are in-season during both the fall and winter quarters. Regardless, the Gauchos have shown that they could maintain good grades and continue raising their quarterly and annual GPAs within the last 10 years. While there is still room for growth, the team is excited to continue to improve their GPAs and earn the title of a Scholar All-America team.

data,Keeping up with the UC labor strike: a UCSB social media sentiment analysis,16-Feb-23,9:30 AM,"['Samantha Su', 'Siddharth Chattoraj', 'Adil Ahmed']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-16/keeping-up-with-the-uc-labor-strike-a-ucsb-social-media-sentiment-analysis/,"As three unions within the University of California led the largest labor strike in United States higher-education history during November and December 2022, the topic of the strike occupied many social media platforms, namely Discord, Reddit and Twitter.† The Daily Nexus data team used DiscordChatExporter, PRAW and SNScrape to scrape 196 Discord posts from the UC Santa Barbara Discord, 876 Reddit posts and replies from r/UCSantaBarbara and 759 Twitter posts that discuss the strike at UCSB between Nov. 7 and Dec. 25, 2022. The data team used the NLTK Vader tool to analyze whether the social media sentiment about the strike was negative, positive or neutral. For the purposes of this article, ""posts""ù refers to both the original postings, comments and replies.† Teaching assistants, postdoctoral scholars and academic and graduate student researchers across the 10 University of California (UC) campuses voted between Oct. 26 and Nov. 2 to strike over alleged unfair labor practices committed by the UC. The three unions that represent the graduate student workers ""î Student Researchers United, United Auto Workers (UAW) 5810 and UAW 2865 ""î officially started striking on Nov. 14.† Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus Postdoctoral scholars and academic researchers ratified their new contracts on Dec. 9, and after six weeks of striking, graduate student researchers and teaching assistants approved their new contracts on Dec. 23. During the strike, social media was widely used by graduate students, undergraduates, faculty, administration and the general public to disseminate information and discourse on the historic event. Due to the nature of strikes requiring private discussion and negotiation among union members and the University of California, the sampled social media discourse may not be representative of UCSB students at large.† Liam Loberg, a second-year economics and accounting major who occasionally uses social media such as Reddit but rarely posts about hot-topic issues such as the strike, explained in a statement to the Nexus that, ""I would like to support, but the energy needed to stay active with activism and post is not for me; it's a lot of social energy.† ""As a student, I have one main focus: my academics. Everything else is secondary,""ù he said. While many UCSB students may refrain from posting, during the first week of the strike, there was significant discussion on all three social media platforms. The number of conversations was lower, but all platforms were still moderately active in all other weeks except for the week of Dec. 5. On Dec. 6, strikers at UCSB blocked parking lots in the morning as undergraduates were attempting to get to their finals. The blocked parking lots contributed to a spike in debate on Reddit.† Loberg first heard about the parking lot blockage on Reddit, which operated as a source of information about the strike for some UCSB students. Despite claiming to be in support of the strike the entire time regardless, he said he became very disappointed by striker activities. ""I heard that students were blocked from parking during finals; that wasn't the point of the strike at all. The strike was meant to cause disruption and bring light to a situation. It certainly was not meant to harm student activities,""ù Loberg said. Since r/UCSantaBarbara and Twitter are larger communities than the UCSB Discord server, they consequently saw more posts about the strike. There was significant interest in the strike during its first week, and the amount of Reddit posts spiked during the week of Dec. 5, largely due to emotions arising from the strikers blocking parking lots. As the strike reached its conclusion, activity on social media died down. (Samantha Su / Daily Nexus) Daniel Naylor, a second-year mathematics major in the College of Creative Studies who goes by ""Dan Le Man 2""ù on many of the UCSB-affiliated Discord servers, also had shifting sentiments on the strike, but in the opposite direction.† Naylor said in a statement to the Nexus that he first had an unfavorable view toward the strike, since he believed ""public sector unions are organizations designed to secure better compensations from the public.""ù However, according to Naylor, his outlook on the strike shifted when he realized ""how terribly the school was allocating its funds,""ù pointing to Chancellor Henry T. Yang's salary, which is currently $451,362 and will rise to $579,750 by March, as an example. While most posts on Discord were neutral, the sentiment of posts increased in positivity until the week of Nov. 28 before trending in the negative direction. Most Twitter posts were either positive or neutral, and the sentiment fluctuated each week. Beginning the week of Dec. 12, there was a slight increase in negative sentiment on Twitter. Until that week, in contrast to the Discord and Twitter sentiments, most Reddit posts were either positive or negative. Up until the week of Nov. 21, the Reddit sentiment leaned positive. Afterward, the Reddit sentiment generally leaned negative, until the union began to ratify their new agreements, which caused the sentiment to become more neutral. (Samantha Su, Siddharth Chattoraj, Adil Ahmed / Daily Nexus) Joel Pion, a graduate teaching assistant at UCSB studying mathematics, described in an email statement the importance of unity amid a strike.† ""The strike wouldn't have happened if all the sentiment had been either positive or negative,""ù he said. ""Strikes only can work if a critical mass of people participates. It is a collective action, and I don't think there can be truly neutral bystanders.""ù Tanzil Chowdhury, a third-year doctoral candidate and a head steward and bargaining team member representing UC Berkeley for UAW 2865, used Twitter as one method of communication to convey information about the strike to other graduate students and members of the greater community. UC Berkeley head steward and bargaining team member Tanzil Chowdhury used Twitter as a method to communicate information about the strike with his constituents and the greater community. Chowdhury said his job as a head steward is to help his fellow graduate students organize and fight for their rights. ""I understand that folks look to me for direction and that, for some people, my words holds some extra weight,""ù he said in a statement to the Nexus.† As such, Chowdhury said he posted information on Twitter, along with other social media platforms, with the goal of reaching as many people as possible. Some of his tweets gained thousands of views, and as the strike went on, he said he slightly cleared up his method of communication because it was crucial to the strike efforts. However, Chowdhury says that the conversations that he believed were most productive and impactful were those that did not occur publicly over social media. ""I think social media has a way of bringing out some of the least productive elements of communication and raising the temperature more than is justified, so I kept that in mind while interacting on here,""ù he said. ""The most fruitful communications were those done in person, one on one or in small groups. Those conversations had a lot more weight to me.""ù Conversations on the UCSB Discord server ""î taking place primarily between UCSB students ""î about the strike consisted mostly of short messages on a variety of areas, including striker actions, personal opinions, shared experiences and information sharing. Conversations about the strike on Discord were often mixed with other discussions. Most conversations were short and contained casual language and slang. Discussions about the strike would often be interwoven into other conversations, and users would frequently type multiple short messages in a row to convey their idea. Several users who frequently discussed the strike over multiple weeks on the UCSB Discord server did not respond to requests for comment. John Caldwell, a fourth-year film and media studies major, made a Reddit post asking, ""What happened to the strike not effecting the undergrads lmao? Kinda beginning to lose my sympathy when all of this is coming direct conflict w the continuation of my academic and degree.""ù Caldwell expressed frustration at canceled class sections and potentially not receiving grades in time for graduation while still paying full tuition. Caldwell posted his frustration about the strike on Reddit. Caldwell explained in a statement to the Nexus that he, like many other UCSB students, only sees Reddit as a go-to medium for whenever he needs a quick laugh. However, once his frustration had reached a breaking point, he turned to Reddit ""î relying on its accessibility ""î to publicly display his exasperation.† While Caldwell states that he has always been on the side of the strikers because they are severely underpaid for their work, ""My rage at the time of the strike to what was happening to me and my peers as a result of the strike is what led me to make the post in the first place,""ù he said. In response, many Reddit users tried deconstructing his post and offered him a different perspective: the strike was a crucial step for strikers to fight against unfair labor practices and receive a living wage.† As a result of his post, Caldwell was met with many users attempting to teach him about the benefits of striking. ""People often tried breaking down to me why the strike was happening and I had to repeat myself time after time because I knew why the strike was happening and was honestly shocked to see how many people were okay with being walked over,""ù Caldwell said.† Reddit was used as a mass communication link between undergraduate and graduate students, according to Kristen Thomas-McGill, a doctoral candidate in history and teaching assistant who frequently posted about the strike on Reddit to actively inform students about strike updates and to answer general questions. ""[Reddit] allows for both long-form posts with links and bullet points and direct responses to Redditor comments. This allowed us to provide general information to large numbers of Redditors in the text of posts while also addressing specific Redditors' concerns in the comments,""ù Thomas-McGill said in an email statement to the Nexus. Aside from the content of the posts, Thomas-McGill also explained that another informative method strikers used to determine general feedback on the strike was the upvote-downvote system. ""Upvotes can indicate enthusiasm about a particular topic, so when Redditors gave our informational posts, upvotes well into the three digits. It not only ensured that our information reached the top of the subreddit, but also indicated to users that there was a community of people interested in the strike,""ù she said. ""Frankly, Reddit raised hype about the strike. Downvotes, too, are important indicators because they're an unambiguous expression of displeasure.""ù† During the strike period, four of the top five Reddit original posts by the upvote-downvote score and the top five most-commented-on Reddit original posts were about the strike, displayed in orange. The score is the number of downvotes subtracted from the number of upvotes. Scores are accurate as of Jan. 22, 2023. (Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus) Discord, Reddit and Twitter are populated by different audiences and thus all receive different inputs. When asked about the differences between social media platforms, Thomas-McGill explained that Twitter was a more public platform than Reddit or Discord, since users across the globe could access strike-related tweets through hashtags and retweets easily. In comparison, most posts on Reddit were of positive sentiment toward the strike, while most posts on Twitter and Discord were of neutral sentiment. However, Twitter posts leaned positive while Discord posts leaned negative. (Samantha Su / Daily Nexus) ""I suspect that the responses from Twitter users will include proportionally more feedback from non-UC people than Reddit or Discord,""ù she said. Even still, Thomas-McGill explained that engagement with the topic of the strike across social media platforms, regardless of what affiliation it may come from, was a massive morale boost. ""The strike and our labor conditions are not just UC issues but community issues,""ù she said.

data,"From Sinzenich to Santa Barbara, Leroy Zeller's international student-athlete journey",9-Mar-23,5:09 PM,['Lucas Webster'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-09/from-sinzenich-to-santa-barbara-leroy-zellers-international-student-athlete-journey/,"Attend any UC Santa Barbara men's soccer game, and the name you will hear the most is Leroy Zeller. His name is chanted at nearly every game, fans ask for pictures after and strikers fear him. Zeller, a third-year global studies major who won Co-Goalkeeper of the Year for the Big West Conference in the 2022-23 season took the Gauchos to a conference final.† Zeller lifting the 2021 Big West Conference Trophy (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) Growing up in Sinzenich, Germany, Zeller began his soccer career at only four years old as an outfield player. According to Zeller, he tried his hand at goalkeeping at 12 years old, and it stuck. Viktoria K√∂ln, a nearby 3rd division soccer club, took notice of his abilities, and recruited him to play for their under-17s (u17) side. At 16, Zeller sought to advance his career more rapidly, so he moved out of his childhood home to play for a new club called Greuther F√ºrth, a second division side in the south of Germany who offered him a chance to play u19 soccer. Zeller said that after successful performances for the club's second team, he began to train with the first team, but his appendix burst after a couple strong months training at the higher level. After being sidelined due to his hospital stay and recovery period, he was not offered a new contract due to the extent of time he spent off the field. During this time, Zeller said that the German soccer transfer window closed, so he decided to set his sights abroad. He began training with Barnsley F.C., a club in England's second division, but after a couple months, Zeller felt a better opportunity lay overseas in America. Zeller felt that he had better opportunities in America because he was able to be a student and an athlete. In Europe, it is common for soccer players to focus solely on their athletic careers. According to Zeller, Europe's lack of a fail-safe for young soccer players led him to consider American college soccer. As a European athlete, Zeller really appreciated how ""you can study, get your major, do something productive""ù and still be able to pursue soccer. In 2019, Zeller moved to South Carolina to play Division II soccer for Newberry College on a full ride scholarship. Coming in, he had plans of transferring to a Division I program after his first year, but when the COVID-19 pandemic began, the next fall soccer season was canceled and his plans were stunted. When sports were able to resume during the 2020-21 school year, it was football season, and Zeller was interested.† ""I was always fascinated by the sport and the athletes playing in the NFL. I am always looking forward to learning new things and facing challenges,""ù Zeller said.† Zeller was good friends with a few of the starting football players at Newberry. His friends trained Zeller to be a wide receiver in just a few months. The head football coach took notice of his skills, and invited him to train with the team. He completed a full pre-season with the team, and at the end of pre-season he was offered a full-ride scholarship to play football. With two full-ride scholarships on the table for both soccer and football, he began to weigh his future in the two sports. Zeller was leaning towards football, but sent out emails to soccer coaches across the nation, in accordance with the original plan he came to Newberry College with. If the right offer came, he would take it. A day later, UCSB replied expressing interest, and Zeller said he ""directly went to UCSB, and everything else is history from there.""ù When asked ""why UCSB?""ù he responded, ""The program, the program, the program.""ù†† Zeller said he admires the soccer history, the location and the lack of American football at UCSB.† ""Soccer is the biggest thing here,""ù he said. Soccer being central to UCSB was crucial to Zeller, and soon Zeller too became crucial to UCSB soccer.† During the 2021-22 season and Zeller's first season with the Gauchos, he had an 80.4% save rate for every game he played. Zeller's save percentage is higher than UCSB's last seven seasons of starting goalkeepers.† In the 2021-22 season, Zeller had the highest save percentage of any UCSB goalkeeper since 2013, and the team also had its highest win percentage since 2013 that same season. Zeller is also only the second goalkeeper since 2013 to play two seasons as a starter. A general correlation between starting goalkeeper save percentage and team win percentage is present. The average save percentage across the data points is 75.07%, and the average win percentage is 61.42%. (Lucas Webster / Daily Nexus) Zeller's statistics took the Gauchos to a conference championship during the 2021-2022,† He, however, fell short of taking home the coveted Big West Goalkeeper of the year award as it went to UC Irvine's Gordon Botterill. Botterill's win motivated Zeller.† ""What I did good last year, I improved, and what I didn't do well last year, I worked really hard on,""ù he said. The goals he set for himself were reflected in his play time. Zeller achieved a 78.8% save percentage and only conceded 1 goal per game on average across the 20 games he played. His identical pre-playoff numbers were enough to warrant him winning co-goalkeeper of the Year of the Big West.† Zeller had the second highest overall save percentage out of all goalkeepers in overall games in the Big West Conference during the 2022-23 men's soccer season. Zeller had a 78.8% save percentage, while the overall conference average was 72.02%. (Lucas Webster / Daily Nexus) Zeller had the second lowest average goals conceded during the 2022-23 Big West Conference season. Zeller held a one goal conceded per game average, and the conference average was 1.33 goals conceded per game. (Lucas Webster / Daily Nexus) Zeller attributed his success to his goalkeeper coach, David Elias.† ""Goalkeeper to goalkeeper coach connection is really important in soccer, because that's the guy you work with every day. He's the guy who follows you into games and has your back when something is not going well,""ù Zeller said. Zeller also said that his pre-game ritual helped improve his performance. Before every game, Zeller makes a goal to not concede a goal, also known as a clean sheet .† Before the match he writes down, ""Clean sheet, what do I need to get a clean sheet? Be big in the box, have clean build-up, and communicate well.""ù Zeller writes tips and other similar points on a notecard before taping it to his right shin guard and stepping out onto the field. Zeller finished the 2022-23 season leading the league with seven clean sheets. Zeller led the conference with 2022-23 seven clean sheets earned. The conference average was 3.89 clean sheets. Zeller also played more games than any other goalkeeper in the conference this season. However, he conceded only 20 goals, which was below the conference average of 20.56 goals conceded. (Lucas Webster / Daily Nexus) Zeller said he approaches the game without fear. ""I don't get nervous. I like confrontation,""ù he said. ""I am always looking forward to testing myself, every game. If you get nervous, it [weakens] you, you get stuck ""¶ I get excited. I love the environment.""ù He loves the energy and excitement of the fans and appreciates those who come out to support UCSB soccer.† ""We love to get the fans hyped, we love when you guys are out there and cheer us on, that's the whole purpose. When you have a good time, we have a good time,""ù Zeller said. ""The Cal Poly game is packed, and I would love to see that crowd attendance across every game. That would be class.""ù Zeller facing the home crowd during the 2022 UCSB vs. Cal Poly men's soccer game (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) Despite all of the effort, mental fortitude and individual achievements, UCSB men's soccer lost in the conference final to UC Riverside by a score of 1-0.† However, Zeller said he was not discouraged by the defeat.† ""After the game was done, all the fans, like 3000 to 4000, came at me and were yelling and screaming, but that motivates me now to go into this next season and show them who we are, who UCSB is and that this won't happen again,""ù he said. Zeller thanking Gaucho fans after a home game (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) According to Zeller, the upcoming 2023-24 season will be his final college season, and he has aspirations to play professionally.† ""If there is a team coming up who would like to draft me ""¶ I would love to stay here [in the U.S.]. If there is an opportunity to go to the first league, MLS, or [second league] Championship, I would go,""ù he said.† He would also welcome a return to Europe, saying ""If there is an option coming up from England, Germany or in Europe for a league, I would definitely go then.""ù His dream would be to sign for Liverpool F.C., and play under their manager J√ºrgen Klopp, whom he met and spoke with in his youth back in Germany.† Zeller wishes to thank all of the Gaucho soccer supporters this past season, and he is looking forward to the next season. ""Thank you for coming to the games, being part of it, being part of the journey of UCSB soccer, and I hope this upcoming season we will have a great run in the tournament,""ù he said.

data,"Tracing cultural, geographical, racial roots of cannabis",20-Apr-23,4:20 PM,"['Angelina Song', 'Jake Jensema']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-20/tracing-cultural-geographical-racial-roots-of-cannabis/,"420, weed, mary jane and pot are all colloquial terms for the green leafy drug formally known as cannabis. Cannabis is a plant-based drug whose properties can range from relaxation to euphoria, depending on the tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol percentages. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the compound that gives weed its psychoactive effects, also known as the high. Cannabidiol (CBD) is known for its relaxing and calming effects but does not cause a high. Hemp is associated with CBD, and marijuana is associated with THC. ""The THC level is what differentiates a hemp plant [in] legal usage, as opposed to the marijuana plant, which then has to be regulated ""¶ The hemp plant has 0.3 [percent THC], or less. The marijuana plant has more because higher than that dose could potentially have a psychoactive effect,""ù said One Plant Goleta's general manager Bryon Bryan. Traditionally, weed is sold as dried plant material called flower or bud, which is then burned and inhaled. Methods of inhaling bud involve pens, bongs and pipes. As cannabis has become more accessible via legislation, the selection of products has grown.. Edibles and vaporizing cartridges allow users to consume or inhale without having to burn the plant itself. The variety and growth of diverse weed products provides people who don't like to smoke an alternative to accessing and consuming cannabis.† ""I think that cannabis really just brings people together,""ù said Alyssa Romero, a cannabis retail specialist at Farmacy Isla Vista. ""I think that people are able to bond over weed, they're able to get together, whether they're using it socially or if they're able to relate to each other saying, like, oh, you know, smoking a joint really helps with your anxiety, too? And that creates friendships and fosters relationships.""ù Though cannabis is one of the oldest recreational drugs in the world, its status as a legal drug in the United States has been fairly contentious. Hemp was often grown in the colonies, and cannabis was used in medicine during the 19th century. After Prohibition ended in the early 20th century, Harry Anslinger, an ex-Prohibition politician, saw this as an opportunity to gain power. He spread paranoia and blatant lies about the supposed dangers of the plant and blamed it on people of color, primarily: Mexicans immigrating to the U.S. to flee the Mexican Revolution and jazz musicians, who were a predominantly Black demographic at the time. ""Harry Anslinger was heading the [Federal Bureau of Narcotics]. What he was doing was basically turning marijuana into a racialized subject,""ù explained assistant history professor Utathya Chattopadhyaya. ""So marijuana becomes something you want to stop [doing] because it's associated with immigrants, jazz musicians, youth culture, basically disorderly elements.""ù† In part to this fear-mongering campaign, the U.S. government criminalized the growing of hemp under the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937.† These fear tactics toward cannabis affected the perceptions of Americans for decades to come. Cannabis is still classified in the same category with drugs like heroin, and to this day, many believe that it is a gateway drug according to Romero.† While these laws are unbiased on paper, in practice, they are used to justify the arrest of Black and Brown people at disproportionate rates.† In recent years, the government and the people have started to reinstate cannabis legalization. In 1996, California became the first state to legalize weed for medical purposes, bringing it in direct contention with federal law. Though cannabis has not yet been legalized on a federal level, forty states have since approved the use of medical cannabis, and twenty-one have further legalized it for recreational use ""ì including California in 2016. ""I think the legalization comes out of two things. One, medical research on the cannabis plant, that's basically showing the possible medicinal uses for anxiety, medications, things like that. All of that research plus [two], the opposition to the war on drugs ""ì like the popular social movement against [it],""ù Chattopadhyaya said. Despite the legal challenges and zoning difficulties of opening a legal dispensary, businesses have scrambled in an attempt to meet customer demand. Total taxable sales of legal weed in California have almost doubled in the past five years and quadrupled in Santa Barbara County.† Yet, there is still a massive market for weed in California. Angelina Song / Daily Nexus Total taxable sales of legal weed in California have quadrupled in Santa Barbara County from 2018-2022 due to dispensaries opening to sell. In a smaller reflection of this trend, two cannabis shops have recently emerged near UC Santa Barbara: One Plant Goleta, which opened in May 2021, and Farmacy Isla Vista, which opened its doors Dec. 2022. These two stores are both within a two-mile radius of UCSB, and much of their clientele consists of of-age students. ""For the license to [sell cannabis], you have to have a lot of capital which you're investing into, and then also having storefronts. But not a lot of people can do that. And then the maintenance of the farms is also expensive, Chattopadhyaya said. So for people who can't put up that kind of money, they basically grow cannabis anyway, and then just sell on the black market.""ù† In California alone, marijuana is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it is here to stay. ""My guess is weed culture is going towards what is called the agro-business model, where large farmers will be growing for [most of the population]. Because it's so capital intensive, you need so much money to start it ""¶ and then we will see a kind of concentration of capitalist power in the market,""ù Chattopadhyaya predicted. Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus The average total taxable cannabis sales map categorizes California's counties based on their taxable sales of cannabis, with darker shades of green indicating higher sales. Notably, populous areas such as Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Barbara have emerged as major players in the cannabis market, likely due to their dense population and accessibility of dispensaries in these locations. Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus Per capita sales, which is calculated as total taxable sales over the population, offers a different perspective. Although Mono and Inyo Counties exhibit the darkest shade of green, they may not generate as much cannabis sales as the major cities. However, when it comes to the average amount spent per person on cannabis, these counties are evidently prominent contributors. An interesting observation is that San Francisco stands out in both charts, demonstrating a substantial volume of cannabis sales as well as a high average spending per person. As for how weed culture differs by county, Los Angeles and coastal areas are known for their weed cultures. This is reflected in the average total taxable sales figure, where the West Coast dominates weed sales. However it's also interesting to note how per capita, eastern counties have higher sales. For instance, Mono County's average per capita sales are the highest average per capita sales out of all the California counties. Other eastern counties with higher sales include Inyo County and Yuba County. Even among the West Coast, differences still exist with weed culture being more prominent in Los Angeles than in Santa Barbara.† ""There's definitely a huge difference, and I honestly think that's because cannabis is newer here in the 805, and we're still trying to pave a path for people to see cannabis as something that is beneficial, whereas I feel like in Long Beach, LA, it's already been a little more normal,""ù said Romero. Nevertheless, the popularity of weed has been steadily rising.† ""I think that's really important,""ù said Bryan. ""I think it's critical for us to destigmatize cannabis and stop viewing it as something that is hurtful. So with this increase in the amount of people that are opening their minds and being willing to try cannabis, the more people that are able to realize that this isn't a bad thing, that it's super helpful both, you know, mentally, physically, spiritually.""ù And despite popularity among the nation, states and counties, concerns revolving around cannabis culture is inevitable. ""Regardless, if you like cannabis or not, do your research, do some education. Educate yourself on the different ways that cannabis can be consumed, the different benefits it may have before,""ù Romero said.† Jackie Chen contributed to reporting.

Print Thanks for the interesting journalism. I think some points were missed. First, there is no mention of the previous CA decriminalization of weed. Much like prostitution, legalization is quite different from decriminalization. Why allow corporate interests into something that is already decriminalized? (Think Philip Morris targeting children). Second, there is no mention of how illegal sales have increased (with all the destruction of CA forests). Obviously, legal sales have increased, but so have illegal sales, since minus taxes, they are cheaper. The net results are the weed use is far more prevalent. Some see this is a good thing.

data,Beyond Stereotypes: Explaining the push behind Asian Americans in S.T.E.M.,25-May-23,1:42 PM,"['Angelina Song', 'Faye Vuong']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-25/beyond-stereotypes-explaining-the-push-behind-asian-americans-in-s-t-e-m/,"With AAPI month coming to a close, we reflect on the long-held stereotypes that Asian Americans are naturally inclined toward S.T.E.M. fields. At UC Santa Barbara, we can see this pattern reflected as well. On average, Asian Americans make up 25% of UCSB students. But in some majors, such as microbiology, computer science, computer engineering, this number rises to above 40%. And among the majors with the highest percentage of Asian American students, many S.T.E.M. majors dominate the list.† Ôªø The Asian population in the United States has been one of the fastest-growing populations for the past 40 years. According to Pew Research Center, ""Nearly six-in-ten U.S.-born Asians (58%) were members of Generation Z in 2019, which means they were 22 or younger at the time.""ù† This increase in the percentage of people of Asian descent has been largely brought about by immigration. In 1980, 18% of the 14 million immigrants were born in an Asian country. By 2019, not only had the number of immigrants jumped to 45 million, but roughly 31% of those immigrants came from an Asian country. Overall, Asians in the U.S. tend to be a well-educated and high-earning group. According to Pew Research Center, more than half of all Asians aged 25 and older have bachelor's degrees. Asians tend to have a higher median salary ""î $85,800 ""î which is almost $20,000 higher than all U.S. households. This can be attributed to working in S.T.E.M. fields, which generally pay better regardless of education level. In fact, despite making up 10% of the workforce, Asians make up 17% of all S.T.E.M. workers and have a higher representation in all high-paying S.T.E.M. clusters.† Many foreign-born Asians have come over on H-1B visas, which are education-based visas.† In order to be selected for an H-1B visa, one must have a bachelor's degree and a U.S. company to sponsor them. Notably, in 2019, 86.3% of all H-1B petitions filed were from applicants from China or India alone, and generally, Asian countries exhibit a strong presence in the applications. Since the H-1B program was started in 1990, roughly 2 million workers have immigrated to the U.S. to work as highly skilled professionals ""î many in fields such as engineering, technology and medicine. This immigration, in turn, has had demographic and cultural effects.† First, the economic prosperity of H-1B workers, indicated by a median household income of $108,000, fosters a privileged community. Families with this sort of economic capital are already able to provide their children with better resources and opportunities. Second, because many of these immigrants were able to achieve a high-income life through S.T.E.M.-based careers, they tend to instill in their children a strong appreciation for the opportunities and advantages that come with pursuing a job in a S.T.E.M. field. Whether through indirect influence from parents or mere observation, children of immigrant parents tend to see more benefits to choosing a career in S.T.E.M. ""I guess you could say it worked for them because studying computer science and studying technology allowed them to come to America and provide the life that they provided for my family,""ù Anirudh Iyer, a second-year computer science major, explained. This partially explains the high number of Asian workers in the S.T.E.M. workforce. According to Pew Research Center, ""Asian workers are 13% of those employed in STEM occupations, overrepresented compared with their 6% share of total employment across all occupations.""ù† However, there are additional factors to consider. Another contributing theory of the tendency for Asian Americans to pursue S.T.E.M. is that of success frames. Jennifer Lee, a Columbia University graduate and UC Irvine professor, explains a frame as ""an analytical tool by which people observe, interpret, and make sense of their social life. Most plainly, frames are ways of understanding how the world works.""ù In interviews done by her and Min Zhou, a fellow researcher, she discovered that many of these immigrant parents, regardless of class or country of origin, often echoed the same ideas behind the way to achieve the best life for their children in America.† Most families, regardless of ethnicity, want their children to have a good education and a good career. But for Asian Americans, the idea of a good education and success takes on a narrow and specific path. This path involves working hard in school, getting good grades (usually defined as A's), going to a highly-ranked college and landing a financially stable job (in law, technology, medicine or similar fields).† ""They definitely believe that studying hard and going into these S.T.E.M. fields, which are typically higher paying relative to other fields, is the best way to guarantee success and financial security for their kids, which they obviously want,""ù Iyer said. While very few Asian parents live up to the strict ""Tiger Mom""ù stereotype and force their children to take on certain professions and majors, it would be naive to say that these widespread cultural values have not played an impact in the way Asian Americans are socialized in the United States. These ideas are spread through Asian communities by social circles, word of mouth, and even online networks such as WeChat groups. This communal social circle becomes a resource by which many Asian parents base their decisions on. To achieve the standards set by their community, they will relocate to live in places with better schools, teach their children the belief that good grades are a result of hard work, and enroll their children in tutoring and additional education programs.† Asian parents spend 15% of their income on extra education for their children, whereas the average American household spends merely 2%. This focus on academics and investment into education as the method to achieve a financially stable future is a widespread belief in the Asian American community. ""[My parents] knew that in order to come to America and to live what they thought to be a definitely better life, they would have to study hard and they would have to get the grades and do all this stuff in order to find success,""ù Iyer said. However, while these beliefs may indeed pay off in capitalistic terms, they can inadvertently impose undue pressure on Asian children, potentially disregarding their unique aptitudes and aspirations for a more suitable path. ""You have these immigrant parents, who have not grown up here, and have not gone to school around here. The information they are working off of is very fragmentary and often based on hearsay. What are the top 10 schools anybody has heard of? If your community only recognizes these 10 schools and these four professions as prestigious ones, why would you encourage your kids to exploit prestige as well as economic stability?""ù erin Khu√™ Ninh, an associate professor in the Asian American studies department at UCSB explained. Here, Ninh points out a discrepancy in the logic of the success frame. If the community views specific jobs and colleges as the only way to achieve success, and all others as failures, this ignores the thousands of other possibilities that could also lead to a successful future.† Shiuan Cheng, a second-year physics major, said he would have liked to pursue photography as his career, but upon considering the financial investment of a degree, chose physics instead. ""I'd go into photography as my career, but it's not as financially convenient as engineering is,""ù Cheng said. Furthermore, it is important to note that Asian Americans are an extremely diverse group, hailing from many different countries around the globe ""î all with their own cultural values and beliefs toward education. Many Asian Americans do value and choose to pursue humanities. In fact, one of the most popular majors among Asian American students at UCSB is communication. ""I think you can't really make a generalization about all Asians because each Asian culture differs so drastically. Like I'm half Chinese, half Japanese and just the differences between those two cultures is tremendous,""ù Olivia Jonokuchi, a second-year computer science major and founder of UCSB's Girls Who Code said. While Asian Americans make up a significant portion of S.T.E.M. students on campus, there is a lack of female Asian students in S.T.E.M. courses.† ""When I walk into my CS classes, I see maybe five or six girls. Most of my classes do consist of Asian males,""ù Iyer said. ""I know that being in a room where no one looks like me would make me less comfortable, as opposed to being in a room where I know likely that people will share experiences.""ù Jonokuchi, who saw this same discrepancy in her STEM courses, took the initiative to form additional safe spaces through Girls Who Code, which has a mission to ""Build a community with other women and non-binary students in STEM.""ù† Pew Research Institute reports that representation among women in S.T.E.M. occupations has failed to change since 2016. As of 2019, women only account for 25% of people working in computer occupations and only 15% in engineering occupations. Asian-American women in S.T.E.M. are recorded to have slightly higher averages than other women of color, but they still continue to trail behind white women throughout all fields. Family pressures throughout Asian-American culture often play a significant role in shaping children's aspirations. The ""tight-knit""ù familial nature present in many households can, at times, prioritize the family unit over personal ambitions. ""I do feel a pressure to perform well academically, to get a good job and support my family,""ù Jonokuchi said. ""My mom jokes that ""òWhen you make it big, you'll buy me a Tesla!' I've always wanted to give back to my family since they've done so much for me. Even if I weren't Asian, I would do that.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the May 25, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

data,Flex your schedule: The best time to hit the Recreation Center,1-Jun-23,8:30 AM,['Jake Jensema'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-01/flex-your-schedule-the-best-time-to-hit-the-recreation-center/,"The UC Santa Barbara Recreation Center is one of the most sought-after destinations on campus, drawing in a staggering number of visitors each day. The Recreation Center boasts three primary fitness buildings, one of which has recently reopened following renovations to the air ventilation system. In addition to a sprawling outdoor area, this Recreation Center is the go-to spot for all UCSB students looking to work up a sweat. Given the high volume of foot traffic, it can be challenging to determine the optimal time to drop by. That's why we've conducted a comprehensive data analysis to uncover trends and patterns, providing valuable insights to answer the burning question: When is the optimal time to visit the Recreation Center? The chart features a gradient scale that provides a visual representation of the Recreation Center's visitor count. The scale ranges from blue, indicating a low number of visitors, to red, representing a high number of visitors. The more red visible on the chart, the busier the Recreation Center is at that particular time. (Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus) Data was collected from the fall 2019 and 2022 quarters. Visualization of the data illustrates that the number of individuals visiting the Recreation Center varies from hour to hour, peaking around 9 a.m. and later at 4-5 p.m.† Such information can be utilized by facility managers and staff to optimize the center's services, staffing and hours of operation, ultimately enhancing the overall experience of visitors.† ""I have worked at the Rec for a year and a half and my experience working here has been amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better job. My coworkers are awesome, the environment is always positive and also it makes it easy to work out every day because I'm already there working,""ù communications and global studies double major and Recreation Center operations assistant Jacquelin Groswirt said.† In regards to the Recreation Center schedule, Groswirt said that it is customary to have two individuals present at the front desk at all times, regardless of the hour. However, she said that accounting for the times where more people enter the recreation center would be beneficial in ensuring that they have sufficient staff coverage. Trevor Bagan, a third-year economics major, and Jacob Harden, a first-year economics major, are both frequent visitors to the Recreation Center who prefer to hit the gym at either early afternoon or later at night to avoid the 5-6 p.m. rush hour. ""Lately I've been going to the Recreation Center first thing in the morning, usually from 8-10 a.m., but on some days I might have a late start and defer to later in the evening after I've finished my school work,""ù Bagan said.† Harden tries to plan his visits to the gym ahead of time. †""I do a mix of both [early and late]. I try to make a schedule that allows me to go at 11 a.m. every day if possible. I just enjoy going at that time and there aren't too many people,""ù Harden said. The Recreation Center's visitation is impacted by midterm and finals weeks during each quarter. The pinker the color on this chart, the more crowded the Recreation Center is. Filtered data highlights the intensity of week five ""î midterm week. (Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus) ""The busiest time is typically in the early or late afternoon, depending on the time of year [quarter], such as during midterm and finals week,""ù third-year communication major and Recreation Center social media specialist Laney Chao said. ""I would say it depends not just on the time of day, but also what part of the quarter it is. The beginning of the quarter is usually busy, and midterm and finals weeks are less busy,""ù said second-year statistics and data science major Pesk Son. During midterm and finals week, there is a noticeable decrease in the average number of visitors to the Recreation Center. Specifically, there is a reduction of 27 individuals per hour on average, resulting in a total of approximately 460 fewer individuals coming into the Recreation Center per day. The heat map chart showcases the hourly amount of visitors at the Recreation Center. The intensity of each box's color represents the visitor count. Darker shades denote high traffic, while lighter shades indicate a smaller crowd. (Jake Jensema / Daily Nexus) The heat map chart reveals that the peak time for visitors is 4-5 p.m. on Mondays, with more than 300 people hitting the Recreation Center during that hour. In contrast, the early morning and late-night hours see consistently low foot traffic throughout the week. This begs the question: Why do these off-peak times have such low attendance? ""I don't have the energy to work out when I wake up, and by the time my day is done, I'm too tired. Going in the middle of the day fits my schedule, and I have enough energy to get a good workout in,""ù third-year political science major Will Macy explained. With busy schedules and demanding coursework, it can be difficult to find the motivation and energy to work out very early in the morning or late at night. For many, the evening is the most convenient time to fit in a workout. Additionally, working out during this time can provide a much-needed break from classes and studying and can even boost productivity and focus.† Our analysis provides some information that visitors can use to their advantage. Avoiding crowds and scheduling ones visit to the Recreation Center can make a huge difference in the overall experience. By choosing the right time to go, one can avoid the frustration and stress of dealing with long lines and overcrowded facilities. Whether looking to work out, swim or just enjoy some leisure time, taking the time to plan your visit can ensure getting the most out of your visit to the Recreation Center.† Alice Zhang contributed reporting.

data,"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the Daily Nexus",12-Jul-23,2:00 PM,"['Siddharth Chattoraj', 'Pricila Flores']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-12/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-at-the-daily-nexus/,"      Document         Three years after the creation of the Diversity and Inclusion task force, here is how we have honored DEI.By: Siddharth Chattoraj and Pricila Flores  July 12, 2023 at 2:00 pm
     Diversity and inclusion first became an initiative with the Daily Nexus in 2020, following the murder of George Floyd. Created by the editorial staff and calling themselves the Diversity Task Force, they promised three things:† Additionally, in their plans for the school year, one of the initiatives was to conduct an anonymous staff survey to gain a better understanding of the Nexus's demographics. They outlined that survey topics should include race, gender, job status, academic background, prior non-Nexus journalism experience, first-generation status and hometown location.† They hoped the survey would provide an opportunity for members to assess the Nexus's workplace dynamics and provide feedback that will be used for the creation of future initiatives. Their and our current goal is to identify which communities are represented within the Nexus, and how we can better recruit writers and editors to mirror the diversity of experiences of our student body.† Three years later, our Diversity Task Force grew to become the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team, and the DEI initiatives and progress have surpassed what our predecessors once planned.† Through years of DEI staff training, we have been able to highlight the point that the Diversity Task Force introduced. That is, having a diverse set of editors and writers, those who ultimately write our content, is the first step in fostering DEI. We have been resources for section editors when they aren't sure how to diversify their writer group. Our first piece of advice is always to reach out to other major email listservs besides English, communication, sociology and other writing-based majors. Many people think that to join the Daily Nexus, they need to be a stellar writer or have been editor in chief in high school. When in reality, almost half of our staff had no previous journalism experience. An overlooked stepping stone of DEI within the Nexus is the ""E,""ù for equity. We tasked sections to define what equity means to them and challenged them to look internally in order to better the external. Why were people intimidated to join our organization that so many of us call family? After discussions and setting action-based goals, each content-producing section has training workshops in place for those interested in joining.† But this work has not always come easily, and the DEI chairs have had the challenge of redefining DEI to how it will best fit within the editorial staff, relying on the conceptual job description created by the Diversity Task Force, all while being hired during the COVID-19 pandemic.† Having to create our own job descriptions, we moved away from generally thinking of the three prongs of the acronym, and we made the concept niche, allowing for introspective thinking. We defined DEI to fit within the questions: How does identity affect you as a journalist, and how does identity affect journalism? This got our staff thinking about how their identities impacted the content they choose to produce and publish.† Below are graphs that contrast the DEI-related topics and issues covered from 2018 (a time before DEI was an editorial position) to 2023, a time in which DEI is a strong presence in the editorial staff.† With the exception of 2020, there has been an increase in the average number of DEI keywords in Nexus articles each year since 2018. As of March 9, there were four times as many DEI keywords on average in Nexus articles in 2023 than there were when tracking began.† †Dylan Fu and Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
Since 2020, there has been a general increase in the average number of DEI-related keywords present in Nexus articles per month within each year and, as the 2023 trendline shows, we plan to continue increasing the holistic production of DEI-related content throughout the year.† We also recognize that while we have made significant progress in increasing our holistic coverage of DEI-related content, we still have room to improve upon the slight drop over the last couple of years in DEI-related content between July and September. †Dylan Fu and Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
The highlighted region in each chart represents the 95% confidence interval for each trendline, which means that we are 95% confident that the average number of DEI-related keywords per article falls within the shaded region when considering the corresponding values on the trendline. Coming back to the Diversity Task Force's goals, we have conducted an anonymous editorial staff survey for the academic school year of 2023. The survey, conducted in tandem with the Data and DEI teams, was created in hopes to see the areas in which our staff could grow to become more diverse in the identities on board. The last time the survey was conducted was in 2018, and 28 of the then 39-member editorial staff responded. Below are our findings from the 2023 editorial staff survey and how we can grow from here.† 54 out of the Nexus's 58 editors ""î incoming, continuing and outgoing ""î responded to the anonymous survey. Editors were able to select multiple responses if more than one response fits their background or identity. While the data below will display the makeup of the Nexus editorial staff, the Nexus does not make hiring decisions on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity or hometown location.† The Copy team, which reviews articles for grammar and style, has the largest number of editors out of all sections. Most sections have between two to three editors. †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † † Of the 2023-24 Nexus editorial staff ""î which will consist of 41 editors: 16 fourth-years, 12 third-years and 13 second-years ""î 66% will be returning editors from the previous year.† Out of all 54 editors surveyed, a very small minority are first-generation or transfer students. We recognize that as the Nexus covers a significant amount of news that may impact first-generation or transfer students, we must take extra consideration into ensuring that the voices of first-generation and transfer students are represented when reporting on those issues. †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
The most popular majors among editors are majors related to writing, English or communication. However, there are a significant number of S.T.E.M. and art majors among the staff, as well as 16 editors being double majors. We are proud to have editors from many years and majors on our staff representing a wide range of perspectives and experiences, allowing us to be well-versed in a variety of disciplines to effectively engage with the diverse Santa Barbara community.†† The chart below displays the word makeup of the names of the editors' majors and minors. Words that were more common are displayed in a larger font. Our editors study a variety of disciplines including statistics, history, biology, politics, technology, communication, writing, theater and more. †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
Since 2018, the Nexus has significantly grown its editorial staff and, concurrently, the total number of editors identifying as a woman has more than doubled. The Nexus also has four editors who do not identify as solely men or women.† The proportion of editors who identify as women on the editorial staff has increased since 2018, currently standing at 72.2%, but the proportion of editors who identify as men has decreased to 20.4%.† While the proportion of editors who identify as a man is low, it is important to note that other University of California college newspapers ""î including the Daily Bruin and The California Aggie ""î also have similar staff proportions listed in their diversity reports, albeit they surveyed both writers and editors.† †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
The Nexus has also seen an increase in the number of editors identifying as people of color, who currently make up 68.5% of the editorial staff ""î an increase from 53.6% in 2018. A significant rise in the proportion of Asian and mixed editors and a decline in the proportion of white editors fueled this increase.† While we are proud of the progress we have achieved in our efforts to continuously promote DEI, we recognize that it does not extend to all racial demographics. The Nexus still does not have the perspectives of every race and ethnicity on campus. We do not have the perspectives and voices of the Black, Indigenous or Pacific Islander community on staff. Additionally, the number of editors of color, specifically Hispanic editors, has decreased by approximately five percentage points since 2018. On the flip side, the current proportion of Asian editors is significantly higher than the current proportion of Asian students at UC Santa Barbara, taken from the campus profiles released by the UCSB Office of Budget & Planning. But, the current proportion of Hispanic editors is much lower than the current proportion of Hispanic students at UCSB.† †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
As the Nexus frequently covers news and events that may affect African American, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and Indigenous groups, we understand that we must take extra steps in our hiring and recruiting process so that our reporting has authentic voices to write and provide context and perspectives we do not hold. While not a requirement by any means to be a part of the Nexus, we have found that 61% of our editorial staff are multilingual and 15% are trilingual. The most common languages spoken by our editors include Spanish, Mandarin and French. La Vista, the Nexus's Spanish-language section, brought more Spanish-speaking editors onboard. It was founded in 2022 to make news accessible to the Hispanic and Latine community on campus but also to the large Hispanic and Latine community in Isla Vista. As the founder of the DEI team, a former DEI co-chair and as a Latina whose parents rely on Spanish news markets like Telemundo and Univision, I felt it was my duty to pioneer a space for our news to be accessible. Being a reputable news source on campus, it felt odd to leave out the community of Isla Vista, considering most students live in residences off of campus and interact with community members daily. La Vista became a branch between the community off campus, which encompasses families and the students on campus. La Vista reports on special events off campus like mariachi and folk√≥rico performances around town where the Latine community gathers. †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
Although there is diversity in the languages spoken by our editors, the majority of our staff are from California. There is one editor each from Maryland, Virginia, New Mexico and Washington. Additionally, there are two editors from outside the United States, with one from Taiwan and another from Singapore. †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
This proportion is similar to the student hometown breakdown at UCSB: California residents make up 81% of the undergraduate student body and 70% of the graduate student body, according to the 2022-23 UCSB Campus Profile.† However, all hometowns of editors from California are clustered into one of three locations: the Bay Area, the greater Los Angeles area and San Diego. Eight editors are from San Diego ""î the most of any city. Most editors from the Bay Area reside in Santa Clara County.† †Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus † †
While our editors may come from similar places ""î an important factor for us to keep in mind when reporting on issues that may not be ""close to home""ù ""î they also come from diverse backgrounds and hold a variety of different interests. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, as editorial positions, has celebrated two years of existence at the Daily Nexus. We have accomplished renovating the way we think about pitches, content and projects we produce by tying it to identity to internally reflect on who is on our staff through the anonymous survey to equip ourselves with these questions for 2023-24 school year:† How do we make the Nexus more welcoming to those who have never written any journalistic piece before? How do we continue to diversify our newsroom to include voices we've never had on our staff? With all that being said, I am immensely proud of each and every section editor and our writers for producing unique and important content.† Yours,† Pricila Flores, Editor in Chief and Siddharth Chattoraj, Data Editor For any general questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to eic@dailynexus.com.

data,Changing directions: Experiences of UCSB transfer student athletes,7-Aug-23,9:25 AM,['Michelle Tekawy'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-07/changing-directions-experiences-of-ucsb-transfer-student-athletes/,"If one were to ask an athlete what their recruitment experience was like and how they ended up choosing the University of California, Santa Barbara, they may be able to draft a whole book on their athletic journey. Many collegiate student-athletes have been committed to their sports as early as their preschool age, and some even knew it was their mission to play their sport at the collegiate level by then. As high school freshmen and sophomores, these athletes can connect and communicate with the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) college coaches. Sometimes college coaches reach out to high school recruits first after studying their talents and potential, while other times recruits must make the first move. Although a considerable portion of college student-athletes ultimately compete for the institution they initially committed to during high school, a significant number still perceive their athletic recruitment journey as ongoing, prompting them to transfer to different schools. As of the 2022-2023 season, UCSB is home to 66 transfer athletes who make up 13% of the UCSB athletics population. The large majority of athletes are non-transfers who committed to UCSB in high school and remained in the UCSB athletics program. There is at least one transfer athlete participating in every sport at UCSB.†  UCSB boasts its prestigious academics, high performing athletics team and its beautiful location ""î all of which draws potential transfer athletes. ""The prestige of the school academically is a big reason. The location is a big reason. When I did an unofficial visit I was blown away by how beautiful the area is and how kind the team was,""ù Alec Mortensen, incoming junior transfer on the men's swim team said. Alec Mortensen (Courtesy of Matt Folsom) On the other hand, UCSB outfielder and rising redshirt senior Jared Sundstrom transferred across the state for the program available.† ""I chose it [UCSB] because they just historically had a really good baseball program,""ù Sundstrom said. Jared Sundstrom (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) The Process While transfer athletes come from all different parts of the country, their journey starts the same, through the transfer portal. The transfer portal is similar to getting recruited in high school in the way that athletes and coaches communicate back and forth to learn more about each other and the program. However, the transfer process delves deeper into the prospective athletes' alignment with the school's eligibility, academic, and athletic level requirements. This is crucial for achieving acceptance and entry into the new institution while also ensuring adherence to NCAA transfer regulations. ""The differences [in high school and college transfer recruits] certainly outweigh the similarities,""ù UCSB's Deputy Athletic Director Jessica Goerke said. ""Transfer students have much tighter and more complicated eligibility requirements than a student who arrives at UCSB as a freshman. These requirements get harder to navigate the later an individual transfers in their academic career. As a result, major options become limited and course selection each quarter becomes even more delicate, especially when you factor in practice and competition times.""ù Jessica Carlton, a third-year and recent UCSB women's soccer transfer from Boston College, remembers feeling stressed when trying to transfer schools.† ""There are just a lot of uncertainties with the transfer portal, and I had to make a highlight video and contact coaches again like I did in high school, but there was a lot less time to do this. I had no idea how much money would be left at schools or if they even needed another player.""ù Even though Carlton felt under pressure during the transfer portal, she said her other teammates from Boston were in the same boat as her.† ""Luckily, many of my teammates were also transferring, and my team at Boston was super supportive and understood why I or anyone else was leaving.""ù Jessica Carlton (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) Similarly to Carlton, Mortensen experienced complications during his transferring process. In fact, talking to UCSB was Mortensen's third experience getting recruited to swim for a school after transferring from Grand Canyon University and West Valley College. Mortensen swam his first year at GCU until he was notified that he was cut from the program. However, he moved quickly in the recruiting process to his next stop, WVC, and his final destination, UCSB. ""Both ""òtransfer portal' experiences for me have been pretty rapid. It only took a few days before I found my next school, West Valley College ""î a community college ""î who was extremely welcoming,""ù Mortensen said. Mortensen had a successful season at WVC and made huge time improvements from his lifetime bests at this championship meet which took place in May. This gave him a better shot at returning to a Division I school. ""It was already May by this point. I immediately emailed schools and got interest back quite fast. It only took about 2 weeks until I was committed to UCSB,""ù Mortensen said. Academics & Environment† The UCSB women's tennis team has the highest proportion ""î 38% ""î of female transfer athletes, which is significantly higher than that of other women's sports.  Marta Gonzalez-Ballbe ""î a recent physics graduate and UCSB women's tennis player from Madrid, Spain who transferred to UCSB after her freshman year at North Carolina State ""î said she noticed that one of the most distinct differences between the two colleges was the weather. ""Every single day it's just sunny, warm temperatures and not too cool. I just like that because I can play tennis outside every day and get that vitamin D. I love it. It makes me happy,""ù Gonzalez-Ballbe said. Marta Gonzalez-Ballbe (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) Mikkel Vittarp G√∏ling ""î a new third-year transfer on the UCSB men's soccer team from Copenhagen, Denmark, was quick to notice the difference in faculty and location when comparing his previous college, Young Harris College. ""At my old school [YHC], we did not have a separate gym for only athletes, and then of course Harder stadium I think you could come from any school in the US and Harder [Stadium] would be an upgrade, amazing facility, and now also having a separate practice field its very different,""ù G√∏ling first mentioned. ""My old school was in Georgia, in the middle of nothing, which also had its charm. But being on the beach is a completely different environment,""ù G√∏ling continued. Mikkel Vitttarp G√∏ling (Courtesy of Steve Miller) Transferring to a different institution also comes with academic adjustments. For transfer prospects, adjusting to the UC quarter system may pose challenges if they come from a semester based school.† For Gonzalez-Ballbe, who transferred from North Carolina State University, remembers having an adjustment period with the ten week curriculum at UCSB.† ""I'm doing physics and a minor in stats. I remember, coming into college, I was like, ""òThe quarter system goes so fast!' But, in the quarter system, you study three to four classes for 10 intense weeks and you're done. It felt like a normal speed. ""¶ so I actually really like the quarter system,""ù Gonzalez-Ballbe said. Athletes also have to ensure that their coursework and major availability can transfer over to UCSB. ""No two institutions are the same, even within the UC system. This means that many transfer students lose units if a course is not transferable or if the major at their previous institution is either not offered by UCSB or is substantially different. Transfer students often need to be very strategic and intentional about their course selection to ensure they graduate in a preferred time frame,""ù Goerke said. Mortensen found himself needing to change major directions since UCSB does not offer his specific major. The swimmer was originally a business administration major at WVC, but he plans to major in sociology at UCSB.† Like Mortensen, G√∏ling also had to change his major from business administration at YHC to economics at UCSB. Coming from Santa Rosa Community College, Sundstrom appreciates the convenience and helpfulness of having academic advising that UCSB athletic provides.† ""We had an academic advisor at junior college, but he worked with a lot of teams. You had to have a meeting and he was super busy,""ù Sundstrom said. ""The academic advisor for baseball [at UCSB] helps with classes and questions. She also has almost monthly meetings and check-ins to make sure our schoolwork is running smoothly.""ù Carlton also brought up how priority registration for athletes helped her sign up for classes with ease. Typically, class registrations get stressful as many classes fill up quickly. With priority registrations, athletes can pick the classes they need to stay on track with academics and stay eligible for athletics as a full time student. ""Athletes here [at UCSB] get priority registration for classes which is something I didn't get at Boston, and it made it very difficult to register during the season,""ù Carlton said. Gonzalez-Ballbe described the transfer process as a ""pretty simple process.""ù ""Once you put your name in the portal, you'll start receiving like a bunch of emails of coaches being interested and wanting to talk to you.""ù G√∏ling, being an international student originally, had a different route. ""So first coming to America, most of the transfer process was through an agency called NSSA ""¶ I didn't know anything about the process or how that worked, but the Agency is made by former college players so I felt secure leaving it to the experts and that went well. Being in the portal and working with NSSA I tried to narrow down and find the right fit for me. "" G√∏ling started off. ""After 1.5 years [of playing at YHC], I wanted to see if I could find somewhere else that I could continue my journey soccer-wise as well as academically. I got a ton of interest in a short period of time even though it was an overwhelming process, but also a process that made me feel proud and happy because a lot of interest must have meant that in my 1.5 years at Young Harris, I had done something good together with my teammates and the staff around, as well as personal,""ù G√∏ling continued. Athletes may transfer due to the intense competition for playing time, according to Gonzalez-Ballbe. ""You can transfer for so many reasons,""ù Gonzalez-Ballbe said. ""While I liked the school and liked the team, I was not participating as much on the team. I wanted to go somewhere else where I could represent more.""ù Even though the athletes are given roster spots, they are still not guaranteed the chance to play all the time since coaches want to put their top players in the competition to win. Similar to tennis, baseball is also a common sport where many players don't end up as ""starters,""ù and it puts them at risk of getting cut from the team and having to transfer to another college baseball program. The percent comparisons between different men's sports are different from those in the UCSB women's athletics program. UCSB men's volleyball had a smaller proportion of transfers compared to the women's team. There was also a large difference in transfer percentages for men's soccer, which was 20 percentage points higher than transfer players on the women's team.  Baseball has the fourth highest proportion of transfers among the UCSB men's Intercollegiate Athletics program, but the sport with the most transfer athletes in the collegiate spectrum is men's basketball ""î a trend that is also present at UCSB.† ""A lot of people get cut because there are so many people. Many go to junior college, so they can play and transfer as soon as they can,""ù Sundstrom said. Unlike the baseball players that came to junior colleges as a result of being cut from their previous university, Sundstrom originally chose to attend SRJC out of high school. Sundstrom explained that playing baseball in junior college was a first step. The coaches' goal at junior college is to help the athletes have a good season, so they can leave to play for a four-year college, Sundstrom said. In addition, the coaches have connections to collegiate coaches and can aid in referring current junior college players to four-year colleges. ""Everyone's mindset going into a junior college is trying to get out,""ù Sundstrom said. Most collegiate basketball players are willing to transfer often and quickly in order to get to the National Basketball Association (NBA). NBA prospects have high hopes in making it into the association, and they are doing anything they can to increase their odds in making it in a short matter of time. The rush for collegiate basketball players to play professionally also applies for baseball players in collegiate baseball. For collegiate baseball players, many have the goal to play professionally by getting drafted into Major League Baseball. ""I bet if you asked all college baseball players ""¶ there's got to be over 95% that would say ""òyes.' Everyone's trying to [get drafted],""ù Sundstrom said. Sundstrom was drafted No. 307 overall in the 10th round by the Seattle Mariners in the 2023 Major League Baseball Draft. While the UCSB athletes have embraced their new environment, they will undoubtedly hold a deep nostalgia for their former programs. ""West Valley provided me the opportunity to train at a high level while figuring out my academic goals with no pressure. My coaches and teammates lit the fire under me again after a discouraging start to my collegiate career,""ù Mortensen said. ""I miss my teammates from freshman year and a couple of friends from last year. But I'm glad that we play a lot of teams close to my home, so my mom can come watch,""ù Carlton expressed with gratitude. Embarking on the journey of transferring to a new school can often evoke feelings of apprehension and difficulty. However, this transition offers athletes the chance for a fresh start in finding success.† ""Earning the opportunity to swim at UCSB means a lot to me because there were so many moments where I felt like I was chasing something unattainable and was ready to give up on swimming. It feels like the years of work are paying off,""ù Mortensen concluded. In the world of collegiate athletics, each athlete's journey is a unique story waiting to be written. UCSB athletics have given many talented athletes like Sundstrom, Mortensen, Sundstrom, Carlton, Gonzalez-Balbe and G√∏ling an opportunity to grow, achieve and represent. With each new season and every game played, these athletes add their own chapter to the ever-evolving story of UCSB athletics.

data,"Studying abroad at UCSB: Trends across countries, majors and a pandemic",11-Aug-23,11:00 AM,"['Tracy Sun', 'Ryan Sevilla']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-11/studying-abroad-at-ucsb-trends-across-countries-majors-and-a-pandemic/,"With 82% of UCSB students in the 2022-23 school year hailing from California, the UC Santa Barbara Education Abroad Program offers the opportunity to further expand their horizons and embrace entirely new dimensions of cultural enrichment.† Since it was established in 1962, the UC Santa Barbara Education Abroad Program (EAP) has grown to over 170 programs that span across over 40 countries, offering students the opportunity to complete academic coursework and experience life at different campuses across the world. They can be frequently seen around campus spreading the word about studying abroad. Each year, more than a thousand students embark on this transformative journey ""î choosing to study in diverse destinations. According to the data provided by the UCSB Gaucho Credit Abroad website, a database that lists past study abroad courses that UCSB students have taken, 58% of the EAP course offerings are in European countries. But why? EAP expands on the UCSB experience ""î introducing students to new people and places ""î and tests the boundaries of who they are and what they can achieve.† Lauryn Smith, a 2023 UCSB graduate and Black studies and communication double major, participated in the Made in Italy, Florence program in the fall of 2021. She took classes about entrepreneurship, language and culture, marketing and the history of photography and cinema while abroad, visiting different on-site locations to learn about her major through a different lens. ""I wanted to have that global immersive experience for myself because prior to studying abroad, I had never gone out of the country on my own. I wanted to find myself, as cheesy as that sounds,""ù Smith said. Afterward, she was motivated to be a source of help for people that may find the planning process overwhelming, and upon her return to UCSB, she started working as a peer advisor for the Education Abroad Program. Meyers, a 2023 UCSB sociology graduate, studied at the University College Utrecht in the Netherlands during the winter and spring of 2022.† She took classes about Dutch history and culture, the history of the Cold War and urban geography, exploring a neighborhood for a research project on urban planning for the latter course. Living in a place where the people she could usually turn to for help were unavailable due to time differences helped her become more independent and confident that she can be anywhere in the world. After enjoying her time abroad and wanting to encourage others to experience it themselves, she also decided to become an EAP peer advisor after returning to UCSB. Studying abroad requires extensive planning to make sure that students are still able to graduate on time. One resource that is frequently recommended is the previously mentioned UCSB Gaucho Credit Abroad. On the website, students can filter for a particular country or major and receive a list of courses that satisfy these conditions.† ""The website was very helpful when you're trying to figure out what classes are being offered in your program and what classes other people have taken in the past,""ù Smith said.† However, some majors may have upwards of hundreds of options across different countries, making the large list of courses difficult to navigate.†    Smith said that more students may be mainly interested in Europe due to comfortability from popular depictions in media or any prior experiences visiting Europe.† ""I think people know what to expect out of Europe a little bit more, and that's why they tend to be like, ""òOh, I want to experience it to a higher degree than I have in the past,'""ù she said. Smith noted that people may be drawn to locations farther from the Americas to get a bigger contrast in experience but assured that they can get that anywhere that's outside the United States. Professor Juan Campo, the 2022-23 EAP faculty director at UCSB, corroborated this idea. ""There are a lot of romantic films that take place abroad in European countries such as ""òMidnight in Paris,' ""òThree Coins in the Fountain,' and the James Bond series, so there's a lot of publicity given to those countries in mass media,""ù he said. Campo said that more students are inspired to go there to experience what they have seen for themselves given the increased positive exposure these countries receive. He also cited the initial demographic makeup of American colleges and, thus, their study abroad programs as a reason for this bias.† ""Part of it is due to cultural heritage, given that America traditionally consists of Anglo-Europeans. Many of those white Anglo-Europeans were more well-to-do and able to send their students to college,""ù he said. ""Study abroad programs in college were first set up in the latter part of the 20th century, and due to these students's interest in Europe, these countries kind of got built into the fabric of studying abroad.""ù Despite the large bias towards studying abroad in Europe, Campo expressed that this trend may be in the process of changing.† ""We have more students from other backgrounds that are helping to reshape the dynamics for where students are going, especially for Asian countries. A lot of students want to go to Korea because they are interested in K-pop, or Japan because they studied martial arts,""ù he said.† As mass media begins to encompass countries outside of Europe, it is very likely that similar interest may arise there. Additionally, students's increased comfortability with Europe may actually contribute to the study abroad program, functioning as an initial exposure to the daunting experience of living in a foreign country and possibly leading to future study abroad programs that expand beyond the continent.† Another contributing factor to the relatively smaller study abroad participation outside of in Europe is the complicated process of making study abroad programs in other countries available to UC students.† ""Whenever a country comes up for consideration at a program site, we look for something where students can get something that's up to par with a UC course, and UCEAP staff review the course qualities as well as the university's academic reputation,""ù said Campo.† Universities may fail to meet these standards or have other problems ranging from incompatibility with the UC academic calendar to societal complications in certain countries such as ""gender discrimination, health issues or political conflicts.""ù† On top of this is the underpinning factor in a new program's success: student interest. ""We used to have short-term programs in Vietnam and Indonesia, but we never got enough students to make them viable,""ù Campo said. To address this, UCEAP has conducted several surveys to gauge what countries students may be interested in going to, which has helped in opening up some new options. When it comes to which majors tend to study abroad more, Campo observed that there are certain majors that tend to be more inclined to go abroad.† ""It's clear that people in the social sciences like global studies, communication, psych & brain sciences and environmental studies [often study abroad],""ù he said. In addition, students in the language departments will often go to countries where they can interact with native speakers of their language of study.† Students that have a double major have each major counted separately. Of the top 10 majors that studied abroad in the 2022-23 school year, six were within the humanities discipline. Letters is an interdisciplinary category that covers subjects such as history, literature and philosophy. (Ryan Sevilla / Daily Nexus) † Students that have a double major have each major counted separately. Students with unknown majors are excluded. The interdisciplinary studies major is counted in its own category to account for students that integrate both humanities and S.T.E.M.-related fields into their programs. (Ryan Sevilla / Daily Nexus) Indeed, humanities majors tend to participate in study abroad programs more than S.T.E.M. majors. Campo noted that the underrepresentation of the latter may be attributed to their requirement of specific courses that must be taken in sequence. However, the difference isn't as big as one might expect, averaging out over the last seven years to a ratio of about five humanities majors to every four S.T.E.M. majors.† ""I think getting more students from the S.T.E.M. areas would be great,""ù Campo said. ""Currently, majors such as global studies, environmental studies and our religious studies department are very active in promoting EAP. Some departments even have a list of pre-approved study abroad courses that count for credit on their websites.""ù This significantly increases the exposure of the programs and draws in further student interest. From 2016 to 2023, the 2018-19 and 2019-20 school years, the two right before the COVID-19 pandemic, had the highest participation numbers in the UCEAP. (Ryan Sevilla / Daily Nexus) In the 2020-21 academic year, in the midst of COVID-19, the number of students studying abroad across the UC schools dropped precipitously from the steady five to six thousand of the preceding years to less than a hundred, with most of them having chosen to extend their foreign stay from the previous year.† ""Initially, we were really worried about how we would survive COVID,""ù Campo said. ""But once the vaccine came in and people started going back to work and coming on campus, it was really just a matter of us trying to promote EAP to students and letting them know what the safe countries to go to are.""ù
 When asked about the current status of the study abroad program, Campo expressed his optimism. ""I think we've done really well, though we're not a hundred percent back to where we were before COVID. I'm really happy that we were able to bounce back,""ù he said. As a result of the increasing use of virtual environments that resulted from the pandemic, the office decided to begin holding both online and in-person meetings, which has given students more flexibility to access the program.† The students who ended up going abroad in the 2020-21 academic year also had to face challenges from how their respective countries responded to the pandemic. Due to the rise in cases in the U.S. around December, the Dutch government required Meyers to quarantine upon arrival, register her vaccine records and quarantine for even longer than her arrival quarantine period after she caught COVID-19 herself.† ""That wasn't very fun for the first couple of weeks,""ù she said. ""It did get better from there, but the pandemic definitely made things a little bit more difficult.""ù However, given how the 2022-23 academic year suggests a resurgence of interest in EAP as its participation was double the amount of the preceding year, the EAP peer advisors are optimistic that participation levels will return to how they were before, if not higher, now that the pandemic is over. Meyers believes many people from the classes of 2023 and 2024 may have been more hesitant to study abroad to avoid losing more time at UCSB.† ""The current freshmen and sophomores never had their college experiences impacted by COVID, so they have no problem going abroad,""ù she said.† Smith said that many incoming freshmen are already expressing interest, stopping by the office to start figuring out the logistics. Time will tell once EAP makes its full recovery. Overall, studying abroad offers a unique opportunity to enhance students' learning and cultural experiences, but students should not wait too long to decide or they will miss their chance.† ""In order to find the best program and time it right, it's really to your advantage to start planning early,""ù Campo said. Meyers added that living abroad is much more difficult to do after college, so students are encouraged to take advantage of EAP as an easy and safe opportunity to meet new people and grow. Students looking to go abroad to popular countries, such as England and Italy, or major in common fields, such as social sciences and foreign languages, are likely to find someone to learn from before they leave. However, a country's or major's lack of popularity and pre-existing references should not discourage students, as less popular programs could gain more exposure if more people are willing to explore them.† ""Explore options that are outside of your comfort zone because you never know what you can get out of that,""ù Smith said. With the multitude of countries and programs that EAP has to offer, a valuable experience could be obtained virtually anywhere.

data,"Isla Vista law enforcement response from June to August, summarized",31-Aug-23,8:24 PM,"['Asumi Shuda', 'Siddharth Chattoraj']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-31/isla-vista-law-enforcement-response-from-june-to-august-summarized/,"The Nexus summarized UC Santa Barbara Police Department's and Santa Barbara County Fire Department's responses to crime and fire reports in Isla Vista between June 9 and Aug. 9.† The UC Santa Barbara Police Department (UCPD) is one of the arresting agencies that have Isla Vista and UCSB campus areas under their jurisdictions. UCPD did not respond to requests for comment.† Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus The Nexus found that 215 crimes were reported to the UCPD from June 9 to Aug. 9. The most frequent type of reported crime was theft, making up 28.74% of total crime reports. Other frequently reported crimes were categorized as ""alcohol,""ù ""other,""ù ""drugs""ù and ""vandalism.""ù† Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus Of the 215 crimes reported, 41.4% of them resulted in an arrest, citation or conduct referral, with 20% leading to arrest and 19.07% a citation. The remaining 56.28% of crime reports did not result in a report filing.† UCPD crime reports were largely located between Camino Pescadero and Ocean Road, with the largest cluster ""î 45 crime reports ""î occurring between Cordoba Road and Del Playa Drive. The second largest cluster of 17 crime reports occurred near the intersection of Camino Del Sur and El Colegio Road ""î near Los Carneros Road, a frequent route taken to exit Isla Vista and enter the neighboring Goleta area. Other notable locations of crime reports include in the 6600 and 6700 block of Del Playa Drive, along West Campus Point Lane and near the intersection of Abrego Road and Camino Pescadero.† Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus There was a general decline in UCPD crime reports in July ""î with an average of 2.68 crimes reported per day ""î following a spike in June of five crime reports per day on average.† Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus Santa Barbara County Fire Department (SBC Fire) is the law enforcement agency that responds to fire reports in Isla Vista and UCSB's campus area. There were 11 fires reported in June and July 2023, with eight fires reported during the night and six fires in the last weeks of UCSB's Spring Quarter 2023. Of the 11, there were four intentional furniture fires, two rubbish fires, one grass fire from fireworks and four unintentional fires from cooking and other causes.† Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus SBC Fire Public Information Officer Scott Safechuck noted that this number of fire reports is not out of the ordinary and that there's been an improvement in decreasing intentionally set fire incidents from setting furniture ablaze or from fireworks. Regardless, he advised students of the dangers of setting fires regardless of size.† ""A fire can cause severe burn injuries to an individual, and it can get out of control very fast and cause more damage to structures, as well as threatening human life,""ù Safechuck said. ""If students are going to be getting rid of their furniture, it should not be through burning it, and they should be donating it to some of the nonprofit organizations in the county.""ù†

data,"UC and UCSB announce, reflect on fall 2023 undergraduate admission rates",31-Aug-23,8:15 PM,"['Asumi Shuda', 'Siddharth Chattoraj']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-31/uc-and-ucsb-announce-reflect-on-fall-2023-undergraduate-admission-rates/,"The UC released its undergraduate freshman admission rates and statistics for the 2023-24 academic year, revealing a record number of California undergraduate freshmen and the largest class of underrepresented freshmen ever admitted. Announced in a press release from the UC Office of the President, 88,285 California residents were admitted as freshmen for this upcoming academic year ""î an increase of 3.5% from fall 2022 admissions numbers. In total, the UC accepted 129,685 freshmen and 27,761 transfer students, totaling 157,446 students admitted into its undergraduate body. ""These numbers demonstrate the continued interest undergraduate students have in attending a UC campus and their recognition of the benefits of a UC education in supporting their economic mobility,""ù a UC Office of the President (UCOP) press release read.† The fall 2023 freshmen undergraduate class is the largest number of underrepresented students in UC history, the press release claimed. Of the admitted class, 37.6% are Chicanx/Latinx, 0.7% are American Indigenous, 5.5% are Black, 34.2% are Asian American and 19.1% are white. UCOP noted admission offers for American Indigenous students increased by 11.6% over 2022.† Regarding data of socioeconomic status, admitted undergraduates ""remained relatively flat compared to 2022 admission data,""ù according to the press release.† Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus In comparison, 38% of UCSB's fall 2023 freshmen class are from underrepresented groups. Of the admitted class under UCSB's classified categories, 37% are Asian American, 32% are Chicanx/Latinx, 5% are Black and 1% are American indigenous. 4% of the class declined to state their race and ethnicity. The UC saw progress in increasing American Indigenous student admissions ""î historically and currently the lowest percentage of the underrepresented admitted student body ""î from enacting the Native American Opportunity Plan in 2022, which covers in-state tuition and Student Services fees for eligible students.† To be eligible for the program, students must be a current or newly admitted UC undergraduate or graduate student who is a California resident and is enrolled in a federally recognized Native American, American Indian and/or Alaska Native tribe. The press release stated that this increased American Indigenous admissions offers by 11.6% over 2022.† The Nexus inquired the University on what steps they'll be taking toward Black student admission and retention, as this percentage is historically and currently the second lowest of the underrepresented student population for the UC and UCSB. UCSB was unable to provide a direct statement on this matter.† The UC maintains a summary of undergraduate admissions data from 2014 to 2022 academic years, tracking percentages of each underrepresented group admitted from the entire admitted student population.† Black and American Indigenous admission rates have remained largely flat at UCSB, with Black student admissions staying at 3% from 2014 to 2016, increasing to 4% in 2017, declining to 3% in 2018 and increasing again to 4% in 2021 onwards. American Indigenous admissions remained at 1% from 2014 to 2018, declined to 0% in 2019 and increased again to 1% in 2022.† In contrast, Asian admissions have been between 30% to 34% from 2014 to 2022, increasing and declining by 4% interchangeably between 2019 and 2022. Hispanic admissions experienced a decline from 20% to 18% between 2014 and 2020, then increased up to 23% from 2021 onward. White admissions largely declined over this time span, from 31% in 2014 to 22% in 2022.† UCSB Director of Admission Lisa Przekop noted that because ethnic and gender information is blocked from the view of UCSB admission officers, UCSB Admissions has focused its growth in ethnic diversity to maintain a diverse applicant pool through outreach strategies. Przekop said some of UCSB Admissions' outreach efforts toward increasing the diversity of its student population include visiting over 1,000 high schools and community colleges annually, bringing schools from low-income areas of Los Angeles to UCSB's campus, outreach to non-profit organizations and peer advising.† ""Changing the demographics of a major university like UC Santa Barbara does not happen overnight,""ù she said in a statement to the Nexus. ""Admissions has dedicated outreach resources for many years that have allowed us to reach HSI status and to continue to grow the campus diversity. ""Diversity does not just mean ethnic diversity. We are strategic in also trying to reach different parts of the state including rural areas and will continue these efforts moving forward.""ù There also was an increase of domestic nonresidents by 3.9% and of international students by 1%. Overall, domestic nonresident admissions declined by 19% and international student admissions declined by 12.2% between 2021 and 2022.† ""While the overall applicant pool dropped slightly this year due to a small decline in non-resident applicants, our pool of California applicants actually grew so we had more outstanding California students in the pool to fill our class,""ù Przekop said. ""Again, long-term outreach strategies have maintained a strong California applicant pool.""ù Cumulatively, the number of freshman admits from underrepresented groups increased by 4%, or by 1,494 students, in comparison to 2022.† ""We accepted more freshmen because the transfer applicant pool was slightly lower therefore our overall enrollment targets shifted. We're also seeing students apply to more campuses so we may have fewer admitted students actually accepting our offer because they have so many choices,""ù she said in the statement. ""Lastly, as our more competitive sister campuses UCLA, Berkeley and UC San Diego admit more students, that will result in UC Santa Barbara taking more students off our waitlists ""î our models have to account for these changes.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the August 24, 2023, print edition of the Daily Nexus.

data,UCSB releases 2022-23 course grades,1-Sep-23,9:30 AM,['Siddharth Chattoraj'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-09-01/ucsb-releases-2022-23-course-grades/,"From summer 2022 through spring 2023, 58.34% of course letter grades awarded were A's, according to data obtained by the Nexus from the UC Santa Barbara Office of the Registrar via a Public Records Act Request.† The proportion of ""A""ù grades had generally been increasing slightly from 2012 to 2019, but it rose by approximately nine percentage points during the 2019-20 school year ""î the spring of which was entirely remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion has remained steady since. This data ""î along with individual grades by course and instructor from the past 15 years obtained through prior requests ""î is published and visualized on the Daily Nexus Grades Search website. 



 The data provided by the UCSB Office of the Registrar represents the original grades awarded by the instructor for each course before pass/no pass (P/NP) or satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) conversions were accounted for. The P/NP and S/U grades included in the data are only from courses that do not award letter grades.† If a student chooses a P/NP or S/U grading option for a course with optional grading, instructors will assign pass grades for undergraduate coursework equivalent to a C or better, according to Academic Services' Associate Registrar Sara Cook. Satisfactory grades will be assigned for graduate coursework equivalent to a B or better.† ""For optionally graded courses, instructors do not know what grading option enrolled students have chosen. They assign a letter grade to all students and then the grade is converted to P/NP or S/U based on the grading option chosen by the student,""ù Cook said. ""A""ù grades are awarded for work deemed ""excellent,""ù according to Section 2, Regulation 20 of the UCSB Academic Senate Regulations of the Division. ""B""ù grades are awarded for ""good""ù work, ""C""ù grades for ""adequate""ù work, ""D""ù grades for ""barely passing work""ù and ""F""ù grades for ""not passing work.""ù ""A""ù, ""B""ù, ""C""ù and ""D""ù grades may be modified with ""+""ù or ""-""ù suffixes.† Beyond the guidelines outlined in the Senate's Regulations of the Division, instructors have the right to determine their course grading policies. ""The Senate does not predetermine what the distribution of the grades should be in any course. That is left to the judgment and discretion of the instructor,""ù the UCSB Academic Affairs Division said in a statement to the Nexus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, grading was more forgiving, and that trend has continued through the 2022-23 school year. ""Professors were more lenient during COVID with their grading across the board, so they would round up or put things a little higher during COVID,""ù Liz Phillips, president of the UCSB Physics Discord server, website chair for Undergraduate Diversity and Inclusion in Physics and fourth-year physics major, said. The UCSB Academic Affairs Division is currently working to improve its understanding of course grading and student learning in the context of the pandemic. ""Remote education presented challenges, including in the administration of exams. As we emerge from three years of challenges for both faculty and students and faculty, we plan to work with the Academic Senate to improve our understanding of grading practices in the context of our extensive efforts to monitor and assess Student Learning Outcomes,""ù the Division said.† ""As part of our campus re-accreditation process, we are studying the experience and enrollment trends of students in large undergraduate majors. Understanding student learning outcomes and working with faculty on both pedagogical and assessment practices has been a major focus and is ongoing,""ù they added. The proportion of A's at UCSB has never dropped below 55% since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In the 2022-23 school year, the average departmental (percentage within a department) percentage of A+'s, A's and A-'s given was 66%. Furthermore, 59% of letter grades awarded from physics courses were A's. Phillips added that course grading is heavily dependent on the professor. ""I've heard nightmare stories about some professors that will not curve or the class average will be like a forty before they curve, but then other professors are really nice and have a very lenient grading scale,""ù they said. Derek Younger ""î a third-year actuarial science major and the Professional Development Director of the UCSB Actuarial Association ""î said that he has experienced multiple types of curves, including grade ""bump-ups""ù for the entire class and curves designed to specifically help people struggling in the class. His professor for Transition to Data Science, Probability and Statistics (PSTAT 8) curved the class by prioritizing raising the grades of those who had lower marks.† ""What they did was they, I believe, square-rooted the grade and then multiplied by 10, so it looked like not a straight linear curve but more like a regression curve,""ù he said. ""If you were say a sixty percent, you'd jump up a lot more compared to a ninety percent.""ù† Only 47% of letter grades awarded from courses offered by the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability were A's. The Department of Military Science and the Department of Biomolecular Science and Engineering awarded only A's for letter-graded courses in the 2022-23 school year, and 100% of all letter grades awarded were either A+'s, A's or A-'s. The UCSB Jewish Studies program awarded the highest departmental proportion of A+'s ""î 37.5% ""î for its Hebrew courses. The Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology awarded the most A+'s ""î 2864 ""î out of all academic departments. The Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry awarded the lowest percentage of A's and the highest percentage of C's and D's for its chemistry courses among all academic departments at UCSB.† The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry did not respond to multiple requests for an explanation of their grading policy. The Department of Political Science awarded the highest percentage of B's ""î 41.2%. Of the 4385 letter grades given, 1831 were either B+'s, B's or B-'s. The department does not dictate to professors how to grade their courses. ""We do not have a departmental policy regarding how instructors manage grades. We do review grading results and discuss with professors unusually high or unusually low grades""ù, Kathleen Bruhn, professor and chair of the Department of Political Science, said in a statement to the Nexus. Siddharth Chattoraj / Daily Nexus Younger believes that grades do not matter much in terms of one's chance at becoming an actuary. ""All you have to do is just pass tests and then demonstrate some sort of leadership or some initiative in pushing the actuary profession around the school and getting more people to notice it,""ù he said. ""Fundamentally, it just is about passing tests. If you can pass the tests outside of the school, then you will become an actuary.""ù On the other hand, Phillips said that grades are especially important for those who want to pursue graduate studies because admission to graduate school is competitive due to the limited number of spots available ""î especially in physics ""î for undergraduates.† ""The physics department here is very grad school oriented,""ù they added. ""It's very ""òmake sure you have your letters of [recommendation]. Make sure your grades are good.' A lot of people just assume that you're applying to grad school.""ù However, Phillips said that a lot of physics majors at UCSB end up pursuing non-physics careers in industry rather than attending graduate school. † ""I think a lot of physics majors end up going into software engineering or finance, but if you want to specifically stay in physics, a Ph.D. is usually what people go for ""¶ I think that more than half of undergrad physics majors don't go to grad school,""ù they said. With regard to potential changes Phillips and Younger would like to see in how courses are graded, both agreed that the current system did not have many issues. Younger did recommend adding more sections and slightly increasing the weight of homework, rather than that of exams. ""Doing the homework and then going to the sections or the office hours ""î that's what makes me learn the most, and for me, I assume that it is similar [for] other people too,""ù he said. ""But other than that, the grading scale, I have no issues with it.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the Aug. 24, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

data,UCSB baseball players reflect on their summer league experiences,5-Oct-23,7:46 PM,"['Siddharth Chattoraj', 'Michelle Tekawy']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-05/ucsb-baseball-players-reflect-on-their-summer-league-experiences/,"In the wake of a challenging 2023 baseball season that saw UC Santa Barbara secure sixth place in the Big West Conference, a significant portion of the team turned their attention to summer leagues spanning across the United States and Canada. UC Santa Barbara finished in sixth place out of 11 teams in the Big West Conference in 2023, after winning 18 games and losing 12. After the baseball season ended, many Gauchos continued playing in summer league baseball for two to three months across the continent to develop their skills.† 24 UCSB baseball players ""î out of the 44 on the team ""î played baseball this summer. 55% of the UCSB baseball team played summer baseball in 2023. (Michelle Tekawy and Mina Orlic / Daily Nexus) Players are usually assigned to summer league teams based on where their coaches believe they will grow the most. ""Last year, I didn't have a choice of where to go. I was just told that I was going to be playing summer ball in Canada early on in the fall last year, and so I went. I got really lucky. In other leagues, like the Cape Cod [Baseball] League, there's definitely more of an extensive recruiting process,""ù Skyler Chang, a sophomore statistics and data science major who played second base and utility infielder for the Edmonton Riverhawks in Canada over the summer, said. The baseball coaches at UCSB have contacts with summer baseball coaches and they are usually able to help place their players in leagues that would best contribute to their development. ""It's all networking. The UCSB coaches have an idea where they want the players to play, and they reach out to the summer ball coaches,""ù Zander Darby, a junior statistics and data science major who played third base and first base for the Yarmouth""ìDennis Red Sox in the Cape Cod League in Massachusetts this summer, said.† ""Summer ball has different leagues around the country and players from different teams all over the country come together to play on a team. Each league has its own prestige and level, so players go to the leagues best fit for them.""ù† Zander Darby (#12) celebrates reaching first base during a summer baseball game. (Courtesy of Zachary Foley) Some players ""î if they are skilled and experienced enough ""î are invited to play in top leagues. ""The top summer ball league is the Cape Cod [Baseball] League,""ù Matt Ager, a junior economics and accounting major who played pitcher for the USA Baseball Collegiate National Team this summer, said. ""In order to play in the Cape you have to prove yourself during a season and get invited to play there.""ù UCSB baseball players played in six summer leagues in 2023. 11 played in the West Coast League, which contains 16 summer baseball clubs. *N/A refers to ""Not Applicable""ù since Matt Ager played for the United States Collegiate National Baseball Team, which plays against international teams rather than summer league teams. (Michelle Tekawy and Mina Orlic / Daily Nexus) Players may also end up skipping summer ball altogether, especially due to injury concerns. ""Some people decide not to because of the load it puts on your body and arm. You might need that break if you pitched a lot during the season or if something is a minor injury that you want to heal,""ù Ager said. Nevertheless, players have a variety of reasons for playing summer baseball. ""Some players do it for recruitment; some have stand-out years and are invited to the Cape Cod [Baseball] League or one of the other top leagues, where scouts are in the stands at every game. Others play summer ball to get reps in ""¶ like most freshmen for example,""ù Chang said. The majority of UCSB summer baseball players are underclassmen. 10 sophomores and 8 freshmen from UCSB played summer baseball in 2023. (Michelle Tekawy and Mina Orlic / Daily Nexus) A majority of UCSB's summer baseball players played for teams on the West Coast of the United States or Canada. Five players played for California teams, and five played for Washington teams ""î the most out of all other states and provinces. Four players out of the 24 summer UCSB baseball players played for teams in Canada. Only four players, three of whom played in the Cape Cod Baseball League in Massachusetts, played summer baseball on the East Coast. The other player ""î Ager ""î primarily played in North Carolina since that was where the United States Collegiate National Baseball Team was based.  Once players leave UCSB for their summer teams, each player is assigned a host family to stay with. ""Host families range anywhere from young families with kids to old couples with no young children in the house,""ù Darby said. Darby and Ager reflected fondly on their experiences staying with their host families.† ""My host mom's name was Mary Jane, and it was just her and me. It was only her third year hosting and she had Y-D Red Sox memorabilia all over her house. She had signed balls, bats and pictures,""ù Darby said. ""They took me in and treated me like one of their own kids,""ù Ager said. Chang shared that his host family welcomed him into their home and provided him with whatever he needed during his time with them. ""My host parents, James and Vanessa Derry, were so welcoming to me. They were just normal people that kept on living their lives even with a stranger in their home,""ù Chang said. ""Their home had everything I needed and more: they had a piano for me to learn new songs on and also an underground bar. Every week, or whenever I asked, they'd get me groceries and such.""ù The relationship between a host family and a player can last long after the season ends. Jessada Brown, a junior sociology major who played as an outfielder for the Victoria HarbourCats in Canada over the summer, said that he still remains in close contact with his host family. ""It's completely out of the kindness of their heart to do it and it's a great experience for both the player and the family. A lot of times you make a lasting bond with them,""ù Brown said. ""My host family from when I was going into the freshman year in Medford, Oregon still keeps in contact with Matt [Ager] and me and will text us after games as well as send us letters.""ù Jessada Brown (left) poses for a picture with his host mom and teammate after a HarbourCats game. (Courtesy of Jessada Brown) Players rely on their host families for support during the season, which can be quite packed. The summer baseball season is more densely scheduled than the UCSB baseball season, where games are usually played four days a week ""î Friday, Saturday, Sunday and one weekday between Monday and Thursday. ""During summer ball, it's literally just games. In the WCL ""î West Coast League ""î where I played this summer, it was six games a week with a rest day on Monday,""ù Chang said. ""I had never played so much baseball in my life, but it was super enjoyable. It's busier baseball-wise, but there's no school so the days go by quickly because you're having so much fun.""ù Unlike the regular season, when there are days devoted specifically to practice, there is not much time to practice during the summer baseball season due to the heavy game load. ""Since you are playing 6-7 days out of the week, there aren't practice days. You get your practice in before games,""ù Brown said. ""A typical day for me during summer ball would be: wake up around 9:30 and make breakfast, be at the gym from 10:30 to 12:30 make lunch and then be at the field around 2:00 to hit and do other early work such as fly balls or catching work. Game time [was] at 6:35 and then [I'd] go to bed around 12,""ù Brown added. Darby had a similarly full schedule throughout the summer season, but he was also taking classes, leaving little room for downtime. ""For home games, I showed up to the field at around 1:00. From 1:00 to 2:00, I would do hitting drills and infield drills voluntarily with my coaches. At 2:00 we stretched and did batting practice and eventually got ready for the game at 4:30. The game would go until 7:30 or 8:00,""ù Darby said. ""I would also go to the gym in the mornings, so I would barely have time to do class. There weren't any practices.""ù Chang's schedule was also busy, but he was able to find moments to unwind while eating lunch daily with his team and greeting fans after each game.† Despite the long days, players were still able to find time to relax. Ager said he was able to unwind by spending time with his friends at night. †""I would typically get home around 11 p.m., and then I would eat dinner and play video games with my friends until 1 to 2 a.m., and then do it again the next day,""ù he said. Matt Ager (right) watches the fireworks with his teammates on the Fourth of July. (Courtesy of Matt Ager) The summer baseball culture is more relaxed than that of regular-season baseball, according to Ager.† ""It is common to see people either trying out new positions or just messing around in different positions,""ù Ager said. ""I played third and a little bit of first. It can most definitely be different. I never played first before, but I did this past summer. One of my teammates was the starting second baseman for Vanderbilt and he played outfield for us,""ù Darby said. ""I played all outfield this summer, but at school, I am a catcher as well,""ù Brown said. ""I played in what felt like a place and environment where winning wasn't as important as my development and just getting reps,""ù Chang said. ""Our coach emphasized having fun and enjoying the moment, win or loss, and appreciating the fans that came out to watch.""ù Skyler Chang (#9) celebrates a victory with a Gatorade cooler bath. (Courtesy of Skyler Chang) And while players might have a great season over the summer, it has little to no effect on their spot on the university team, according to Darby. ""Everything is earned at UCSB. Even if you have a good summer, you still have to perform as you would to earn a spot,""ù Darby said. Nevertheless, summer baseball still has the potential to impact a player's regular season performance. ""You could get hurt playing, and it would mess up your season if you don't heal it right, or you could have a really good summer and play well and carry that momentum into the fall season and then ultimately the actual season,""ù Ager said. ""We have a full fall season where we scrimmage ourselves and that is where the lineup is made. Summer ball is for self-development.""ù Beyond skill development and exploring new positions, players have the chance to create lasting memories during summer baseball.† ""You play with a bunch of guys from different parts of the country and different schools, so you make lasting connections with people you wouldn't usually meet,""ù Brown said.† Chang said that summer baseball felt like a vacation with his friends. ""It was an amazing experience exploring new cities all across western Canada all while being able to improve my baseball skills at the same time,""ù he added. Ager and Darby both shared that their favorite moments from the summer season involved spending time with their summer teammates. ""My favorite memory this past summer would be playing Nintendo Switch with my new teammates in our hotel room and just getting to know all these different guys from across the U.S.,""ù Ager said. ""My favorite memory from playing summer ball is cooking dinner and watching movies together after games with my teammates,""ù Darby said. Darby is undecided on whether he plans to play summer baseball in 2024. Brown, Ager and Chang all said they would play again if given the opportunity.† A version of this article appeared on p. 12 and p.13 of the Oct. 5, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

data,"Isla Vista law enforcement response in October 2023, summarized",2-Nov-23,11:00 AM,['Asumi Shuda'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-02/isla-vista-law-enforcement-response-in-october-2023-summarized/,"The Nexus compiled a summary of crimes recorded by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office in Isla Vista from Oct. 1 to Oct. 30.† I.V. is under jurisdiction of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department and Isla Vista Foot Patrol, a branch of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. Angelina Song / Daily Nexus  The data was obtained from the October 2023 Arrest Log folder that is provided by Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office Crime Analyst Elisabeth Nybo.† I.V. ""î and the neighboring UC Santa Barbara campus ""î is under jurisdiction of the UC Santa Barbara Police Department and Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP), a branch of Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office's (SBSO). There were 13 categories of misdemeanors and six categories of felonies recorded between Oct. 1 and Oct. 30, with a total of 34 misdemeanor and six felony offenses logged by SBSO.† There were two types of misdemeanor possession offenses recorded and four issued charges: three charges of minor in possession and one charge of possession of marijuana in a vehicle.† The logs included five misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence, obstructing a public officer and disorderly conduct under the influence, all of which were the most common offenses listed.† More vehicle-related offenses included driving without a license, minor operating a vehicle and tampering with a vehicle, each of which had one charge recorded.† Other misdemeanor offenses include three charges of presenting false identification, two charges of carrying an open container, two charges each for receiving and theft of stolen property and two charges each for vandalism and loitering.† The ""open container""ù charge ""î a Santa Barbara County ordinance that bans open containers from public areas ""î has historically gained attention in Isla Vista, with IVFP conducting a ""No Open Container""ù campaign in Fall Quarter 2022 to educate residents about the policy.† There were six categories of felony charges recorded: inflicting corporal injury to a spouse or inhabitant, possession and sale of narcotics, possession of controlled substances, first degree burglary, second degree burglary and carrying a dirk or dagger.

data,The best time to hit the books: Exploring occupancy trends in the UCSB Library,3-Nov-23,8:00 AM,"['Grace Nunnelley', 'Julia Ong']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-03/the-best-time-to-hit-the-books-exploring-occupancy-trends-in-the-ucsb-library/,"What comes to mind when the UC Santa Barbara Library is mentioned? Perhaps the view from the eighth floor or the clamor of students walking through the Paseo on their way to class. But for most, it is a place to study. There are several study areas on each floor with a variety of seating, such as cubicles and large tables. This variation allows students to find certain study areas more conducive to productivity. Yet, the eight floors and several study areas become especially busy during specific weeks of the quarter, often aligning with midterm and finals season.† ""During finals, it's hard for me to find places to study because I normally prefer getting the [standing] desks,""ù 2023 communication graduate Jude Bangsal said. ""I try to switch up: two hours sitting and then an hour standing up. So if it's finals week or dead week, it's just impossible to get those.""ù In response to student feedback on the issue of finding available space in the UCSB Library, the library staff took the initiative to figure out an effective way to advise students about the library's occupancy at a given time. ""Library staff investigated various products and determined that Waitz would be the best solution,""ù Johannes Steffens ""î the UCSB Library's communications and marketing manager ""î said.† Waitz is an application developed by Occuspace ""î a company founded by UC San Diego graduates ""î that updates in real-time to inform students about the occupancy of different areas in the library. There are multiple screens displaying the Waitz dashboard located around the library, notably one on the first floor past the services desk.† Since then, Occuspace's technology has been used in library plans for staff management, cleaning schedules and renovations, in addition to tracking available study space. ""Typically, our customers use our historical data to assess space utilization over time, empowering them to make data-driven operational decisions,""ù Nic Halverson ""î chief executive officer of Occuspace ""î said.† For the UCSB Library, where the majority of visitors are students, the utility of Waitz is simple: finding an uncrowded study area. Steffens has collected anonymous responses from students since the implementation of Waitz. ""Waitz is kind of the best thing to happen to the library in a long time,""ù one student wrote. Usage of the Waitz app and website has steadily increased since its adoption by the library. ""We've seen triple the number of new visitors to the Waitz site and Waitz app downloads this January compared to the previous year, indicating more students are using the Waitz data to plan their library visits and better navigate crowds,""ù Steffens added.† To collect occupancy data, Waitz sensors are located throughout the library. Using anonymized Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal data, the sensors estimate the number of people nearby. The Waitz data provides the average hourly occupancy of all library floors. The library staff occasionally validate the Waitz data by manually conducting counts of people in the library. According to Halverson, Occuspace sensor technology has been proven to be over 93% accurate.† The UCSB Library Building Operations (B.O.P.S.) also tracks library occupancy and provided counts of average occupancy from 2021-23 and gate counts ""î the number of people who walk through the library doors ""î from 2016-23. The chart displays the number of visitors to the library over the past academic year, broken down by week. There are peaks during Weeks 4 and 10 as well as drops during Week 7, 9 and finals. The low numbers of Week 9 during Fall Quarter 2022 and the high numbers of Week 10 are likely due to the Thanksgiving holiday and dead week ""î the week before finals ""î respectively. (Grace Nunnelley/ Daily Nexus) The overall trend in number of occupants over these seven quarters is consistent with UCSB's reopening and COVID-19 protocols; people were likely still cautious about studying in public spaces during the 2021-22 academic year. This is especially seen in the decrease in popularity during Winter Quarter 2022, when the quarter was partially conducted with remote instruction due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant. (Grace Nunnelley/ Daily Nexus) The library's occupancy still has not returned to its pre-pandemic level: about 2 million visited in 2022-23 compared to about 2.5 million visiting in 2018-19. There are also slightly fewer visitors in each spring quarter, which is possibly due to a small percentage of students graduating early at the end of winter quarter. The data from B.O.P.S. was a somewhat less accurate representation of the library's popularity because this data also included people passing through the Paseo area. However, the overall trends are similar to the Waitz data.† The Waitz dashboard also provided the hourly occupancy of each area of the library between September 2021 and June 2023. The data covers the following floors: 1st Floor Mountain Side, 1st Floor Ocean Side, Art & Architecture (on the first floor), 2nd Floor Mountain Side, 2nd Floor Ocean Side, 4th Floor, 5th Floor, 6th Floor, 7th Floor and 8th Floor (the third floor of the library contains no study space).† The graphic displays the library divided into areas for the purpose of categorizing the data from Waitz. (Julia Ong / Daily Nexus) The first and second floors are the most popular of all the library floors. The fifth to eighth floors are ""quiet floors,""ù and the overall number of daily visitors reflects that these floors are mainly used as study spaces. The eighth floor is the most popular quiet floor because of the Pacific View Room ""î a study space behind the elevators with a view of the southern part of campus. The chart displays the cumulative sum of visitors between September 2021 and June 2023 of each library floor by hour. (Grace Nunnelley/ Daily Nexus ) ""The eighth floor is supposed to be quiet, but it's not because people just think it's so much fun ""î they want to see the views. It's just never been quiet,""ù Bangsal said.† The data reflects that the fifth to seventh floors consistently have fewer occupants despite being similar in size to the eighth floor. The chart ""Popular times of the week to visit the library by quarter""ù displays the cumulative sum of library visitors by hour for each quarter. (Grace Nunnelley / Daily Nexus) The library rapidly fills up between the hours of 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., making 3 p.m. the peak of popularity across all floors. Although there are still a significant number of occupants staying past the library's closing time due to late night study, most occupants do not stay past 3 a.m.† To beat the crowds, Bangsal used to visit the library group study rooms late at night with his friends. ""We would stay there [from] midnight 'til sunrise. And we would go out to see the sunrise,""ù he said. The heatmap displays the mean number of total visitors to the library between September 2021 and June 2023 relative to weekday and hour. (Grace Nunnelley / Daily Nexus) Katy Costantinidis ""î the UCSB Library building operations assistant ""î also said that study spaces usually fill up between 2-4 p.m. on weekdays.† ""There is a noticeable decrease in building occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays as well as before 11 a.m. and after 7 p.m. each day,""ù she said.† The least popular days to spend in the library are Saturdays and Sundays. There is a sharp drop in occupancy toward the end of the week, notably dropping off Fridays between the hours of 5-6 p.m. and increasing slightly again on Sunday as students prepare for the next week of school.† These patterns of library occupancy are somewhat disrupted during the last week of each quarter ""î when final exams occur. Additional staffing is allocated for the custodial team during the weekend between dead week and finals week to supplement the regular cleaning services during the time the library is most crowded, according to Costantinidis.† ""The Building Operations team is particularly mindful to monitor noise on the quiet floors five through eight to ensure the quiet is maintained, particularly during dead week and finals week, when maintaining a quiet environment is of utmost importance to support focused study and academic success,""ù Costantinidis said. Bangsal said he prefers the library to study above other campus study spots. ""It's just the environment, like everyone you can see is working hard. [It gives me] encouragement to study too,""ù Bangsal said. A version of this article appeared on p. 8 and p. 9 of the Nov. 2, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

data,From checkups to coverage: Understanding UCSB's healthcare landscape,18-Jan-24,11:30 AM,"['Kyle Wu', 'Kacie Chong']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-18/from-checkups-to-coverage-understanding-ucsbs-healthcare-landscape/,"UC Santa Barbara's Student Health Service logged a total of 49,197 student visits between Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. On average, each student had 1.9 encounters with SHS during this period. And, the majority of these students were covered under the University of California Student Health Insurance Plan. In the United States, healthcare spending accounts for 17.3% of the GDP, according to official estimates by the National Health Expenditure Accounts for 2022. In the same year, the total healthcare spending amongst the American population was $4.5 trillion, equaling an average of $13,493 spent per person. However, as one of the primary sources of healthcare for UCSB students, Student Health Service (SHS) makes a wide range of medical services readily accessible to students. ""We provide full spectrum primary care, behavioral health, physical therapy, pharmacy, laboratory, and x-ray services. We also provide free access to social workers, nurse consultation and the Alcohol and Drug program for all students regardless of having UC SHIP, which is unique to student health compared to other healthcare systems in the area,""ù said fourth-year biological sciences major and Student Advisor to the SHS Executive Director Graci Novack.  SHS data on student visits per quarter from Fall 2021 to Summer 2023 revealed a seasonality trend in visits. Summer quarters experience lower usage volume, likely because there are fewer students present at on campus and in Isla Vista.† Students tend to access Student Health more during the fall and spring quarters compared to the winter and summer quarters and most frequently seek medical attention for the following six reasons: 1) immunization, 2) screenings for sexually transmitted infections, 3) throat pain, 4) dysuria, 5) acute pharyngitis and 6) acute vaginitis.†  All UCSB students are required to be enrolled in a health insurance plan and are automatically enrolled in UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP). Students can choose to opt out of UC SHIP if they already have a comparable private health insurance plan that meets UC requirements. This choice between private health insurance and UC SHIP insurance can present a significant challenge for students as they must weigh various factors such as cost and coverage. UC SHIP was started in 2011 in response to a decision by the UC Regents that made health insurance a non-academic condition for enrollment. In 2018, UCSB became the last UC to participate in UC SHIP because of the advantages it provided students over private insurance, according to Novack.† ""We feel that UC SHIP provides great and affordable coverage for students with benefits that exceed many insurance plans on the market,""ù she said.† Novack added that UC SHIP users get prepaid access to care at the UCSB Student Health Center for any medical situation. ""UC SHIP is an insurance plan that covers visits to the E.R. ($250 copay) and urgent care ($25 copay). UC SHIP also provides dental (Delta Dental Providers), vision (Blue View Vision) and outside pharmacy coverage,""ù she said.† Before 2021, UC SHIP enrollment hovered around 13,000 students but has since surpassed 19,000 students, according to Novack.† ""Increased numbers of students admitted to UCSB and positive publicity regarding the UC SHIP plan are likely variables that have contributed to increased enrollment,""ù she said. ""Students and parents have also learned about the great benefits of UC SHIP and have subsequently decided not to waive the plan.""ù  The typical cost of UC SHIP ""î a platinum plan ""î for undergraduate students is $1,064.00 per quarter, in contrast to the cost of private health insurance plans.† Several factors such as age, location, number of people covered and tier affect the cost of private health insurance plans. Individuals can choose a health plan tier that fits their needs. The bronze plan offers the lowest monthly premium but the highest deductibles and costs an average of $348 per month ""î roughly $860 for 10 weeks. On the other end of the spectrum, the platinum plan is around $454 per month ""î roughly $1047.70 for 10 weeks.†  Students may be eligible for free or lower-cost UC SHIP covered by the UC Health Insurance Grant, which may be noted on the financial aid letter.† However, UC SHIP still has limitations compared to private health insurance plans.† ""I experienced a major fracture in my foot during an intramural basketball game at night. Student Health was closed, so I went straight to Cottage Hospital Emergency. The E.R. was not fully covered by UC SHIP, and I had to pay a copayment,""ù UCSB second-year communication major Chloe Choi, who is currently enrolled in UC SHIP said.  Additionally, to see a specialist, there is a UC SHIP referral requirement. Students must get a referral from SHS to get medical care if they are within a 50-mile radius of campus. However, according to Student Health Service, the referral requirement excludes ""emergency room care, urgent care clinics, pediatric care, obstetrics services, gynecological care, Lyra Health, and Live Health Online virtual visits.""ù† Choi said that she had to request a referral from Student Health to make an orthopedic appointment.† ""The ER referred me to an orthopedic specialist in Santa Barbara, but for me to get an appointment with them, I needed a referral from Student Health,""ù she said. ""The processing time usually takes a couple of days. I called student health† to get it sooner since my appointment was the next day, and they were very helpful.""ù† The Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) document available on the SHS website can help students choose an insurance plan that fits their medical goals. The SBC explains how a health insurance plan would share the cost of covered health care services.† Olivia Nguyen contributed reporting.

data,Data sheds light on what COVID-19 is like for inmates at CDCR institutions,18-Jan-24,9:00 AM,"['Nicole Xu', 'Collin Tran', 'Sophia Zhu']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-18/data-sheds-light-on-what-covid-19-is-like-for-inmates-at-cdcr-institutions/,"After almost four years, COVID-19 has become the newest normal in daily life. While many have adjusted to this change accordingly, data shows that thousands currently incarcerated at the 33 adult institutions managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and its effects. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is the law enforcement agency in charge of operating California's prisons and parole systems. As of 2023, the department is responsible for 33 adult correctional institutions, 13 adult community correctional facilities and 8 juvenile facilities, making it the largest state-run prison system in the United States. The total population has been consistently above the design capacity. NICOLE XU / DAILY NEXUS When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in the United States in March of 2020, the CDCR held about 120,000 inmates and employed about 50,000 staff. Due to an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the institutions prioritized the release of nonviolent offenders with less than 60 days in their sentence. The number of people admitted to prisons decreased as well, resulting in the lowest state imprisonment level in 30 years. The population dropped from about 120,000 inmates to around 96,000 inmates.† Yet, CDCR institutions today remain overcrowded and at higher risk for infection. Once COVID-19 protections were removed in 2021, most admissions returned to pre-pandemic levels, making overcrowding a pressing issue once again.† The combined design capacity of all 34 CDCR institutions is 85,330 inmates, but from January to October of 2023, the institutions have had an average capacity rate of 109.5%. The design capacity represents the maximum number of inmates that can be housed with safety, comfort and hygiene in mind, meaning that some concessions had to be made in these areas when the population rose above 100%.† Within the cells, there are limited opportunities for the social distancing required to minimize transmission of COVID-19. The standard cell size is anywhere from 25-35 feet, however, in most, if not all cells, there is more than one inmate. This leaves little room for each inmate to be at least 6 feet from the others in their cell, not including the other amenities such as furniture. With overcrowding and consequent lack of distancing, inmates are much more susceptible to any disease and infection. Coupled with the preexisting conditions that many inmates have, as well as the older demographic of the institutions, inmates are at higher risk than the average Californian to contract COVID-19.† According to California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS), more than 10,000 inmates were treated for hepatitis C in 2018. Approximately 8,000 of California's inmates are diabetic, 12% of male and 20% of female inmates were asthmatic in 2010 and in 2015, 0.8% of California's inmates were HIV positive. These rates are almost double that of the general Californian population. These chronic illnesses especially raise the risk of COVID-19 infection because they target or weaken the respiratory and immune systems.† In order to combat this issue, the CDCR has set a number of guidelines: each facility's housing units are either categorized into outbreak or open phase. In the open phase, the facility is allowed to function as normal while still observing COVID-19 precautions. The goal is to move from the outbreak to the open phase, or to maintain the open phase.† According to the CDCR guidelines, in order to move to the open phase, the unit must have no new incarcerated persons outbreak cases in 14 days. If a housing unit experiences an outbreak, they then revert back to the outbreak phase. Under these guidelines, an outbreak is defined as three or more epidemiologically-linked cases of COVID-19 among incarcerated persons in a period of 14 days. Currently, in the overall CDCR population, there are 14 housing units that are in the outbreak phase and 840 that are in the open phase. Note the logarithmic scale of the # of inmates tested. NICOLE XU / DAILY NEXUS At the height of the pandemic, the CDCR and CCHCS had stricter guidelines in place. However, with the continuous drop in COVID-19 cases in all institutions in recent years and the high vaccination rates among the population throughout the state's prisons, the reopening guidelines have been updated and loosened, according to the CDCR's COVID-19 timeline. Routine surveillance and exposure testing have become voluntary, but all of the institutions continue to test inmates daily, with some prisons testing their entire population in one day.† Despite significant progress having been made in reducing inmate populations as well as implementing health guidelines, institutionalized individuals remain at higher risk for infectious diseases compared to the rest of the population. Unfortunately, the inherent nature of correctional facilities has proven it difficult to mitigate these issues completely. Problems like this have existed prior to COVID-19, and will likely persist for years to come. Nevertheless, moving forward, the CDCR's experience with the COVID-19 pandemic may serve as a valuable lesson in using policy to address public health emergencies at correctional institutions around the world.

data,UCSB's lodging labyrinth: The hunt for housing in Isla Vista,2-Feb-24,8:00 AM,"['Alexandra Chan', 'Kyle Wu', 'Winston Zuo', 'Benjamin Monastyrsky']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-02/ucsbs-lodging-labyrinth-the-hunt-for-housing-in-isla-vista/,"The green house shows words commonly mentioned in positive reviews, while the red house shows words commonly used in negative reviews. The size of the words corresponds to how frequently those words are used. Kyle Wu / Daily Nexus As UC Santa Barbara's winter quarter reaches the halfway mark, students are finding themselves in the hunt for housing. They enter a housing market characterized by rising rent prices, limited unit availability and intense competition.† Since its inauguration as a University of California in the 1940s, UCSB has struggled to maintain enough housing for its growing student population. Like many other Universities of California (UCs), enrollment sizes have continuously increased since the school's founding. In the period since the 2014-15 school year alone, UCSB saw student enrollment increase by more than 3,000. The current student population sits at over 26,000 students as of the fall quarter of the 2023-2024 school year.† Dorms like San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Anacapa and Santa Cruz were constructed to keep up with increased demand. However, unlike other large land-grant universities like UC Santa Cruz and UC San Diego, which have sought to increase the amount of on-campus housing, UCSB allowed private development interests to take the lead, creating what is now Isla Vista. The scramble for housing has intensified, and more students are compelled to search for housing off-campus. ""There's just not enough housing, and the timeline is really difficult. And also it's inaccessible to find a lot of places,""ù Matthew Mucha, the SBCC Relations chair of the Isla Vista Tenants Union, said. In the past few decades, UCSB's housing availability has grown stagnant while the number of students has only grown, with San Joaquin, completed in 2017, being the most recent construction project.† According to Richard Flacks, a retired sociology professor from UCSB and director of the Sustainable University Now (S.U.N.)† coalition, there are consequences in trying to maximize room space.† †""As more people try to inhabit existing space, they're saving some money by doubling and tripling up where they are. But that leads to the stress of overcrowding.""ù  For many students, this often arduous search can become an enormous source of stress.† ""I think that, negatively, it was very stressful. Definitely, like, I feel like the process is a lot to adjust to, like coming from knowing nothing about it,"" Jemma Tolley, a first-year biology major said. Reviews are often left by renters in Isla Vista on websites such as Yelp, Google Reviews, Facebook and Reddit. Of the total number of reviews analyzed, 1207 (50.4%) were considered ""negative""ù or a complaint. Notable words of the most frequent complaints were† ""Management""ù, ""Rent""ù, ""Deposit""ù and ""Fix.""ù†  The ratio of negative reviews to positive reviews appears to peak during July ""î typically when leases end ""î at about 1.7 negative reviews for every positive review.  The rent costs of units have continued to increase as demand for off-campus housing has surged. From 2015 to 2021, the cost of renting a 2-bedroom apartment increased by approximately 34%.† Both the prices students have had to pay over the last decade and the relative cost of housing in Isla Vista compared to some of the surrounding areas of Santa Barbara have increased. According to the City of Santa Barbara, the highest median price for 2-bedroom units of any housing type in 2022 in the Santa Barbara area was $5,750 for Isla Vista. The next closest locality was Montecito, where the median rental price of 2-bedroom units was $5,300. One possible reason for increased housing prices is the cost of land according to Flacks.† ""With housing built on university land, it's much cheaper to build, because the cost of the land is not part of the cost of the housing. Whereas private developed land is much more expensive for housing developers to build.""ù  In addition to students and faculty, other long-term residents also call Isla Vista their home. The issues of increased rents and the lack of housing affect the entire community. Earlier this year, the new owner of CBC & the Sweeps evicted all their tenants in the middle of their leases, driving many to conduct unexpected housing searches. Also, many students often have little to no real-world experience with legal contracts. ""A lot of students just don't know how to read a lease at all. They will read through it and think they know what's legal and what's not.""ù Mucha said. This lack of experience also often adds to the burden felt by students of having to attempt to educate themselves on an often confusing topic. ""I was honestly clueless. Nobody ever told me about how to lease or anything. So my group of me and my friends had to do a lot of research on what was going on. I feel like we were not prepared,""ù Tolley said.† The school has long been aware of the perennial housing crisis and has previously taken steps in an attempt to alleviate the problem. In fact, over a decade ago, the school developed a plan that, if executed on time, would have provided significant housing relief for the community.† In 2010, UCSB released its Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), with stated goals aimed at providing up to 5,000 additional student beds by 2025 and providing housing for an additional 1,600 faculty and staff. As of the publication of this piece, nearly fourteen years after the original plans were made public, the university has encountered setbacks in realizing its vision, particularly evident in previous delays in constructing faculty housing through the Ocean Road project.† Through the construction of San Joaquin and Sierra Madre villages, the university has built housing for 1,500 of the promised 5,000 student beds under the LRDP. To provide the previously promised housing solution on time, UCSB turned to outside sources for solutions, most notably through the conceptualization of Munger Hall ""î partially funded by the late billionaire Charlie Munger.† Munger Hall was initially envisioned as an 11-story, 4,536 bed, mostly windowless dorm spanning over 1.68 million square feet which would have made it the largest dormitory in United States History. However, faced with significant backlash from the community, these plans were quietly scrapped in August 2023 in favor of a call for a more traditional housing solution on two separate sites that would provide up to 3,500 additional beds. ""A committee consisting of faculty members, housing and dining staff, and administrators reviewed proposals and selected two architectural firms. Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill (SOM) of Los Angeles, in association with Mithun of Seattle, have been chosen to design housing on the campus sites identified in the LRDP. The new residences will include dining facilities and common area amenities and will address pedestrian/vehicular circulation,""ù the university spokesperson Kiki Reyes said. The expected completion date of these new projects is now Fall 2027 with the hope that these new dormitories will be a step towards easing the housing crisis for the UCSB community as a whole. Flacks encouraged current UCSB students to stay active and vocal about the current and future state of housing. ""This is a direct interest of students in their daily life, the housing question, and I would hope that students would be really engaged in learning about it and not just thinking it's an individual problem for them individually, but a problem they all share. And that can be changed by their actions.""ù

data,Learning and Large Language Models: Charting ChatGPT's changes to curriculum,8-Feb-24,12:00 PM,"['Calais Waring', 'Megan Dhillon', 'Keya Panchal']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-08/learning-and-large-language-models-charting-chatgpts-changes-to-curriculum/,"Zoe Gonzales / Daily Nexus ChatGPT, OpenAI's artificial intelligence language model, recently marked one year since its public release on Nov. 30, 2022 and has emerged as a transformative force in both technology and academia. At UC Santa Barbara, this influence is particularly evident, with ChatGPT playing an increasingly central role in redefining some course structures and teaching strategies.† ChatGPT has quickly established itself as a versatile and accessible tool in the realm of artificial intelligence. This large language model (LLM) can comprehend and generate human-like text, with its capabilities extending to answering questions, assisting with creative writing, coding and much more.† Trained on a dataset called Common Crawl containing billions of web pages and text, ChatGPT uses text data, written by other people, to produce slightly unique answers based on the given query. For the academic community at UCSB, these features have opened new avenues for both learning and teaching. Brandon Meggerson, a third-year physics major, said that he uses ChatGPT to help study.† ""I use ChatGPT about once per week,""ù he said. ""As a physics major, ChatGPT has been very useful when looking up what a specific theorem or equation is used for, [since] it gives the equation itself along with its common applications and origins.""ù†† However, despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT is not infallible.† ""I have noticed that it's not good at applying the formula to solve problems. ""¶ It would give a correct process for solving the problem but give an incorrect answer. ChatGPT essentially fails to solve any math or physics problems that require critical thinking to solve,""ù Meggerson said. ChatGPT is also used by students from non-S.T.E.M. majors for writing purposes.† Priscila Villegas, a third-year film and media studies major, stated that the majority of her assignments are writing-based and uses ChatGPT for inspiration. ""If I'm having like a brain fart ""¶ and I just can't really think of ideas, I ask ChatGPT, and then it sprouts ideas [for the paper],""ù she said. Some professors have even begun to embrace ChatGPT as a resource for their academic content.† ""[Professors] mostly talk about how to not use it, but I had a class [where] we had to use ChatGPT to write a paper ""¶ you either use ChatGPT or an AI picture generator and tell it to generate something and you analyze what it generated,""ù Villegas said.† Katie Baillargeon, a professor in UCSB's Writing Program who teaches both upper and lower division writing course and recently branched out into faculty writing consultations and workshops, said that she has begun to include ChatGPT in her assignments. ""I have integrated ChatGPT into some early-stage process assignments in a few of my courses as I figure we might as well use it purposefully; I always have a few students simply refuse to do those activities, though, so I give them alternatives.""ù Increasing the percentage that participation or in-class assignments are worth of the final grade have also been an emerging trend for some classes in response to ChatGPT.† Phoebe Choi, a third-year film and media studies major who is also taking history courses this quarter said that many of her classes are placing a value on in-class evaluation.† ""Most classes have implemented more in-class essays or in-class activities so that we can't necessarily use online sources. We have more class discussions and then participation is [graded higher],""ù Choi said.† Choi said that the increased focus on participation is a welcome change for her.† ""Because learning has become so virtual, we're just so used to using the internet and online tools ""¶ In regards to having more participation, I think it's ""¶ a higher quality learning,""ù she said. As of the New Faculty Handbook 2022-2023, there is no mandated requirement for professors to determine a stance on ChatGPT, either integrating it or banning it. Because of the lack of guidelines for ChatGPT's role in academia at this preliminary stage, professors have taken different approaches to addressing the new landscape. Some professors have opted to change the structure of their syllabus to account for the use of ChatGPT. During Fall Quarter 2023, statistics and computer science professor Sharon Solis removed homework assignments from her PSTAT 8 (Transition to Data Science, Probability and Statistics) course after discussing ChatGPT in the academic landscape with her colleagues in the graduate seminar CMPSC 595J: Teaching with Large Language Models.† As a result, the revised syllabus for PSTAT 8 placed more emphasis on the exams. The midterm exam and final exam made up 80% of the final grade with 20% being lecture and section participation activities. ""As we're kind of having these discussions with grad students about all the pros and cons of something like ChatGPT or another large language model, it really came top of mind how prevalent it is, and maybe it makes homeworks invalid like not valuable anymore,""ù Solis said. ""So teaching [PSTAT 8], I thought if homeworks are not valuable anymore, then let's just not even deal with homeworks.""ù However, the lack of homework yielded unforeseen consequences for Solis, who found it challenging to evaluate her students' performance in the class. ""I've really come to kind of change my mind ""¶ because then, first hand experience, students in ""¶ PSTAT 8 didn't get any feedback from us before the midterm exam,""ù Solis said. ""I didn't know personally how students were performing, how students were writing before the midterm exam. So that was really scary on my part for me as an instructor, and I'm sure for students to not get any type of formal feedback, in terms of grading, before an exam.""ù Baillargeon and her colleagues face different circumstances as writing instructors.† ""We've had quarterly workshops and general updates on LLMs from the amazing Dan Frank, along with group discussions on how to best handle the use of ChatGPT, etc., in our courses. There's a wide array of opinions about LLMs in the Writing Program. I think the idea is to equip each of us with information so we can choose how to navigate it in our courses in the ways that feel right to us,""ù she said. ""I've asked students to be honest and clear about if they've used any AI in their work by providing a statement that articulates what they did and how as well as noting anything they discarded as being unhelpful,""ù she states about her own personal response to ChatGPT. ""Transparency is the best policy.""ù Additionally, due to the utilization of specifications grading, Baillargeon says she has not had to adjust her grading policies. Although adapting to ChatGPT through trial and error can be difficult at times, Solis said she is determined to adjust to the existence of the new tool.† ""I'm really grateful to be part of the seminar because I think the more me as an educator, I can understand the landscape that my students are coming from the tools that are accessible to students, the better I'm able to kind of come to terms with that and then understand and then try to maybe acknowledge those tools exist,""ù Solis said. Professors also have faced academic dishonesty issues with ChatGPT. The office of the Executive Vice Chancellor issued a memo titled ""Guidance Regarding AI-Writing Assistance Technologies""ù on May 1, 2023 to Senate Faculty and Unit 18 Faculty (which include lecturers and supervisors of teacher education) that discussed UCSB's stance on AI-writing assistance technologies and how to address the use of such technologies within the classroom. The points include ethical use of AI technologies for plagiarism detection, organizing class structures to ""avoid issues with student use of AI-assistive technologies""ù and how to incorporate LLMs into courses. The memo stated that plagiarism detection software is not supported by UCSB because of the lack of accuracy. Faculty are encouraged to design writing assignments to involve LLMs through prompt generating and comparison activities or ""require personal reflection or creative thinking""ù to steer students away from unethical use of AI-assistive technologies.† Baillargeon comments on these plagiarism detection services stating, ""The thing is that any of those ""òdetectors' are bunk, as far as I know. I've had students tell me they were erroneously accused in other [non-writing] classes, and they were pretty distraught about the whole thing because how can you disprove it?""ù In regards to unauthorized student use of LLMs, the memo stated that ""the use of AI writing technologies falls within the purview of the Student Conduct Code and the Student Guide to Academic Integrity""ù and encourages faculty to report instances of such cases. ""The statement was drafted by Office of Teaching and Learning instructional consultants (who regularly work with faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students on issues related to teaching and learning) in consultation with the Office of Student Conduct. It was drafted following two workshops with faculty, students, and staff to explore the underlying structures of implications of Large Language Models,""ù the UCSB Office of Teaching and Learning (OTL) said in a statement to the Nexus. The UCSB Office of Student Conduct outlines categories on their website of academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism, furnishing false information, unauthorized collaboration and misuse of course materials. ChatGPT is explicitly mentioned under the larger umbrella category of cheating, defined as the ""unauthorized use of artificial-intelligence programs (e.g., ChatGPT) to complete course work.""ù† However, ChatGPT is still in its early stages.† ""UCSB's AI policies will doubtless change going forward. AI and Large Language Models are becoming more proficient by the day,""ù the OTL said. †""I think banning the use of LLMs will be hard since it is difficult to tell the difference between human and LLM response,""ù Ambuj Singh, computer science professor in charge of the graduate seminar CMPSC 595J: Teaching with Large Language Models, said. Singh is optimistic about the usage of LLMs in university education in the future.† ""The nature of the courses and the assignments will likely change but LLMs like ChatGPT will allow students to focus more on problem solving,""ù Singh said.† According to Singh, professors, students and universities must be ready to adapt to the next generation's academic landscape, especially due to rapidly emerging methods of using ChatGPT in educational contexts.† ""There will likely not be a single path. Every course may have a different learning outcome. We need to experiment,""ù Singh said. Baillargeon reiterates the sentiment.† ""It's an ever-evolving situation, so what I'm saying to you here may not apply six months from now ""¶ I hope the longer term impact is that students can use it to save time on lower-level cognitive work, which then would mean they can devote time and brain space to more complex cognitive tasks.""ù Even with the increasing use of LLMs, the OTL asserted that ""[LLMs] cannot critically analyze contexts and situations; they cannot connect peoples' identities and commitments to core disciplinary concepts; they cannot build relationships, engage in group work or motivate agency for change. These are skills and dispositions that people bring.""ù†

data,Play like a Gaucho: UCSB women athletes celebrate National Girls and Women in Sports Day,9-Feb-24,11:44 PM,"['Michelle Tekawy', 'Katy Tseng']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-09/play-like-a-gaucho-ucsb-womenathletes-celebrate-national-girls-and-women-in-sports-day/,"Feb. 7, 2024 marked the 38th annual National Girls & Women in Sports Day. As of the 2023-2024 school year, 184 women athletes represent the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos in the Big West and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. National Girls & Women in Sports Day (NGWSD) was founded and first celebrated by the Women's Sports Foundation in 1987. Women athletes, ranging from young girls to older adults, are celebrated nationwide for their inspiration as well as passion for their sports and physical activity.† At UCSB, women athletes are spread out across the 10 sports (tennis, volleyball, swimming, track and field ""î indoor and outdoor ""î cross country, softball, basketball, water polo and soccer) offered by the Intercollegiate Athletics program. Similarly, the men's athletics program also offers 10 sports. While the men's program has a golf team, the women's side makes up for it with their indoor track team.†  While the UCSB athletes are committed to their primary sport at UCSB, many grew up as multi-sports athletes until ultimately finding their perfect fit.† ""I have played many different sports including swimming, soccer, basketball, volleyball, rock climbing and tennis. But the main sports throughout my life have been swimming, rock climbing and water polo,""ù Logan Tiska, the potential biology major and freshman water polo goalkeeper from Sacramento, California, said. Likewise, senior Manuri Alwis ""î a Folsom, California native ""î on the women's soccer team was also exposed to many sports because of how energetic she was at a young age.† ""My mom signed me up for soccer, basketball and gymnastics because I was an energy ball that needed an outlet,""ù Alwis said. Alyssa Marin, who is a senior sociology major and basketball player from Camarillo, California, said that her love and advocacy for women's sports brought her to play basketball.† Logan Tiska poses for her first media day photoshoot with UCSB. (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) Marin was instantly drawn to not UCSB's women's basketball team because of the coaches and staff, who were the foundational backbone of the program. ""UCSB's women's basketball program was a family. They treated their players with respect and made me feel at home while I was being recruited,""ù Marin said. ""The women on this team support one another and lift each other up.""ù† Additionally, athletes say that women representation in coaching at UCSB plays a role in shaping their athletes' collegiate development.† ""Our staff is mostly made up of women which is a huge deal to the players and I. Being able to see women in power who can lead and support the people around them is very special,""ù Marin said. ""I have benefited greatly from being surrounded by women in power because it shows the possibilities for the future for women in sports.""ù Alyssa Marin (left) steals the ball from her opponent mid-game against California State University, Long Beach. (Courtesy of Alyssa Marin) Athletes also said that having women coaches and staff with extensive years of both playing and coaching experience is also beneficial because it brings a profound understanding in how girls and women play sports.† Tiska also highlighted the leadership of their three women coaches on the women's water polo team as crucial to the players' understanding and experiences with the nuances of the game specific to women athletes. ""All three of our coaches are women and it helps a lot because men and women's water polo are similar but have a lot of differences. Having coaches that have played in that game and understand how girls will grab your suit or scratch you is really helpful,""ù Tiska said.† Alwis also reflected on her relationship with Claire Stovall ""î the Assistant Athletic Trainer ""î who helps provide a comfortable space for discussions, enhancing the overall well-being of the team.† While Alwis feels supported by her team and her coaches, she says, being a woman of color in collegiate athletics has been a hardship.†††""I grew up not seeing a lot of athletes who looked like me,""ù Alwis said. ""There is a certain stereotype for South Asians to be very study-driven and I found myself having somewhat of an identity crisis growing up and playing soccer at the competitive level.""ù Manuri Alwis regroups with her teammates on the field in her game against UC San Diego. (Courtesy of Jeff Liang) According to the Women's Sports Foundation, women athletes of color are grossly absent from sports such as lacrosse, golf, swimming, field hockey, softball, tennis and soccer ""î the sport that has seen the greatest increase in participation and sponsorship since Title IX was implemented. Title IX is a federal law that gives women athletes equal opportunities to participate in educational institutions, sports and funding regardless of race and gender. For Tiska, promoting equality in sports means challenging the higher standards imposed on women involved in athletics.† ""I think it's the fact that women are held to a higher standard of looking and acting like an ideal student athlete. I think a small action would be to promote the average woman student athlete and highlight all that she does in addition to her sport,""ù Tiska said. Despite encountering divergent circumstances compared to her peers, Alwis was able to overcome that barrier by leveraging her resilience, determination and skills in time management to excel both on the soccer field and in the classroom. Alwis just finished her fourth and last season with the women's soccer team and will be graduating this spring with a Bachelor of Science degree in statistics and data science. She hopes to leave a legacy that inspires younger girls to feel confident in their sports. ""I hope that younger girls who look like me ""î or don't ""î see me and are empowered to play sports without being afraid of what society or their peers think,""ù Alwis said. Tiska encouraged young girls aspiring to become athletes that obstacles ""î others doubting their capabilities or overlooking their potential ""î may arise, but it is important to recognize their greatness and the substantial effort that they have invested in themselves.† ""Just trust and be confident in the hard work you put in because it will pay off ""î maybe not in ways you think, but it will,""ù Tiska said. Marin urged young girls to fight for the respect that women deserve in sports in order to foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie within the women athletic community. ""Be proud to be a woman in sports, and be proud to be in a community full of strong and dedicated athletes,""ù she said.

data,Navigating the bike-friendly campus: challenges and solutions at UCSB,16-Feb-24,10:00 AM,"['Ju Kim', 'Justin Zhou', 'Valeria Lopez']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-16/navigating-the-bike-friendly-campus-challenges-and-solutions-at-ucsb/,"As one steps on the UC Santa Barbara campus, one of the first things noticed are the bike paths and filled bike racks scattered throughout. During rush hour, it is not uncommon to see numerous bikes locked to random poles or even on patches of grass unlocked due to lack of spots on the bike racks. In particular, the bike racks next to the under-construction Music Building are especially egregious, with bikes scattered in bushes, locked to the chain-link fence or just tossed aside on the floor. Bike racks filled during rush hour (Nina Timofeyeva / Daily Nexus) As UCSB enrollment has increased over the past 10 years, the different modes of transportation have varied and adjusted to the way of student life. According to UCSB's commuter split data, in 2023, approximately 35% of students bike as their main form of transportation, which is a decrease from the 50% who biked in 2010. Additionally, there has been an increase in walking from 18% to 34% from 2010-23. Adam Jahnke ""î Associated Students Bike Shop supervisor of nine years ""î noted the safest option out of the commuter modes on campus, based on the number of accidents that occur from bikes. ""You have your own experience with seeing and/or hearing people get into wrecks on campus with bikes, boards, etc. So I would probably say on campus, walking is probably the safest, and walking without your headphones and being attentive.""ù† Jahnke added that there is a sense of fear among staff about the potential for riding vehicles to get stolen. ""There's always been a struggle with giving staff and faculty to also feel encouraged to ride on campus, so I think that little anecdote points to that perception that cycling and skateboarding, e-bikes, scooters are perceived as dangerous on campus,""ù he said.† It's important to note the local riders' perspective on commuters, as it can affect the attitude and behaviors of students toward each other.†† ""The first three weeks of any quarter are always really hectic. UCSB's overall age demographic skews on the younger side, and, again, this is anecdotal from my perspective, but I think the part of the danger that comes with the mobility on campus is that you might not have a terribly experienced ridership community.""ù† There has been a spike in telecommuting after the pandemic. According to the UCSB commuter split data, a steady 3-4% of staff worked from home from 2013-19, but in 2022, it spiked to 32%.†  Ôªø Michele Kunz ""î e-Commerce and Marketing Manager of the UCSB Campus Store ""î bikes to campus. She noted the various ways the campus could be improved to keep students and other faculty members safer when navigating campus.† ""Adding a dedicated bike lane on UCEN Road would create a safer environment for cyclists and help separate them from vehicular traffic. Paving the road would also improve overall accessibility,""ù she said in a statement to the Nexus. ""Painting crosswalks with bright colors can enhance visibility and raise awareness for drivers that there may be pedestrians or cyclists crossing. This can help improve safety for all road users.""ù Jahnke has a similar opinion on the ways UCSB's bike infrastructure could be improved to create a safer campus for students, staff and visitors. ""More paths ""î we could use better bike stripings. Signs on the paths, I think, would very much help students navigate, and to that point, if there were certain paths that would be aided with the addition of cones or barriers ""î especially if there's a space that's shared within a parking lot or adjacent to a road ""î I think all of those things would encourage ridership rates overall.""ù† Jahnke emphasized a list of behaviors that would improve the biking environment. ""I would say courtesy is at the top of that list, and in subcategories of courtesy, maybe no headphones on while you're riding a bike, maybe no phone usage ""î those are big ones,""ù he said. ""If you're turning, use your bell, use your voice to make people around you spatially aware of your intentions on where you're going.""ù†† Indeed, many students have personally experienced, or seen accidents occur on the bike paths. ""It's been not surprising to get responses from students who say they don't ride or skate or blade because they had had a really awful accident,""ù Jahnke said. Additionally, according to Jahnke, the large cycling community within Santa Barbara has transported its culture over to UCSB.† ""[Cycling culture has] coevolved with the university over the years, and it's an exceptional phenomenon we observe, where UCSB holds the highest ridership rate in America ""î given our population,""ù he said. Although meeting every individual's needs seems impossible, a small enhancement such as repaving some roads or painting stripings can prevent an accident and improve accessibility.   Matt Porter, a mathematics lecturer at UCSB, frequently alternates between biking and driving to navigate the campus. He likes biking since he believes it is generally safer compared to driving.† ""I think [the car] is the most dangerous method of transportation there is,""ù Porter said. Porter specifically criticized the infrastructure around the area near the Interactive Learning Pavilion at UCSB, noting significant concerns such as the integration of bike paths with vehicular traffic and the presence of potholes on UCEN Road. ""There are some [bike paths] ""¶ they put you on the road, and that stretch is pretty bad in terms of potholes,""ù Porter described. Porter also shed light on the relationship between bike paths and pedestrian areas at UCSB. He stressed the need for increased awareness among all campus commuters to enhance safety. Like Jahnke, Porter believes that a heightened consciousness about the shared use of these spaces can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure a safer campus environment. ""It seems like people walking are just never completely aware that there's bikes going by as well, so if we can improve awareness in some way, that will be good,""ù Porter said. Regarding parking costs at UCSB, Porter offered a contrasting viewpoint, drawing attention to his experience at Santa Barbara City College.† ""It's free for employees, which seems like it should be the case at any workplace, that you don't have to pay to be able to park at where you work,""ù he noted.† Additionally, the issue of bike security at UCSB can be a significant concern. As such, Porter brings his bike into his classrooms and offices, as a precaution against theft.  ""I know that even when it's locked, there is plenty of bike theft happening. I bring it into the classroom because I find with 10 [minutes] between classes, it's really the only way that I can get between my classrooms and be able to be ready to start on time instead of walking,""ù Porter said. ""My bike is way too expensive and special to me to trust leaving it outside.""ù

data,Food insecurity amongst UCSB students,23-Feb-24,5:55 AM,"['Karen Yuan', 'Olivia Davis', 'Jinglin Yang']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-23/food-insecurity-amongst-ucsb-students/,"At UC Santa Barbara, there are resources available for those experiencing food insecurity, or the lack of regular access to food, such as the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank at UCSB or the Food Security and Basic Needs Advising Center.† The data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the percent change of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers in the U.S. CPI measures the average change in price over time of consumer goods and services. (Olivia Davis / Daily Nexus) Food security is increasing among UC Santa Barbara students in light of the national increase in the cost of food over the last few years. The UC Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES) food insecurity data for 2018 indicated a majority of students who took the survey had very low food security: 49% of the students who took the survey experienced very low food security, 21% experienced low food security and 30% experienced high or marginal food security. (Karen Yuan / Daily Nexus) According to the UCUES food security data of 2022, 24% of the students who took the survey experienced very low food security, 19% experienced low food security and 57% experienced high or marginal food security. (Karen Yuan / Daily Nexus) Recently, statistics show there has been an increase in the percentage of students experiencing high or marginal food security. According to the UC Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES), 30% of students experienced high or marginal food security in 2018, which was before the COVID-19 pandemic and 57% experienced high or marginal food security in 2022. In other words, an additional 15,000 UC students were able to consistently access food.† The A.S. Food Bank at UCSB has dedicated their work toward improving food security among students on campus. The food bank offers order pick-ups at various locations around the campus and a program regarding the knowledge of food and nutrition to students. Throughout the 2021-22 school year, A.S. Food Bank distributed 179,651 pounds of food to students, according to data provided by A.S. Food Bank. Fifth-year anthropology major Michelle Woo, the A.S. Food Bank operations coordinator, said the A.S. Food Bank has developed a vending machine project, which is free of charge and collects meals from the Arbor. If the Arbor does not sell a food product by its expiration date, this program reclaims the food and provides it to those who are facing food insecurity. This vending machine is located in the lobby between the Multicultural Center and Associated Students and is available for students to access during operating hours of the building. ""We reclaim that food, and we'll put it in the vending machine. And then people who don't have kitchens or are just dealing with financial crises and can't cook or whatever can go to the vending machine, which is 100% free,""ù she said. The A.S. Food Bank has another initiative to help students facing food insecurity. The Department of Public Worms (DPW), an additional Associated Students entity, aims to compost food rather than waste it. According to Woo, the A.S. Food Bank's goal is to maximize the resources available to help students in need. ""We have been trying to put more snack stations in places and have better ways to meet students where they need to be,""ù Woo said. ""We just try to provide a well-rounded diet, making sure we have any kinds of [items for] other parts of the food group. Sometimes we'll adjust things for holidays.""ù According to A.S. Food Bank special programs supervisor Sarah Wagner, a fourth-year environmental studies major, one program that was introduced during the pandemic was the online bagging system to accommodate students with different kinds of needs, such as those who do not have a kitchen and those who only acquire produce. ""[The] program allowed students to submit online orders and pick up their food at any point during operating hours,""ù she said. While initially implemented due to COVID-19 restrictions, the A.S. Food Bank decided to continue the bagging system due to its convenience and efficiency, according to Wagner. ""[Students] appreciate browsing grocery options before visiting the food bank and having the flexibility to go when they please,""ù Wagner said.† The A.S. Food Bank additionally hosts pop-up events on campus where they provide free produce and snacks to students to serve as a mini-food bank and advocate for their program. ""[The pop-ups] take place at Pardall [Road] and the [Student Resource Building] SRB, meeting students where they are at ""¶ in a more central part of campus,""ù Wagner said.† Rebecca Segundo, the UCSB Basic Needs and Rapid Rehousing Program manager, added that the Food Security and Basic Needs Advising Center had become a distribution site for several other programs who were not able to deliver otherwise critical in-person services, such as the Undocumented Student Services Grocery Voucher Program, the Halal and Kosher Grocery Program and the Basic Needs Tech Support Program. ""More programs have developed in the last four years, as well as more program integration and coordination, which has allowed us to more intentionally serve students with meaningful impact,""ù Segundo said. Both Woo and Segundo emphasized the amount of programs and projects they launched to reach out to more UCSB students, making students aware of them and utilizing their resources. There has been a significant increase in the number of people experiencing high or marginal food security, according to the UCUES. ""This data aligns with the great work being done on the education front with our Health & Wellness team through the UCSB Cooks and Food, Nutrition & Basic Skills Program. These programs provide educational tools for students to learn how to prepare healthy and nutritious meals within their budget,""ù Segundo said. Source: A.S. Food BankThere was a significant decrease in the percentage of students registered for A.S. Food Bank services during the 2020-21 school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and campus closures, but otherwise, the percentage of students registering for A.S. Food Bank services increased each year. (Jinglin Yang / Daily Nexus) There was a significant decline in the percentage of students registered for A.S. Food Bank services in 2020-21 school year. Only 6.17% of enrolled students signed up for A.S. Food Bank services, but that number increased by approximately 16 percentage points in the 2021-22 school year as students returned to campus. During the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding campus closures, UCSB Basic Needs made changes to their programs and resources to accommodate students' needs.† ""Anecdotally, during [COVID-19] the needs of students changed significantly. While we had fewer UCSB students in the immediate campus area, the students in the area needed more support. We also conducted many programs remotely, including remote CalFresh registrations. In general, we had more food distributions and had fewer visits to the A.S. Food Bank,""ù Segundo said. To register for A.S. Food Bank services, students can sign up on the A.S. Food Bank website. The A.S. Food Bank also offers opportunities to volunteer and help combat food insecurity. The volunteer interest form can also be found on the official A.S. Food Bank website or students can visit foodbank.as.ucsb.edu/volunteer to sign up.
Print  Œî  Œî It's disheartening to see an increase in food insecurity among UCSB students. The efforts of organizations like the A.S. Food Bank and initiatives such as the vending machine project and composting by the Department of Public Worms are commendable. For students facing challenges, I'd also recommend checking out https://canadianwritings.com/ for academic support. Whether you're tackling Shakespeare or quantum physics, they've got experts who can handle it. It's like having a brainy friend in every class. It's a good thing that there are organizations like the A.S. Food Bank, the vending machine project and composting by the Department of Public Worms. It is not known what could have happened to the health of students if not for them. I hope that this will change for the better someday. In general, I suggest you relax and read an interesting blog https://educhill.com/, which will be very useful for both students and teachers.†

data,"Deltopia in full-throttle with record-level citations, massive crowds",10-Apr-24,10:31 AM,['Lizzy Rager'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-10/deltopia-in-full-throttle-with-record-level-citations-and-massive-crowds/,"     Document  

                                April 10, 2024 at 10:31 am by†Lizzy Rager   Approximately 20,000-25,000 people flooded the streets of Isla Vista on Saturday, April 6, for the 13th annual Deltopia ""î Isla Vista's unsanctioned street festival to mark the beginning of the spring quarter.    The streets were flooded on Deltopia as occupancy levels peaked at 20,000-25,000, the same levels as the Deltopia in 2014. Emma Wang / Daily Nexus  The Isla Vista festival tradition started as ""Floatopia,""ù a large beach event from roughly 2008 to 2009. Deltopia emerged in 2010 as a response to the county shutting down Isla Vista beaches. The 2014 Deltopia experienced riots with dozens of injuries, 130 arrests, and over 192 citations. In 2020 and 2021, there was no Deltopia festival due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   This year, alongside attendance rising by approximately 10,000 from 2023, citations, arrests and medical emergency calls grew in tandem, according to Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP) Lieutenant Garrett TeSlaa. This Deltopia marks the most citations issued in the history of the festival, about 35% more than the 190 citations issued in the 2014 Deltopia.   Officers from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office (SBSO), UC Police Department, Santa Maria Police Department and the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) policed the streets in droves, a presence that some community members felt was ""overreaching.""ù   ""They would walk in formation like they were soldiers up and down our street. It was a little scary, honestly,""ù third-year environmental studies major Alex Tatuaca said.   County festival rules changed how party hosts prepared for the festival and the jurisdiction of law enforcement to shut down parties. The newest Santa Barbara County social host ordinance mandated only 250 people may attend a party and that paid parties are illegal. The outdoor festival ordinance ""î† wherein from Friday, April 6 to Sunday, April 9, loud music is restricted between 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. ""î† was also in full effect after 13 parties were shut down on Saturday.   Though he doesn't have a comprehensive plan, TeSlaa said SBSO is ""certainly not going to have a smaller police presence""ù for Deltopia 2025 given this year's outcome.    Del Playa was the most densly populated street during Deltopia weekend. Photo courtesy Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office  Arrests and citations steeply increase since 2023   Over Deltopia weekend, SBSO and partner agencies issued 256 citations and made 32 arrests ""î all misdemeanors ""î according to SBSO. This Deltopia marks the most citations issued in the history of the festival, about 35% more than the 190 citations issued in the 2014 Deltopia. Most arrests consisted of disorderly conduct, 19 of the total.   
  Citations increased nearly 40% from 2023, when 151 citations were issued. ABC agents issued 52 citations, and SBSO issued 192. Sheriff deputies primarily issued citations for open-container and minor in possession of alcohol charges.   ""Citations were up because there were more cops but people were out drinking in a manner that was far more aggressive than then last year,""ù TeSlaa said.    California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control officers issued 52 of the 256 total citations.† Wesley Haver / Daily Nexus  No misdemeanor citations are eligible this year for the IVFP's Restorative Justice (RJ) Program, which was suspended from 6 a.m. on Saturday, April 6 to 6 a.m. on Sunday, April 7. Last year, 13 of the 151 issued citations were eligible.   The program was established in 2019 as a community-level approach where UCSB students and I.V. residents could waive nonviolent misdemeanor citations by taking a class and completing community service hours. The Associated Students External Vice President for Local Affairs office issued an unsuccessful petition a week before Deltopia to reverse the suspension of the RJ Program.   The crowds were largest on Saturday and concentrated at oceanside Del Playa Drive residences. SBSO Public Information Officer Raquel Zick said residents mostly complied with the social host ordinance and the outdoor festival ordinance, but officers issued 13 citations for ""illegal parties,""ù resulting in their subsequent shutdown. One party was shut down for charging for entry.   ""Parties were smaller. They were closer to 250 or under. We didn't see the thousands of people at a party like we saw last year,""ù TeSlaa said.   Several party hosts used the app POSH for attendees to reserve their spots ahead of the festival. Some party houses, like the Biko Garage, utilized a wristband system to track entry.†  Despite efforts like the suspension of the RJ Program and the new social ordinance rules aimed to lower occupancy levels, out-of-towners from nearby universities, cities and out-of-country flocked to the festival.    13 parties were shutdown over the weekend for noncompliance with social host ordinance rules. Wesley Haver / Daily Nexus  Local emergency services at capacity by Saturday morning   Emergency services were overwhelmed and ran out of ambulances by 9 a.m. on Saturday, according to Santa Barbara County Fire Department Public Information Officer Scott Safechuck. Emergency response medical calls totaled 106 and emergency services made 35 transports to local hospitals. Most of the calls were for acute alcohol intoxication.   In 2023, emergency services responded to 60 medical calls, 33 requiring hospitalization.   
  At a medical tent on Trigo Road, EMTs assessed 56 patients, of which 41 were released without transport to a local hospital. TeSlaa noted the tent was primarily filled with college-aged women suffering from a combination of overdose or alcohol overdose. When ambulances were no longer available, sheriff deputies used pickup trucks and police cars to transport individuals to the tent or a local hospital.   ""It got so bad people were collapsing in the streets,""ù TeSlaa said. ""If we had not had that [tent] we would have been closer to doubling, if not tripling, the transports to the hospitals this year.""ù    UC Police Department officers survey the streets as a festival-goer is being carried away on a stretcher to get medical services. Wesley Haver / Daily Nexus  The sheriff's deputies are following up on two separate reports of sexual assault. These investigations are ongoing.   ""We often don't highlight the fact that there's very real, long-term, lifelong consequences to an event like this in many ways for many people and the impacts that that's gonna have,""ù TeSlaa said.   One unidentified adult male attempted to harm himself by running off a bluff edge but was thwarted by sheriff deputies.   ""My deputies who were there risked their own lives to prevent this person from taking theirs,""ù TeSlaa said. ""And it's one of the most admirable things I've ever seen in 20 years of policing that I've been involved in.""ù   To draw festival-goers away from Del Playa Drive and increase overall safety, the Isla Vista Community Services District hosted an alternative event ""î the Spring Festival ""î at Little Acorn Park. A University of California in Isla Vista tent stationed at the park distributed water, snacks, Narcan, fentanyl test strips and sanitary wipes to over 2,800 individuals, according to an Instagram post. Allegedly one dose of Narcan was administered, according to TeSlaa.    Isla Vista Community Services District drew in crowds away from Del Playa with its Spring Festival. Wesley Haver / Daily Nexus  All streets south of Trigo Road were closed to vehicle traffic. California Highway Patrol stopped and screened 310 of 850 passing cars at a Storke Road checkpoint coming out of Isla Vista, beginning at 6 p.m. Three citations were issued for unlicensed drivers and one for driving without a license.   One stopped car backed up and rear-ended another car at the checkpoint. The driver was arrested for driving under the influence.   ""The word of mouth is being spread by students to their friends,""ù TeSlaa said. ""That this is the place to be.""ù    A constant flow of people walked toward other parties or left town. Emma Wang / Daily Nexus  This article was corrected on April 10, 2024, to reflect that the 2024 Deltopia is the 13th rendition of the street festival, the first Deltopia was in-fact in 2010 rather than 2014, explained the 2014 Deltopia riots and clarified its distinction from Deltopia predecessor, Floatopia.

data,The realities of the job market post-graduation: Insights from UCSB alumni,3-May-24,9:00 AM,"['Alexandra Chan', 'Kacey Ly', 'Donghyun Cha', 'Benjamin Monastyrsky']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-03/the-realities-of-the-job-market-post-graduation-insights-from-ucsb-alumni/,"As the 2023-24 school year comes to a close, students of the graduating class take a new step toward their future, whether it be the pursuit of higher education or the beginning of their professional career. The trajectory of one's career seems straightforward: graduate from college with a degree in a particular major and then pursue jobs within that chosen field.† In reality, about 80% of college students end up switching their major at least once. Furthermore, of the 53% of employed U.S. adults who quit their job in 2021, 61% of 18 to 29-year-olds shifted their field of work. The flexibility of career exploration throughout college and the workforce is common, yet also intimidating to many students taking the first steps in their journeys.† Maya Jagota, a peer advisor for Career Services and a third-year statistics and data science major, described many of the situations students consult with her.† ""People come in and know exactly what they want to do. They're like, how do I get from point A to point B. And then some people are like, I don't even know, there's nothing I enjoy doing, nothing sparks me, I just don't even know what to do,""ù Jagota said. In her personal life, she grew up in a ""tech-heavy""ù family and has always known that she would go into tech. Her issue, as many other students face, was finding her niche in the field she decided. ""Major doesn't equal career. You don't necessarily need to be doing the most specific major or you don't need to have it figured out right now. You can always change it,""ù Jagota said. She explained the various resources that Career Services at UCSB provides, including a ""What Can I Do With This Major?""ù guide, helping students explore all possible career options stemming from a major. Joining clubs ""î exploring new options ""î she emphasized, is a good way to find new opportunities unimagined before.† However, the current job market appears bleak for many graduating students. While the unemployment rate of the U.S. is at the record low of 3.4% according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the unemployment rate for ages 20-24 sits at 7.1%, more than double that. For comparison, during the September-October market crash of 2008, the unemployment rate for ages 20-24 according to the Federal Reserve Economic Data sat at 10.8%, which is about triple the number of the total unemployment rate today.† As the job market dynamics continue to change, recent graduates from UCSB face both challenges and opportunities in navigating their career trajectories.†  Russell Chia, a recent environmental studies graduate, shared his journey of discovering his major. He initially entered UCSB as an economics major but found his passion in environmental studies by exploring various classes and professors.† ""Getting experience in econ was good because it kind of opened up my eyes and made me realize I'm not really into that major ""¶ It's definitely a learning experience, and especially with loads of classes, you learn what you don't like, and you can, from there, decide what career path you want to take,""ù Chia said. As an international student, Chia faces unique challenges in the post-grad job market. The reality of securing a full-time position is compounded by the need for employers willing to sponsor work visas. This additional layer can dramatically narrow the field of opportunities for non-citizen graduates. While the job market may seem daunting, Chia advised current students to focus on building connections and gaining practical experience early on.† ""It's not that simple and linear. You kind of realize that, especially as an entry level, you have to take what you get and be realistic in what you can get and where your experience lies compared to so many other people. Especially during these days, everyone has a bachelor's and everyone has a college degree, so you have to realize that you've got to climb the ladder rather than just going into your dream job.""ù This complexity often requires international graduates like Chia to consider alternative pathways such as additional internships, further education or temporary positions that may lead to more stable opportunities.† Reflecting on his UCSB experience, Chia stressed the importance of gaining practical experience through internships and part-time positions. He emphasized the value of alumni connections and suggested that current students take advantage of alumni events to expand their network.† He also expressed that his internships were instrumental in providing real-world exposure, allowing him to apply his academic knowledge in practical settings. For alumni connections, he emphasizes that ""attending alumni events and engaging with UCSB alumni really opened [his] eyes to the job market. These connections can lead to job recommendations and referrals, which is crucial in this competitive job market.""ù Jagota echoed this sentiment, stating, ""Staying connected with people on LinkedIn [is important], and then also just in clubs, organizations and really talking to the people around you, just because they have a lot of insight to offer your profession. Your peers are all doing a bunch of stuff and just with one conversation, you can kind of open yourself up to so many different opportunities.""ù In addition, Chia advised that a graduate doesn't have to immediately search for a job; they can also search for internships and do part time jobs in the meanwhile. ""So you have to start small,""ù Chia said. ""You can still get an internship, you can still get a part time position, and whilst you're doing that, you can find a job, but don't waste your time.""ù Both Chia and Jagota emphasized finding what one really wants to pursue and not placing such importance on major selection. Economics has been the most popular field of study among UCSB alumni on LinkedIn, according to aggregated data from 1980 to 2023, with outcomes of approximately 189,000 UCSB alumni by graduation year found on the UC Santa Barbara LinkedIn page. However, for 2023 alumni, the most popular fields of work ""î apart from further education ""î were research and operations.† Furthermore, the popularity of many fields of work tends to fluctuate. In general, most UCSB alumni on LinkedIn that graduated in the early to mid-2000s pursued a job in business, whereas engineering is the most popular field of work for alumni who graduated in the mid-2010s.   Along with the advice provided by Chia and Jagota, May Nguyen, a recent 2023 financial mathematics and statistics graduate, shared her success from networking and gaining valuable internship experience. Shortly after graduation, she started working at Chevron under the Finance Development Program. Nguyen attributed this success to her unconventional connections to Chevron through babysitting for families of the company. ""I feel now in the industry, it's all about who you know, really. I got a couple interviews through other companies just by cold applying, but it's hard for them to stick because they don't have any credibility for who you are and what experience you can do,""ù Nguyen stated.†   Nguyen also emphasized that, despite being early on in her career, she has other plans to explore the field of data science rather than sticking to finance analytics. She discovered this aspiration through both her courses at UCSB and side projects.† ""Right now I'm just trying to find pockets of time where I can implement data projects. And it can be as simple as improving an Excel sheet or creating a dashboard. But I do want to switch to data in the future,""ù Nguyen said. ""I thought I wanted to do finance, so that's why I went into this position, but now that I'm here, I've actually realized that the field that I actually enjoy more is data analytics. So I think in the future, my goal is to switch into data, not really like finance.""ù Much like Nguyen's career exploration, Jagota stressed the importance of evaluating and experimenting with fields of study and interest. She said that especially during the years of undergraduate school, exploration is key for discovering personal interest, because it unlocks opportunities for potential networking and skill development. ""It's super common to kind of change your mind. We always tell people, ""òDo not feel the need to just stick to one thing that you don't actually enjoy doing. You never know where your career journey is gonna go,'""ù Jagota said. ""So just being open-minded to anything that can come up and just like trying to learn from every experience you have, even if it doesn't seem like what you were supposed to go through.""ù††

data,UCSB academic departments have seen growth in undergraduate degrees conferred in recent years,16-May-24,4:54 PM,"['Annaka Lee', 'Nixon Tse']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-16/ucsb-academic-departments-have-seen-growth-in-undergraduate-degrees-conferred-in-recent-years/,"At UC Santa Barbara, communication, psychological & brain sciences, economics, biological sciences, statistics and data science and physics are among the top growing majors from the 2013-14 school year to the 2022-23 school year. In recent years, the UCSB has witnessed an increase in the number of overall students enrolled into the school. While this trend has been growing steadily, the number of undergraduate degrees awarded increased dramatically between the years 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 near the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic. There was a slight decline in subsequent years following the pandemic, but the number of undergraduate degrees awarded increased again during the 2022-23 academic year.  The College of Letters & Science has particularly seen a significant increase in degrees conferred within several majors. Some of the most consistently growing majors are communication, psychological & brain sciences and statistics and data science.†  Psychological & Brain Sciences, a newer major established in 2016 to replace the B.A. in Psychology, experienced a recent surge in enrollment at UCSB. The interdisciplinary nature of psychology, along with its relevance to various career paths, makes the major an appealing choice for students interested in fields such as clinical or counseling psychology, education, law enforcement or sales and marketing, according to the UCSB Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have played a significant role in shaping academic interests, impacting majors more relevant to the global crisis. Out of the majors that have experienced the most growth, psychological & brain sciences saw the greatest increase in degrees received during the years of the global pandemic, as students likely became interested in addressing the rising public health issues and challenges.† According to the UCSB Office of Budget & Planning, another major that has experienced especially significant growth is the statistics and data science major. As a newer major, the number of degrees conferred has increased almost 300% from its earliest recorded data in the 2019-20 school year to the 2022-23 school year.† The Division of Undergraduate Education did not respond to requests for comment regarding the growth of the communication, statistics and data science and psychological & brain sciences majors. Third-year College of Creative Studies mathematics major Daniel Naylor, the director of technical development of the organization Data Science UCSB, said that just like its computer science counterpart, data science will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. ""I would say the growth of data science now is very akin to the growth of computer science within the last 20 years. Software became very prominent in the public eye and companies started to demand it, so naturally, more people went to study it. Now we're seeing a similar effect except with data,""ù Naylor said. According to Naylor, data science is becoming more and more popular because of its high demand in the job market.† ""I do believe the reason why there's a lot of people majoring in it is because data science is in high demand,""ù Naylor said.† He added that with the continued advancement in technology and artificial intelligence, data science will continue to be a popular major at UCSB. Dealing with the organization and analysis of data, the major could be applied to a broad range of jobs. ""I think most statistics and data science majors here would go into an analytics career. I do have some friends that are going into data engineering and [machine learning] engineering, though,""ù Naylor said. Another growing major in recent years is communication. While the major has seen an increase in degrees conferred since 2014, it has seen a huge surge since 2020.† The UCSB Department of Communication advising team said that what might contribute to the popularity of the communication major is that UCSB offers many opportunities for students within the major. ""Our department offers exclusive research assistant opportunities, and internship credit to support students in their academic and career growth. Students have the privilege to network with Communication Alumni through our UCSB Comm Mentoring Program,""ù the Department of Communication said in a statement to the Nexus. Notably, the Department of Communication advisors expect more enrollees in the major in the future, particularly among the transfer students.† ""We have been working to improve our Transfer Student Orientation materials to best prepare students for the next steps they should take as they transition into UCSB and make their way into the full major,""ù the Department of Communication advisors said. UCSB's economics major has also seen quite continuous growth over recent years in contrast to the economics and accounting major. The economics major experienced an increase in growth from 2016-2020 and most recently from 2022-2023. By contrast, economics and accounting has seen a decline in degrees conferred since the 2019-20 school year.†† Ôªø Fourth-year economics major Reed Callister, co-president of The Finance Connection ""î a financial club at UCSB ""î said that a contributing factor to the growth in economics degrees conferred, rather than degrees in economics and accounting, could be the broadness of the economics major.† ""It is not specialized in nature, so it allows you to be flexible in terms of career approach and coursework to be taken. Perhaps this reality has been increasingly appealing for students and led to more people choosing to study economics over the past decade,""ù Callister said. According to Callister, a degree in economics opens up a wide array of career opportunities for students, spanning across several sectors such as business, sales, accounting, finance and law as many undergraduates may find themselves pursuing careers in financial analysis, market research, management consulting or even public policy. However, Callister is doubtful that the economics major's current growth rate in degrees conferred will continue due to a lack of space in economics classes.† ""Speaking from personal experience and on behalf of peers in the major, upper-division economics courses are often hard to come by, and many students are frustrated by the lack of courses available during certain quarters,""ù Callister said. ""There are clearly lots of people interested and if there are too many, the department will have to either limit the number of people able to get into the major or add faculty and resources so the demand can be met.""ù To combat this issue, the economics department has introduced new upper-division economics courses, including Entrepreneurial Insights and Health Economics. According to Reed, such new courses expand the range of economic topics covered and also provide additional opportunities for students to enroll in economics classes, helping to alleviate the pressure on existing courses.† However, if UCSB cannot continue to match the demand for more classes and accommodate for the increase in students, the rate of growth in economics and other fast-growing majors may decrease in the future.†

data,Disruption and dialogue: Quantifying the effects of the UC school system strikes,23-May-24,4:26 PM,"['Winston Zuo', 'Kyle Wu', 'Calais Waring', 'Megan Dhillon']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-23/disruption-and-dialogue-quantifying-the-effects-of-the-uc-school-system-strikes/,"Michelle Wu / Daily Nexus In the nearly six-week strike that began in November 2022 and would ultimately be the largest higher education strike in U.S. history, United Auto Workers Local 2865 ""î the union that at the time represented 48,000 University of California graduate student workers including teaching assistants and researchers ""î formed picket lines with hopes of addressing wage disparities and enhancing working conditions. Within the first week, the strike instantly altered the climate of campus, leaving an immediate impact on students, faculty and administrators, according to fourth-year biology major and student worker in De La Guerra Dining Commons, Uma Clemenceau. ""I was really taken aback at how much disruption withholding labor could cause at the school, and I thought that, wow, that's really powerful,""ù Clemenceau said. ""A collective action of that magnitude is like a political consciousness raising event for a lot of students ""¶ I don't think the campus had ever seen anything like that before.""ù After five and a half weeks of work interruption, United Auto Workers (UAW) and University of California (UC) negotiators came to an agreement on Dec. 23, 2022, which included pay increases, anti-bullying measures and eight weeks of medical and parental leave for academic workers throughout the UC system.† Now, more than a year removed from the strike, the UCSB community shared their sentiments regarding the new contract, evaluating changes in wage adjustments and overall effects on educational quality.† Sentiment from teaching assistants post-strike indicate that the wage increases provided to academic workers were relatively noticeable. In a statement to the Nexus, Michael Keith, a teaching assistant in the mathematics department affirmed the sentiment.† ""I find the largest impact to be the revisions to the contract, which were largely beneficial to graduate students. In particular, the wage increases were quite helpful for many in my department,""ù Keith said.† As a result of the strike, the minimum base pay among teaching assistants was to rise from $24,000 to $36,000 by the end of 2024 and also included a $2,000 per semester childcare subsidy. Salaries for academic workers also rose as a result of the strike settlement.† The contract also brought changes to the payment structure for teaching assistants. Teaching assistants are now appointed at different places on a salary scale where experience is the primary determining factor of what place is assigned, according to Leila Rupp, interim graduate dean at UCSB. This structure would increase a teaching assistant's salary if they had worked for at least six quarters at their given campus.†  ""A teaching assistant with at least six quarters of experience at 25% [employment] or higher at the same campus shall be placed at salary point 2 or higher, including when this threshold is met during a multi-quarter appointment,""ù Rupp said. Madeline Vailhe, a third-year materials graduate student researcher, said that they felt additional security due to the increase in wages, specifically surrounding her housing and living conditions.† ""[The raise] has at least alleviated my concerns in terms of just knowing that I had to move off campus. I felt a lot better in terms of housing security,""ù Vailhe said.† However, some teaching assistants expressed continued dissatisfaction with the way salaries were determined for student workers, highlighting the precarity still facing many student workers. Keith underscored the tension present at the time among academic workers.† ""I think a majority of students in my department welcomed the changes, but there were a vocal few who felt dissatisfied because they thought the changes weren't enough. Also, a few of us chose not to strike but still supported our friends. This initially caused some tension in our cohort even though we agreed to respect each other's decisions prior to the strike,""ù Keith said. ""However, the winter break following the strike seemed to give people the time to reflect and relax, so the tensions have largely dissipated.""ù† Michelle Wu / Daily Nexus In particular, the current high rate of inflation has caused some distress among some academic workers, regarding the viability of their wages moving forward.† Cedar Brown, a doctoral candidate in the linguistics department, shared their concerns regarding the pay structure in a statement to the Nexus, emphasizing its potential failure to address inflation and rising housing costs. ""The wage increase was not tied to the cost of living, leaving grad workers vulnerable to inflation and rising housing costs. However, for many workers, I know [the wage increase] has relieved some of the embodied stress and anxiety around money,""ù Brown said. Following the strikes, there have been worries about the potential negative long-term effects either on the university's end or for undergraduate and graduate students. Specifically, there is a fear that the increased salaries could lead to the university cutting back on graduate students' admissions and decrease the number of sections, or increase the ratio of undergraduate students to teaching assistants. Despite these apprehensions, as of Winter Quarter 2024, the school has yet to see any significant decline in teaching assistant and class size metrics. In the 15 main quarters† ""î fall, winter and spring ""î leading up to the strike, there was a median of 1934.5 classes ""î sections, seminars, labs and studios ""î that were led by a graduate student. In the four quarters post-strike, the median remained essentially unchanged at 1934 and generally remained between 1800-2100 classes.†  Moreover, examining another key indicator of teaching quality ""ì the ratio of undergraduate students to teaching assistants ""ì reveals that over the past eleven quarters, including six pre-strike and four post-strike quarters, the ratio has remained at approximately 21 undergraduates per teaching assistant. This is in contrast to the consistently higher ratio of about 22 to 23 undergraduates per teaching assistant that was common from winter 2018 to spring 2020, and has not been approached since.  Clemenceau said that she has observed that academic workers have been better off since the new contract. ""I wouldn't say the teaching style or interactions I have with them through my studies are very different, but on a personal level, I think academic workers in general who I've met have been better off.""ù Keith added that provisions were put in place to ensure workers were not mistreated as a result of participating in the strike. ""[T]here are contract changes to ensure students aren't retaliated against due to the strike or changes.""ù Despite the fractiousness of the initial conflict, the communications strategist for the UC Office of the President, Heather Hansen, stated that the University of California believed that the contract reached with the UAW provides UC employees with fair wages.†† ""The University of California is committed to recognizing all employees, union-represented and non-union-represented, with valuable compensation and benefit packages. The settlement reached with the UAW unit reflects those values and commitment,""ù Hansen said. Hansen added that the University appreciates its employees and that the University hopes that future contract negotiations occur through existing bargaining processes rather than through strikes. ""The University is grateful to our UAW-represented employees for their dedication and hard work in support of our campuses, our students and faculty, our medical centers, and toward our larger missions of education, research and public service,""ù Hansen said. ""We are committed to negotiating agreement terms through the existing bargaining process, which involves thoughtful proposals and meaningful discussions to reach a resolution. Work stoppages disrupt this process.""ù Hansen stated that the UC viewed the increase in employee compensation as a positive investment in its workers. ""Regarding financial decisions, employee compensation is an investment in our people, driving retention and recognition. We make financially responsible compensation decisions that support our commitment to our valued workforce,""ù Hansen said.   While the ramifications of the new contract remain preliminary, initial data suggests a favorable outcome for the academic workers involved, as graduate student workers not only gained increased financial security but have also been able to simultaneously maintain the number of teaching opportunities. However, the true measure of the strike's effectiveness will unfold over time while the university welcomes new cohorts of graduate students to replace the current group. ""Me and my coworkers were already organizing last year before the strike started in the dining hall, but seeing what they won and seeing the kind of industry standard-setting contracts that the academic workers here won definitely inspired us to want to affiliate with UAW and join that union,""ù Clemenceau said. Michelle Wu / Daily Nexus Despite the increase in wages in the new contracts for academic workers, Brown noted the lack of change for some marginalized workers. ""Unfortunately, the issues of many of the most marginalized workers were not prioritized in this current contract. It is important that protections for disabled workers and international student workers are centered,""ù Brown said. Though there are still issues to work on for future contracts, Clemenceau appreciated and emphasized the power of the UAW's efforts to secure better working conditions. ""A side effect of the strike is that a lot of new organizing came out of it. And I think that's really inspirational,""ù Clemenceau said. Due to recent developments surfacing around the mistreatment of pro-Palestinian protesters at multiple UC campuses, the union currently representing academic workers ""î UAW 4811, formed as a merging of UAW 2865 (which represented student workers) and UAW 5810 (which represented academic employees and postdoctoral researchers) ""î has once again voted to authorize a strike, thus highlighting ongoing and unresolved tensions between graduate student workers and the UC as a whole.

data,From campus to capital: Insights into UCSB's Investment Advisory Committee,2-Jun-24,8:00 AM,"['Kyle Wu', 'Siddharth Chattoraj', 'Lance Sanchez', 'Bowie Chuang', 'Winston Zuo']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-06-02/from-campus-to-capital-insights-into-ucsbs-investment-advisory-committee/,"The Associated Students Investment Advisory Committee (IAC) is an undergraduate-run investment committee funded by Associated Students dedicated to educating their fellow UCSB classmates in finance and investing through hands-on investment analysis, discussion and action.† Working with their active portfolio, students at any level of investment experience have the opportunity to become more knowledgeable in the investing and finance industry. The Investment Advisory Committee (IAC) manages an active portfolio worth over $200,000. The best-performing stock the IAC holds is NVIDIA ""î a technology company that is well-known for inventing graphics processing units† ""î with an unrealized return percentage of 37,744.43% and a realized gain percentage of 1,399.84%. The unrealized return percentage is the potential gain or loss on an investment based on current market value if sold immediately, while realized gains reflect the actual profits made based on already executed sales.   Reed Callister, a fourth-year economics major and the co-chairman of the IAC, said in an email statement to the Nexus that he initially joined IAC to gain practical investment experience and learn about diverse industry fields. ""I decided to join IAC to get hands-on investment experience, learn about interesting business models and industries, and surround myself with smart and like-minded peers,""ù Callister said. According to Callister, joining IAC is generally an intensive process that involves a formal application process and multiple rounds of interviews. ""IAC holds two recruitment cycles each school year ""î one in the fall and one in the spring. Prospective members must fill out an online application form and then undergo two rounds of interviews carried out by executive board members,""ù Callister said. The IAC is divided into nine groups:† Energy and Utilities; Industrials and Commodities; Real Estate; Fixed Income; Healthcare and Life Sciences; Special Situations; Consumer Defensive/Cyclical; Financial Institutions and Technology; Media, & Telecommunications, according to Callister. Each group is led by a portfolio manager and consists of junior analysts and occasionally one senior analyst, and there are approximately 80 members in IAC.† As their names suggest, each IAC group is responsible for understanding and finding investments in different sectors of the market, with various groups finding different degrees of success. Of note is the Technology, Media, & Telecommunications group, which currently has unrealized returns of more than 320%.  Members in each sector pitch and present proposals for managing the fund once quarterly, including the buying and selling of securities, which include financial assets such as stocks, bonds and exchange traded funds. The executive board members then vote to decide whether or not the proposals are approved.† ""Securities are sold when the committee determines they are no longer appropriate investments, which can include low-performing stocks as well as high-performing stocks that are priced highly in the market. The cash received in exchange for the sold securities are retained by the fund and reallocated to more attractive investments,""ù Callister said. Callister said that most of the assets under management by the IAC come from reinvested earnings from previous investments, but IAC has also directly received injections of cash from Associated Students (A.S.).† ""The last time IAC received funding from A.S. was in 2018, for $20k, and before that in 2012, for $8k,""ù Callister said. In using these funds, Callister mentioned that IAC has adapted their investment strategy to fit the current economic landscape. ""Our investment strategy has always revolved around finding attractive, undervalued businesses that we feel offer compelling cash flow prospects,""ù Callister noted. ""Over the years, however, as certain macroeconomic and industry-specific dynamics have evolved, we have altered our approach and focus to account for all relevant investment considerations.""ù The adaptability of IAC has resulted in consistent growth of their holdings, with positive annual growth observed except for a decline between 2021 and 2022. Between Dec. 31, 2010 and May 24, 2024, IAC's account value increased from $32,940.24 to $245,768.04.†  Matthew Tekle, a fourth-year biology major who is not part of IAC, said that he sees the IAC's occasional use of student fees for investments as a justified allocation. ""Honestly, I think this is a valid use of our fees. In comparison to the other resources and departments that our fees go to, I think this is one that I find is being utilized well. And honestly, it's interesting to see,""ù Tekle said.† In analyzing the actual performances of IAC's investments, Callister shed light onto the best and worst-performing holdings. ""Out of our current holdings, NVIDIA is our best performer (up 32,772% since investing) and Opendoor is our worst performer (down 92% since investing).""ù IAC tends to retain its top-performing investments. However, they also occasionally elect to sell their holdings, in part or in full, and as a result have seen strong returns on some of their investments, including NVIDIA (1,399.84% realized gain) and Apple (363.83% realized gain). ""We generally decide to hold high-performing investments assuming they are appropriately priced in the market,""ù Callister stated. ""We often decide to sell partial stakes throughout our holding periods and have done so with NVIDIA (10 shares were sold in spring of 2023).""ù  Some of IAC's investments may also imply ethical considerations. IAC currently holds 33 shares of Blackstone, an investment management company that has faced controversy for its role in the California housing crisis. In a statement to the Nexus, Callister addressed these possible ethical concerns.† ""All of [IAC's] investments undergo an approval process by the A.S. Senate, and IAC will adhere to whatever investment guidelines are proposed,""ù Callister said. ""Our investment proposals include [environmental, social and governance] analysis ""î but drawing the line is not always a straightforward process, and a consistent standard should be used in doing so.""ù Tekle commended IAC's stock selections, highlighting their stability and many of the companies' positive impact on the public. ""Looking at Pfizer, CVS [and] Medtronic, they seem to be choosing, I would say, non-controversial, in a way, safe choices,""ù Tekle said. ""These are all companies that are making a decent amount of contributions to the general public. I think Pfizer obviously being the most pertinent one with COVID and whatnot.""ù Tekle was also impressed by the high return percentage of many of IAC's stock choices. ""I am seeing a lot of good choices looking at the return percentage. I see NVIDIA, which they've gotten a ton back. So, for my basic understanding, I would say that the choices they've made have been well constructed,""ù Tekle said.  Callister said that IAC selects its investments by thoroughly analyzing potential businesses to find those that are undervalued, consistently profitable and well-positioned in promising industries. ""The Investment Advisory Committee performs fundamental analysis on each of its prospective investments, with the goal of finding undervalued businesses that deliver consistent and sustainable cash flows and likewise hold strong market positions in attractive industries,""ù Callister said. Tekle said that he would prefer to see the IAC focus their investments more on specific sectors, such as healthcare or real estate. ""Ideally, we could maybe increase the amount of funding in healthcare in comparison to other companies or maybe even real estate ""¶ I feel like there could be a better focus on certain industries,""ù Tekle said.

A deep dive into A.S. budget allocation and student services,2-Jun-24,8:00 AM,"['Bowie Chuang', 'Anna Li', 'Valeria Lopez']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-06-02/wheres-our-tuition-going-a-deep-dive-into-a-s-budget-allocation-and-student-services/,"Beyond tuition at UCSB, a portion of each student's fees also goes towards Associated Students each quarter. Of the $5239.13 in fees paid every quarter by undergraduates, $237.29 goes to Associated Students (A.S.), a student-run organization funded by these fees. Established in 1961, A.S.'s mission is to provide leadership, employment, cultural and growth opportunities to serve the campus community. The three branches ""î Executive, Legislative and Judicial ""î within A.S. manage a yearly budget allocated to a wide-range of student-run organizations, programs and services.† This A.S. fee is distributed among various entities. It directly funds A.S. departments such as the A.S. Bike Shop and the A.S. Food Bank. It also supports independent-run student organizations such as the Daily Nexus and campus-wide programs including CLAS and Arts & Lectures.† The quarterly A.S. student fee for a single person has increased over the past ten years, from around 180 to now over 230.(Bowie Chuang / Daily Nexus) According to the A.S. budget, the main factors in budget allocation are staff salaries, supplies and rentals/leases. These funds are essential for enabling campus organizations ""î especially new clubs ""î to provide services and assistance for UCSB students.† Newly founded in 2022, Data Science Collaborative aims to make data science accessible to everyone on campus by offering one-on-one mentorships, foundational workshops and career check-ins.† Anabelle Gutman ""î treasurer of UCSB Data Science Collaborative ""î highlighted the importance of securing funding from A.S. for their club in an email statement to the Nexus. ""We initially secured funding for our club by applying for the $250 Start Up Fund via the UCSB Associated Students Finance and Business Committee. We used careful analysis of student-traffic patterns to conduct our fundraisers, selling products such as branded stickers or homemade egg tarts during peak hours for maximum profitability,""ù Gutman said.† Gutman describes what the budgeting process for the Data Science Collaborative looks like.† ""When budgeting we first focus on assessing the needs of the club by seeing which events require funding and which can be done using supplies we already have. We then look into how much money we have available and estimate the costs associated with each activity,""ù Gutman said. ""In addition, we effectively support the next generation of staff by allocating enough funds for next year's start-off expenditures, such as tabling to advocate for our organization and fundraising.""ù The Data Science Collaborative keeps track of the funds for long term planning to maximize profit. This is done through a spreadsheet that keeps track of supplies, money spent and estimates of future expenditures, which allows room for any emergencies. Although the process may seem straightforward, Data Science Collaborative has experienced many challenges along the way.† ""We've struggled to obtain funding for our club because although we've reached out to numerous companies and organizations in hopes of building partnerships, we haven't yet secured any. However, we efficiently overcome these barriers by constantly working together to think of new fundraiser events. Having group participation in the facilitation, execution and promotion of our events, spearheaded by our outreach team, ensures effective fundraising measures that maximize our impact on the community and financially,""ù Gutman said. Despite some obstacles in receiving funding for the Data Science Collaborative through partnerships, the officers work together to create events for the community at UCSB as a way to fund the club.† ""We also love analyzing trends such as certain bakeries or restaurants that are currently popular. We communicate with our staff about whether they are interested in them and think they'll be well received by the club members,""ù Gutman said. While various campus clubs and organizations such as Data Science Collaborate draw resources from these funds, the allocation and decision-making regarding funding requests for each club are still controlled by the AS Financial & Business Committee (F&B).† Valerie Tran, a third-year economics and accounting major and a financial officer at F&B, provided insights into the process of making such decisions, which occurs during the committee's weekly meetings on Mondays. Budget meetings involve evaluating funding requests submitted by campus organizations.† ""They'll come to our Monday meetings and just present their request, and our criteria for giving them funds is: 1) they're a registered campus organization (RCO) for more than one academic quarter and 2) they don't have any stipulations or guidelines for any forms of membership like it's based on gender and a monetary stipulation to be in this organization,""ù Tran said.† Tran added that the F&B Committee takes into account the diverse needs and interests of the student body when evaluating funding requests, aiming to support a wide range of programs and activities to enrich the campus community. ""We have a financial policy, and as long as any of the requests they make are within the guidelines of our financial policy, then they're basically good to go ""¶ we normally try to directly fund undergraduate programs since the undergrads are paying this A.S. fee, so that's one of the stipulations that we'll look for is just serving undergrads the best way possible,""ù Tran said. In addition to overseeing funding for clubs and organizations, F&B also works to propose budgets for various A.S. departments across campus.  ""We directly work with trying to propose budgets for things like the Food Bank. A lot of the [boards, committees and units] that you see if you go to the A.S. office are one of the departments that we have. Anything A.S. touches is the budget we help control/propose for the next fiscal year,""ù Tran said. Total A.S. Budget has drastically increased over the past ten years, with the current 2023-2024 school year having a budget near $16 million. (Bowie Chuang / Daily Nexus) As of this 2023-2024 school year, the overall A.S. budget has drastically increased over the past 10 years. This increase correlates with a larger student body ""î from around 19,500 in the 2014-15 school year to around 22,500 in the 2023-24 school year. The increase in budget has resulted in increased funding for various A.S. departments. Crystal Bach, a fourth-year sociology major and the Administration Coordinator for the A.S. Food Bank said that additional funding has greatly enabled the Food Bank to expand its services and better support the student community. ""In the 23-24 school year, the A.S. Food Bank had a budget of $740,000. This sum grew from the 2022-2023 school year by approximately $200,000, from $520,000. The year prior to that, we received $430,000,""ù Bach said.† ""The Food Bank has steadily increased in funding over the past few years to fund our growing operations. Thanks to this increase in funding, we have been able to increase our reach by operating and funding special programs,""ù Bach said.† Bach highlights the impact of A.S. funding and how it has helped foster student organizations and programs on the UCSB campus.† ""A.S. funds help us maintain our operations to serve our student population ""¶ we hope that highlighting these aspects of our organization creates a sense of ownership for all students and de-stigmatizes utilizing our services,""ù Bach said.†
