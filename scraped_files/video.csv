video,"Students, Santa Barbarans, Local Politicians Participate in Women's March for Reproductive Rights",7-Oct-21,12:11 PM,"['Atmika Iyer', 'Holly Rusch']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-07/students-santa-barbarans-local-politicians-participate-in-womens-march-for-reproductive-rights/,"Thousands of people across the country marched on Oct. 2 to advocate for reproductive rights, following a Texas law that restricts abortion access. The local marches ""î†organized by the Women's March organization ""î†took place in downtown Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. UC Santa Barbara students primarily attended the march in downtown Santa Barbara.†  Students, county residents and local politicians all gathered at De La Guerra Plaza at noon prior to the march. World Dance for Humanity danced to various famous anthems of female empowerment, including Aretha Franklin's ""Respect""ù and Meghan Trainor's ""Woman Up.""ù Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus After the dancers dispersed, local advocates spoke to the crowd about the importance of reproductive rights. Speakers included Annette Cordero of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, State Senator Monique Lim√≥n, Central Coast Planned Parenthood CEO Jenna Tosh and former State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.† Cordero stood in front of the crowd alongside her family members and other members of the Coastal Band and discussed the importance of inclusivity and addressing intersectionality within advocacy for reproductive rights.† Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus ""We want to make sure that we are inclusive, that we include queer [people], the whole gambit of LGBTQIA[+]. In our tradition, two-spirited people were usually honored and considered highly respected members of our community, so we also want to make sure that we honor two-spirited people,""ù Cordero said.† Cordero's niece Kelly added to the discussion of inclusivity and intersectionality within advocacy for reproductive rights.† ""Not all people with uteruses are women,""ù Kelly said. ""Not all pussies are pink either. We're here in solidarity because they're trying to take control of us, and it's not going to happen.""ù† Lim√≥n's speech discussed the impact of the new Texas law on the residents of the state. Lim√≥n shared the story of a pregnant woman whose child has anencephaly ""î a fatal condition where the child is missing parts of its brain. The mother was unable to get an abortion in Texas and had to fly out of state, NPR reported.† Pia Ramos / Daily Nexus ""We know for a fact that [the new Texas law] will not reduce abortions, that this will reduce safe abortions and require women to seek unsafe alternatives,""ù Lim√≥n said. ""This is the reality of what is at stake.""ù† Lim√≥n added that in 2021, ""over 600 laws restricting abortions have been introduced in this country.""ù† Tosh followed Lim√≥n's speech, highlighting the various laws and restrictions on abortion throughout the country.† Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus ""Roe v. Wade is hanging on by a thread. Abortion is effectively illegal in a U.S. state for the first time since 1973. In December, the Supreme Court will hear a direct attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade,""ù Tosh said. ""If they do overturn it, 26 states will likely ban abortion before the end of next year. These states are home to 36 million women of reproductive age and even more trans men and gender nonconforming and nonbinary people who stand to lose their constitutional right to a safe and legal abortion.""ù† ""Nearly half of U.S. people who can become pregnant could lose their reproductive rights overnight,""ù Tosh continued.† Next was Jackson, who discussed the Supreme Court's regard for stare decisis ""î†a legal doctrine requiring courts to abide by the precedent set by previous cases. In this situation, the set precedent would be from Roe v. Wade.† Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus ""So what do we do? We have a Supreme Court now that has disrespected the notion of what they call stare decisis ""î†accepting the laws that existed. We knew this was going to happen,""ù Jackson said. ""The senate at the time allowed sexual harassers on the court, they allowed people who have lied and committed perjury in their hearings saying they would honor stare decisis and they have not. We need to take action.""ù† After all the speeches, the marchers, including UCSB students, took to State Street ""î†chanting and marching to the end of Anapamu Street right by the Santa Barbara County Administration Building.† ""I've been studying history a lot, especially repressed and totalitarian environments. And I don't want to live in one, to be honest,""ù said first-year economics major and march attendee Dexter Laviolette. ""I think we should do everything we can to make sure we preserve our freedoms and rights, whether they're legal or not.""ù ""We should remember that everything the government does anywhere is with the consent of the governed,""ù he continued. ""As long as we stay conscious and do not give them our consent, they cannot do anything we don't want them to.""ù Carly Lankarani, a first-year history of art and architecture major who attended the march with LaViolette, concurred that students and community members alike should remain aware of current events and advocate for women's rights.† ""I'm just staying aware of current issues. Do your part, if you're able to, go out and vote; if not, pre-register to vote, just pay attention to politics, do what you can on campus, or even, like, your local community, make sure the word gets out,""ù she said.† ""Women's rights are human rights. Don't forget it.""ù† In an interview with the Nexus, Lim√≥n congratulated high school- and college-aged marchers for being civically engaged and fighting for their rights.† ""Kudos, kudos for caring about your rights now, whether you can vote or not. It's about caring, and ensuring that your voice ""î†because you're the next generation of leaders ""î†is represented at the table,""ù Lim√≥n said. ""So thank you to all of the women ""î†young and older and everything in between ""î who have showed up [and] to the allies because it's about showing that this community is backing reproductive health choices.""ù † A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Oct. 7, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus. Correction [10/07/21 5:12 pm]: A previous version of this article that appeared in print incorrectly spelled UCSB student Carly Lankarani's last name as ""òLinkrani' and did not capitalize the ""òV' in UCSB student Dexter LaViolette's last name.

Print So, are you OK with higher tuition to pay for the pay raises? Interesting how there is always virtually unlimited money available for war and corporate bailouts, but not for paying working people what they need and deserve. I'll gladly pay higher tuition to help keep the place clean. What's the alternative, a messy campus? Give them what they deserve to be able to live.

video,For the Love of the Game: The Resurgence of Gabe Vincent,3-Mar-18,3:22 PM,"['Jorge Mercado', 'Andy Lau', 'Sean White']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/for-the-love-of-the-game-the-resurgence-of-gabe-vincent/,"Feb. 2, 2017, was another normal night for the UCSB men's basketball team. In the midst of its worst season under then-Head Coach Bob Williams, the team hosted CSUF with an abysmal 3-16 overall mark and just one win in conference play. The one thing UCSB had going for them was guard Gabe Vincent. At the time, Vincent was the team's leading scorer, averaging 14.8 points per game, and added along 3.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. His 51 threes were the most on the team and, just a week and a half earlier, he had become the 28th Gaucho to score 1,000 points in a career. The point is, Vincent was good. The former Big West Freshman of the Year and All-Big West Honorable Mention was still having a great season despite his teams' poor play. SETBACK Going up against Fullerton, Vincent was still showing the same fire he showed all season. Nothing was going to stop the Stockton, Calif. native;† not if he had anything to say about it, at least. Unfortunately for him, there was nothing he could do about what happened late in the first half. Gabe Vincent dribbles to the basket. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After driving into the lane, Vincent jumped in the air and drew the foul, but when he fell, he landed awkwardly on his left knee. The crowd quieted down, the coaching staff looked worried, and Vincent went to the bench with a grimacing look. UCSB would go on to lose the match 79-53, and worse, the Gauchos feared that they would lose Vincent for the remainder of the season. Their fears were realized just one day later when an MRI revealed he had suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and would be sidelined for a minimum of six-to-eight months. Vincent said that all he could think about was, ""How soon can I play again?""ù ""I never really second-guessed [the timetable] I was given. It took me a few weeks to really process what was going on, but after that I went through the motions of trying to come back and getting healthy.""ù For Coach Williams, the injury hurt him just the same. After all, he was the man that recruited Vincent to UCSB. ""I am heartbroken for Gabe and the team,""ù Williams said to UCSB Athletics. ""He's been a stud for three years and has also become our team's leader. Knowing Gabe, I believe he will bounce back from this and be stronger than ever.""ù Williams got it right with that last statement. CHANGE Once the 2017 season ended, Vincent was met with the bad news that his senior season would come with the shellshock of having to work with an entirely new coaching staff. Following a disappointing 6-22 season and missing the Big West Tournament, the university decided not to extend Williams's contract and go in a different direction. While obviously saddened by the news, Vincent knew he had his own worries that he needed to take care of. ""It really hurt a lot; me and Bob [Williams] were close, and he recruited me, and he was a big part of the reason I came to UCSB,""ù Vincent said. ""With that being said, that's how this business goes, and we knew we had to move forward, and we responded well.""ù While coming back from an ACL tear is nothing new in this day and age thanks to wonderful medical advances, it is still a long grind, and not everyone returns to peak form. To Vincent's credit, he never thought negatively. He put his head down and worked every single day to be ready come the season opener in 2018. ""Every day was a struggle. I don't think there is anyone that has been hurt in that way who can tell you it is easy,""ù Vincent said. ""It's not a fun process, not easy, but you just have to take it day by day. You have good days and bad days, but at the end you're working to come back.""ù And while Vincent was working hard, the UCSB administrative staff was working hard as well, hoping to add another great basketball coach to the rotation. On April 4, UCSB introduced Joe Pasternack as their new head coach, and right away he went to work adding graduate transfers Marcus Jackson and Leland King II. Along with the additions, Pasternack was adamant about bringing his new philosophy to this team and bring a new attitude. Most importantly, he wanted to bring a new culture, one that ""honors the process.""ù ""Coach Pasternack did a great job of bringing in a great staff and great guys like Marcus and Leland to help us compete,""ù Vincent said. ""He is a real competitor and he loves to win, and that's what he is all about.""ù All this constant activity and excitement only made the former St. Mary's High School standout anxious. RESURGENCE Still, all his hard work would pay off as on Saturday, Nov. 11, Vincent returned right on schedule to start the season opener against North Dakota State. While breakout sophomore guard Max Heidegger stole the stage with an astonishing 33 points in the Gauchos 85-66 win, Vincent was still there, playing as hard as ever. The senior would finish the night with seven points and a career high of eight assists on just 17 minutes. ""My greatest memory [in these last four years] is probably my first game back from injury,""ù Vincent said. ""Suiting back up with the guys again after something that happened so tragically, and in the midst of such a terrible season, to turning it around to what this season has become is unbelievable.""ù Coming back after a torn left ACL, Gabe Vincent jumps for the hoop. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus As games kept coming and going, Vincent and the Gauchos would just get better and better. Against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome, a game that was televised on ESPNU, Vincent stole the show. The senior dropped a then season-high 21 points on the Anteaters and led the Gauchos to a primetime win. Even better, it was his first full game without his knee brace, as it broke just a few nights earlier against, coincidentally enough, Cal State Fullerton. ""I planned on getting out of the brace a week later so really it just came early; so it was different, but it worked out well, and now I feel stronger and stronger every day,""ù Vincent said. Fast-forward to the current day, and UCSB has more than tripled its win total from the last season with a 21-7 overall mark and is currently fighting for first place in the conference standings heading into the final week of the regular season. From six wins to 21, this season has been a complete 180 for Vincent. ""It is special. I mean, this group we have in general is special. They are a big part of the reason why I wanted to get back so quickly ""¶ because I saw the potential this team had,""ù Vincent said. ""Now we just have to finish this the right way and set out what we wanted to accomplish at the beginning of the year.""ù Like Vincent said at the end, however, the mission is still not over. The Gauchos still have goals of winning the Big West Tournament and making an NCAA run. That doesn't mean the former Big West Freshman of the Year shouldn't enjoy his final home games, though. In a 70-69 loss against LBSU on Thursday, Vincent scored a career high 28 points. The loss may have overshadowed Vincent's new career high, but if Thursday highlighted anything, it is that Vincent is back and he will be a problem come tournament time. The senior is now averaging 12.6 points per game, on a career high 45 percent shooting heading into his final game at the Thunderdome to culminate what will be a spectacular career. ""To be honest, this whole season has been pretty emotional, coming back from injury, day by day knowing it's my last season, so things have been building up,""ù Vincent said. ""I'm sure it will be emotional, but I just have to harness it into a good game.""ù RIVALRY/FINALE As luck would have it, Vincent's final home game will be Saturday against the Gauchos biggest rival, Cal Poly. The Mustangs stole the first meeting between the Blue-Green rivals, 80-79. ""The rivalry is real; I don't know how else to put it. Even being at SLO is just different,""ù Vincent said. ""But I am happy to compete against them again, especially after dropping that last game. It was my first loss to Cal Poly during my time here. I took it real personally, so I am excited to get them back over here.""ù With Saturday marking the end of Vincent's brilliant career, one might surmise that he wants to be the one to steal the show. But those who know him personally know that Vincent is as humble as they come. ""It's going to be just another game. If I go off, I go off, and if I don't, I don't, but as long as we get a win at the end of the day,""ù Vincent said. Beyond this season, if there is one thing Vincent loves, it is basketball. This will not be his final stop, something he is very adamant about. ""NBA is the dream, always has been and definitely is not something I plan on giving up on now,""ù Vincent said. ""Even if I can't make it, this is still going to be my career. I have to make money somehow so whether it be overseas or G-League, I am just going to be excited to continue my career.""ù If there is one thing this piece highlights, it is that Vincent is as resilient as they come. The senior is going to leave behind quite a legacy here at UCSB, and yet, all he wants to be remembered as is ""a good teammate and a guy that loves to compete and win.""ù That will not be a problem, Gabe.

video,"In a Reopening Roller Coaster, Barber Shops Are Cutting Profits Thin",7-Aug-20,11:53 AM,['Max Abrams'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-07/in-a-reopening-roller-coaster-barber-shops-are-cutting-profits-thin/,"Richie Ramirez first locked the doors of his barber shops in Isla Vista and Montecito in late March, alongside numerous other businesses in Santa Barbara County that were forced to temporarily close under Governor Gavin Newsom's stay-at-home orders.† He looked forward to reopening soon but didn't expect the cycle to keep repeating itself.† Since the beginning of the pandemic, Ramirez said he has shuttered and reopened his barber shops three separate times, turning a profit for only six weeks out of the last six months.† ""Every time we reopen, we're basically restarting the business,""ù Ramirez said.† Under guidance from the California Public Health Department and the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology, Ramirez has again reopened, albeit with a stipulation ""î he and his barbers must serve clients outside.† Now, Ramirez and his barbers cut, trim and shave their clients' heads on the sidewalk under a tent and with significantly fewer chairs.† Though he has been able to reopen both barber shop locations, the reopenings haven't come without their caveats. Fewer chairs and no waiting space means less money, Ramirez said, noting that he can usually fit five customers in his I.V. location at once, which was often booked to capacity. Now he can only serve three customers at a time.† While the number of customers he and his barbers can serve has dwindled, his denominator ""î the price of rent ""î remains unchanged.†† Now, he's looking to the local landlords to ask what provisions can be made for struggling small businesses.† ""We're on the sidewalk cutting hair, but the rent remains the same,""ù Ramirez said. ""At what point do the landlords step in and say ""òHey, we're going to help you guys'?""ù ""I understand that they have mortgages and bills to pay,""ù he added. ""[But] they're my business partner. They haven't even called me.""ù Operating outdoors limits his business to 30% capacity, Ramirez said. One way to increase capacity is to bring business back inside, though he's uncertain when he can legally do so.† But even moving operations indoors again wouldn't promise steady business for the barber shops, Mariay Tsushima, barber and manager at Richie's Barber Shop I.V., said.† Business is largely contingent on the population of UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College students that normally reside in I.V., which has sharply declined as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent departure of students who returned home.† ""This is a great job when we have school,""ù she said.† But Tsushima said Richie's Barber Shop is not alone in the challenges it is facing. She said ""a lot of bigger-name""ù hair and beauty businesses throughout the state have vented their frustrations with the outdoor policy on social media. Working outside makes some services, such as highlighting or coloring, impractical without being able to wash the hair first, she said, sending a rift through the business models. As a result, some industry professionals have put down their aprons and clippers in favor of a career with more stability, Tsushima said.† ""I know of people who have had to quit and then just go work whatever they used to do, like serving or construction,""ù she said. ""Just something other than this.""ù Instability can wreak havoc on small businesses, Ramirez said, adding that strained support from patrons and the government worsens the problem.† Despite the new changes to operations, Ramirez said, customers still seem willing to come in for their normal services, all of which are priced the same as they were before the pandemic.††† ""Overall, people are happy. I think they're a little confused as to why we're outside. A lot of people think we are doing this by choice,""ù he said, ""but we're not.""ù Ramirez said Santa Barbara County and state government public health departments sent him conflicting messages and last-minute warnings throughout the pandemic, creating an environment in which he feels as if ""it's almost like they don't care about small business.""ù ""The day before we shut down ""î that's when we got our heads up,""ù Ramirez said. ""I never received an email, I never received a phone call, I never received anything saying that ""òHey, you guys are gonna have shut that down.'""ù† Nancy Anderson, assistant county executive officer, said in an email to the Nexus that the onus is on small businesses to self-certify through an online program, otherwise ""we do not have direct contact information to notify them of guidance""ù and upcoming mandates.†† Anderson attributed communication delays between the county and local businesses to the fact that local governments learn about new state-imposed changes ""at the same time as the general public,""ù which can take several days to trickle down and implement at the county level.† ""For example, Hair Salons and Barbershops are regulated by the State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology that initially indicated that these businesses could not operate outside when indoor operations were closed,""ù she said. ""It took them about two days to find an alternative to this for these businesses and they issued additional guidance for them.""ù† Though his business physically and financially isn't where it was six months ago, Ramirez said he and his staff are happy to be open and have no plans to shut down unless told to do so.† Until his tent comes down, he said, customers can ""get a haircut from a barbershop they trust.""ù

video,Students and County Residents March Against ExxonMobil's New Oil Trucking Plan,3-Oct-21,10:00 AM,['Atmika Iyer'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-03/students-and-county-residents-march-against-exxonmobils-new-oil-trucking-plan/,"In response to ExxonMobil's request to the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission to begin trucking oil on Route 166 and Highway 101, environmental groups across Santa Barbara ""î including several student groups at UC Santa Barbara ""î protested against ExxonMobil by marching from the Santa Barbara County Administration to the Santa Barbara News Press on Sept. 24.†  On Sept. 29, the planning commission ""î†in a 3-2 vote ""î asked its staff to come back with reasons for recommending denial of ExxonMobil's request. The planning commission will hear the findings of the report on Nov. 3.† In early 2020, some of these protesting groups and people ""î many of whom were present at the march ""î formed a coalition called Exxon, Be Gone. This coalition against ExxonMobil's initiatives includes the Sunrise Santa Barbara Movement, California Environmental Justice Alliance, Wishtoyo Chumash Foundation, UCSB Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, 350 Santa Barbara, Center for Biological Diversity, Environmental Defense Center, Food and Water Action, Get Oil Out, Santa Barbara County Action Network, the Los Padres Chapter of the Sierra Club, the Surfrider Foundation Santa Barbara County Chapter and UCSB External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan.† ExxonMobil's request came to the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission in 2020. The oil corporation hoped to truck oil until they could replace this method with the Plains All American Pipeline for their drilling projects. The pipeline has been non-operational since May 2015, when it leaked into the Santa Barbara Channel. The oil company's initial proposition stated that the trucking would end once a pipeline became available or after a seven-year period, depending on which came first. The trucking path would be from the ExxonMobil Las Flores Canyon facility to either the Phillips 66 Santa Maria Pump Station (SMPS) or the Plains Pentland Terminal and would involve 70 trucks per day, according to the most recent environmental impact report (EIR). Each truck would carry 5,040 to 6,720 gallons of oil.† However, the hearings for the implementation of the trucking path ""î which were supposed to take place on Sept. 2 and Sept. 9, 2020 ""î were delayed because of ExxonMobil's decision to shut down their Santa Maria location in Arroyo Grande by 2023, an obstruction which led to the project's temporary hiatus. Now, ExxonMobil is back with their trucking request to the Santa Barbara Planning Commission, which will be heard Sept. 29 and Oct. 1.† Students and community members at the downtown Santa Barbara march pointed to the orange-tinged skies around them ""î as a result of fires north of Santa Barbara County ""î as an example of what will happen to the environment should companies like ExxonMobil continue their dependency on fossil fuels.† ""There's ash in the sky. The sun looks awful. I feel like this is really telling, seeing this backdrop, the signs we're holding right now, everyone gathered here ""î†it's just a message on how bad climate change has gotten,""ù second-year cultural anthropology major and protest attendee Emily Zomoroudi said.† This slideshow requires JavaScript. The protestors marched through downtown Santa Barbara chanting, ""No more Exxon, no more oil. Keep the carbon in the soil,""ù ""Climate change is not a lie. Do not let our planet die,""ù and ""Hey hey, ho ho, ExxonMobil's got to go.""ù† This slideshow requires JavaScript. According to third-year environmental studies major and Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-Chair Kat Lane, the Society of Fearless Grandmothers Santa Barbara ""î who coordinated the protest ""î reached out to environmental advocacy student groups at UCSB for their help in demonstrating against ExxonMobil's trucking proposal. Lane and other students then sent information on the protest to professors teaching classes on environmental studies and advertised the protest on social media.† ""We're out here today not only because oil is going to be detrimental to our environment, but also because this is a water issue. It's an issue about people getting access to clean water, to clean food, it's about respecting the Chumash indigenous wishes,""ù Lane said.†† Fourth-year biochemistry and environmental studies double major and EAB member Soham Ray said that the EAB has been keeping track of EIRs and general updates with ExxonMobil's proposal. Ray said this project is dangerous for the county in multiple ways.† ""The trucking project in general is dangerous for Santa Barbara, for the Santa Barbara locals, and also, the youth. Our community [and] the world should be focused on taking climate change seriously, and making sure that companies that contributed the most to this problem like Exxon[Mobil] don't continue to pull oil out of the ground and burn it down just to meet their bottom line,""ù Ray said.† Ray added that he hopes big corporations and politicians hear students' messages and outcry against ExxonMobil's trucking plan.† ""Students are serious because this is our future and we have to care about it. We can't just allow big corporations or politicians ""î†like the planning commission ""î†decide on if we get to have a liveable future or not. It's up to us to communicate to [big corporations and politicians] and help them understand that this is our future we're fighting for,""ù he said.†† Nadia Abushanab,†UCSB 2020 alumna, was also at the protest as an organizer with the Santa Barbara County Action Network. Abushanab said that there are three primary points the action network hopes to convey.† ""The first is that climate change is real, and we cannot afford to drill any more oil ""¶ The second one is that an oil spill is a real possibility that could happen. In the last five years, there have been five oil spills on the route they want to truck oil on, and it's right next to the river. We can't afford to harm our ecosystem, our marine life or wildlife,""ù Abushanab said. ""The third thing is that that road is very dangerous. So much so that the staff [report] actually recommended against it in their recommendation last year.""ù† The Environmental Defense Center (EDC), a group within the coalition, has been providing ""substantive analysis of the scientific information, [and] the legal analysis on the technical information,""ù according to Exxon, Be Gone member and Chief Counsel for the Environmental Defense Center Linda Krop. Krop expressed concern over the initial EIR, which only asked that trucking be suspended during rainy periods.† The EDC researched accidents in Santa Barbara County and California involving oil trucking from 2000 and discovered accidents ""involving explosions, spills [and] injuries.""ù The EDC noted that many of the accidents were the result of other cars crashing into the truck, and not the other way around. Throughout all of their research, they discovered around 70 accidents involving the rain. Krop emphasized that just because there was rain in a few accidents, that doesn't mean that the weather was ""necessarily related""ù to the cause or impact of the accident.† The original staff report for the SBCPC, however, went further to then recommend that Route 166 be excluded from the trucking request. Unlike the EIR, the report looked at the likelihood of accidents on Route 166 specifically and saw that the likelihood of an accident on this route is greater than what the EIR calculated. This is because the EIR used national averages for their analysis of likelihood of accidents, instead of accidents on Route 166 specifically. The most recent staff report, however, does not ask for Route 166 to be excluded.† The EDC recently published a blog post outlining the dangers of allowing ExxonMobil to truck oil in Santa Barbara County, which explained that there have been at least 79 tanker crashes in California during the last 21 years. The accidents have resulted in the death of 28 people and the injuries of 56. Over 100,000 gallons of oil were spilled leading to the impairment of several ecosystems.†† The EDC also pointed out in the blog post that there was an oil spill as recently as March 21, 2020 where a tanker truck on Route 166 was overturned ""causing 6,600 gallons of crude oil to spill into the Cuyama River, ten miles away from Twitchell Dam and reservoir. The spill harmed wildlife, as several mallard ducks died and other animals, including turtles and birds, were rescued and cleaned up.""ù The Nexus will continue reporting on the county's decision regarding a potential, new trucking plan for ExxonMobil in Santa Barbara County.† A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Sept. 23, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The UCSB women's basketball team dropped its second consecutive match after losing to UC Davis, 68-61 at home Wednesday night. UCSB now drops to 6-11 on the season, 3-2 in conference play while first place UCD now improves to 14-3 overall and a still unbeaten 4-0 mark in Big West play. Santa Barbara began the night off strong jumping out to a very early 15-8 lead following six points from junior forward Drew Edelman. However, UC Davis would bounce back with two baskets before the end of the quarter to only go down three points heading into the second. The Aggies then took their first lead of the night following a 4-0 run to begin the second to take the lead at 16-15 before Tal Sahar nailed a three to put the Gauchos back on top. After that however, it was all UC Davis who used a 16-6 run until the end of the second to take a 32-24 lead into the break. In the first quarter, the Gauchos had redshirt Morgan Bertsch held to zero points, but the Aggies star came alive in the second scoring eight points to help give her team the eight-point lead heading into the break. The third quarter began with UCSB and UC Davis trading buckets. With around four minutes remaining in the third, and UCSB down four, the Gauchos put together an 8-0 run to take a 48-43 lead. Like the first, the Aggies scored the final four points of the quarter to go down by just one heading into the fourth. Much like the second, in the final frame, Santa Barbara just could not buy a basket. After a make by senior guard Drea Toler which made the score 50-47 with 8:04 on the clock, UC Davis scored the next 12 points, fueled by a pair of three-pointers from junior guard Karley Eaton, to go up 59-50. UCSB tried to fight back with three points from freshman guard Sarah Bates and Toler but UC Davis was great from the charity stripe down the stretch, sealing the Gauchos fate as they lost 68-61 at the final buzzer. Neither team shot the three-ball particularly well, with the Gauchos hitting on just 25 percent (7-for-28) while the Aggies went 4-for-23 (17.4 percent) from beyond the arc. Overall, UC Davis went 26-for-58 (44.8 percent) from the field compared to a 33.9 percent (21-for-62) shooting night for UCSB. Bertsch, despite shooting under her season average, still tallied a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds and was a huge factor down the strech. Following two straight losses, albeit competitive ones, the Gauchos now know they need to make some quick fixes if they dont want to fall into a deep losing streak like they did earlier this season. Luckily, the return of a guard like Toler could provide the offense a much needed passing boost. She finished with a team-high 15 points in her home debut. UCSB is back in action on Saturday against Long Beach State.
