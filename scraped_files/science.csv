science,Certification May Help Conservation Efforts,25-Jan-18,1:36 AM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/certification-may-help-conservation-efforts/,"As Earth's population grows, so does the demand for agricultural commodities such as cotton, corn, rice and others. This has put a strain on forests around the world. While many corporations and countries have made efforts to only purchase and produce sustainable products, it remains unclear how successful these methods have been. In a new study by UC Santa Barbara, economist Robert Heilmayr and colleagues were able to estimate the effect of sustainable certification, specifically for palm oil, on Indonesian plantations. They found that certification reduced deforestation among participating plantations. However, certification was mostly adopted in older plantations that contained little remaining forest. Broader adoption by palm oil growers is needed for certification to have a large impact on total forest area lost to palm oil expansion. Sustainability certification is the tool most used by corporations to fulfill procurement policies, and around 20 percent of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2017. ""RSPO certification has saved 21 square kilometers of Indonesian forests that would have been deforested,""ù Heilmayr, an assistant professor in UCSB's environmental studies program and co-lead author, said. ""To put that in perspective, that area is one-tenth the size of the home range of a Bornean elephant endangered partially by loss of its habitat due to deforestation.""ù To evaluate whether certification fulfills such pledges, Heilmayr and colleagues applied statistical analyses to satellite-based estimates of tree cover loss to infer the causal impact of a third-party certification system on deforestation and fire within Indonesian oil palm plantations. Heilmayr combined a new database of Indonesian oil palm plantations with satellite imagery of deforestation. The investigators then measured the amount of natural forest that was cleared in each of those plantations between 2000 and 2015. They estimated that RSPO certification reduced, but did not eliminate, deforestation in certified Indonesian plantations by about 30 percent, as compared to their non-certified counterparts with similar characteristics. Above is a map of the palm oil plantations the research group kept track of. Plantation area totaled 187,567 km2. About 53 percent of the total certified area was in Sumatra, including the Bangka Belitung Islands, on the left, and 47 percent was in Kalimantan, which is on the right. / Courtesy of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The researchers also found that certification did not affect fire occurrence in these plantations or the amount of carbon-rich peat swamp forests cleared and drained for palm oil. ""We were pleased to see this positive effect, given that nongovernmental organizations have substantiated real cases of deforestation within plantations held by RSPO members,""ù Kimberly Carlson, of the University of Hawaii and co-lead author, said. ""However, because palm oil companies have chosen initially to certify well-established plantations containing relatively few remaining forests, certification currently benefits less than one percent of the forests remaining in Indonesian oil palm plantations.""ù Thus, RSPO certification provides an indicator to guide customers toward palm oil purchases associated with lower recent loss of high tree cover and primary forests, as well as fire incidence. They also found that lower deforestation embodied in certified products resulted largely from certification that skewed toward plantations with few remaining forests. The significant impact of certification on deforestation indicates that higher levels of certification could generate greater forest protection. The RSPO is under pressure to meet recent pledges by corporations and palm oil-importing countries to source only deforestation and peat-free palm oil. To enable compliance with procurement policies, the RSPO would need to develop a clear definition of ""deforestation""ù that can be monitored using remote sensing. Remote monitoring of conservation set-asides, supported by ground-truth assessments, could demonstrate compliance. The principles would need to be revised to require that certified supply bases were not developed from peatlands and areas defined as forest. However, such changes would likely increase the cost of certification, which threatens to exclude producers, especially small and medium-size growers, from the RSPO. If membership stays stagnant or declines, the RSPO's impact on forest conservation and other critical sustainability concerns in the oil palm sector, such as workers' safety and water pollution, may decrease. Currently, the RSPO NEXT standard allows producers that wish to meet zero deforestation commitments to become certified as no deforestation, no peat and no fire. Such tiered standards may be preferable if the goal is to retain and gain RSPO members. Our research indicates that palm oil producers currently have few incentives to expand the area of forest under their control. It is difficult to align individual corporate decisions with broader conservation goals, such as halting tropical deforestation. Positive incentives for forest protection, such as a price premium linked to forest conservation, may increase forest area preserved through certification. With around 20 percent of all global palm oil now certified, the RSPO has great potential to influence tropical land change. Whether or not Roundtable members embrace higher levels of stringency and transparency around land use change, and how such changes might affect incentives for RSPO membership will determine palm oil certification's contribution to tropical forest conservation.

science,Zayed Energy Prize Highlights Nakamura‚'s Research,25-Jan-18,1:40 AM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/zayed-energy-prize-highlights-nakamuras-research/,"Awards for innovation in light technology are nothing new for Shuji Nakamura. Nakamura, a professor of Materials and Electrical & Computer Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, has received the Zayed Future Energy Prize's Lifetime Achievement award for pioneering the development of white L.E.D. lights, an innovation that will have reduced electricity consumption in the U.S. by an estimated 348 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2027, saving more than $30 billion. ""The 2018 Zayed Future Energy Award recognizes the global impact of solid-state lighting technology on both the climate and the citizens of our planet, and I am honored that my work in this field is again being highlighted,""ù Nakamura said. A winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, Nakamura is one of three individuals credited for creating the highly sought bright-blue L.E.D. That advance paved the way for the white L.E.D, technology that is now at the heart of many energy-efficient applications, including interior and exterior lighting, displays and automotive headlamps. Shuji Nakamura has been a professor of Materials and Electrical & Computer Engineering at the UC Santa Barbara since 2000. He holds more than 200 US patents and over 300 Japanese patents. He is currently the Research Director of the Solid State Lighting & Energy Electronics. / Courtesy of ssleec.ucsb.edu The use of L.E.D. lights has revolutionized energy savings, making it possible to reduce fossil fuel use and carbon footprints. Their durability has also enabled the provision of lighting under inhospitable conditions and in places where traditional energy infrastructure is not available. Nakamura's research fits perfectly with the idea that motivated the creation of the prize. The world is in desperate need of innovative solutions to create a new, sustainable energy future. No one knows from where or whom the next great energy solution will come from. Solutions and technologies that could change the world are being developed globally, and the $4 million Zayed Future Energy Prize, managed by Masdar in Abu Dhabi, is ready to recognize and reward innovators like Nakamura. Nakamura received his award at a ceremony held in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, as part of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week. Now in its 10th year, the Zayed Future Energy Prize is the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) global awards program for renewable energy and sustainability pioneers. The prize came to fruition as a result of the vision of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the late ruler of Abu Dhabi and founding father of the United Arab Emirates. At the 2008 World Future Energy Summit, his Highness General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the UAE, announced The Zayed Future Energy Prize, to honor his father's legacy of environmental stewardship. The prize annually recognizes innovations and leadership in sustainability achieved by large corporations, small and medium enterprises, nonprofit organizations, dedicated individuals and high schools from five different world regions. Previous winners include former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Toyota Motor Corp. and Bronx Design & Construction Academy.

science,Maze Runner Redefined,1-Feb-18,1:38 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/maze-runner-redefined/,"In a three-by-three inch maze containing milk and a pool of red dye, drops of liquid soap are added, propelling the dye forward. The dye doesn't just spread out to every corridor, but instead travels knowingly, continuously moving and taking sharp turns until it reaches the end of the maze. It has correctly solved it. So what's the explanation behind this phenomenon? It involves the Marangoni effect, which occurs when a gradient of surface tension exists at an interface between two states of matter, such as two liquids. Another instance in which you might observe the Marangoni effect is tears running down the walls of a glass of wine after you swirl it. Surface tension refers to the property created by bonds among molecules of liquid, allowing the liquid to resist an external force. Higher surface tension means the bonds are stronger and the liquid is more resistant. It's how insects can walk on water, and it's what gives water droplets their round shape. The soap is a surfactant, or a substance that lowers local surface tension when it's between two fluids. By targeting areas of higher surface tension ahead of its path in the maze, the soap (and dye) move forward and create a Marangoni force. The maze experiment is a joint project between UCSB researchers and Julien Landel and Oliver Jensen at the University of Manchester, as well as Fran√ßois Peaudecerf at ETH Zurich. / Courtesy of Fernando Temprano-Coleto ""The intermolecular forces of substances matter when you have an interface between two fluids because when you add soap, the attractive forces between two molecules of soap are locally weaker and the attractive forces between molecules of water on the other side are stronger,""ù Fernando Temprano-Coleto, a UC Santa Barbara graduate student and one of the researchers who worked on the project, said. ""The surface tension decreases around the area where you put the drop [of soap], and the imbalance in the average strength of intermolecular forces between two substances causes the soap to expand, inducing force and, therefore, motion.""ù While the milk was used mainly for color contrast in demonstrating the Marangoni effect, it helped in other ways as well. ""We found out milk has some nice properties, likely chemical ones, that allow the Marangoni effect to be sustained for longer amounts of time because it is an extremely complex substance. It's a colloid that never settles and it's not such a pure liquid as water,""ù Temprano-Coleto said. However, he points out that the Marangoni effect demonstrated in the maze is not limited to just milk, as tests with water have shown it works all the same.
As for how the soap appears to know which directions to take to solve the maze, Temprano-Coleto says the results tested the researchers' hypothesis of how the soap interacts with pre-existing surfactants in the fluid. When the soap tries to advance in a channel in the maze, it compresses the channel as it pushes the endogenous surfactants ahead of its path. This increases the soap's concentration as the surface area decreases, and creates a counter-Marangoni effect resistant to the soap's front. ""Therefore, the path with the largest surface area is the path that allows the front to push most without compacting the surfactants that are already there. That's why [the soap] chooses that path, because it's the path of least resistance,""ù Temprano-Coleto said. The project resulted in Temprano-Coleto, his co-advisors, UCSB mechanical engineering professors Frederic Gibou and Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz as well as Fran√ßois Peaudecerf from the University of Cambridge and Julien Landel from the University of Manchester, winning an award from the American Physical Society's (APS) Gallery of Fluid Motion after they submitted a video of their project. ""We wanted to show that geometry matters in Marangoni flows and that trace amounts of surfactants matter in these kinds of flows ""î not only in mazes like this, but in drag reactions, in superhydrophobic surfaces and so on,""ù Temprano-Coleto said. ""It was a fun thing we came up with to prove our points, and it turned out to be great. We were able to win an award from the APS, and we're pretty happy about it.""ù

science,Vulnerabilities Found in Cancer Persister Cells,1-Feb-18,1:41 AM,['Kelly Shi'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/vulnerabilities-found-in-cancer-persister-cells/,"Postdoctoral scholar and seminar lecturer Matthew Hangauer recently presented his research on drug-resistant cancer cells, their underlying mechanisms and possible weaknesses. Every so often, guest lecturers like Hangauer are invited to share their research at special seminars offered at UC Santa Barbara. In this presentation, Hangauer and a team of UC San Francisco researchers discovered a common weakness in drug-resistant cancer cells, or ""persister cells.""ù When in an invasive state, persister cells were susceptible to ferroptosis, a form of cell death, triggered by the absence of a specific enzyme: glutathione peroxidase 4. These findings hold immense potential in a clinical setting. Up until recently, it was widely believed that drug resistance in cancer cells was genetic by nature. In other words, a few cancer cells would acquire drug resistance through mutations and produce a new drug-resistant population. The discovery of persister cells, however, showed a different perspective: a small percentage of tumorigenic cells actually exist in a dormant state, evade death and reactivate later. The non-genetic mechanisms by which persister cells form are still unclear. Hangauer and his colleagues began looking for differences in gene activities between persister cells and untreated cancer cells in a breast cancer cell line. A small percentage of cancer cells known as persister cells can reversibly enter a dormant state, resist treatments and cause tumor recurrence. The non-genetic mechanisms by which persister cells form are still unclear. / Courtesy of cancer.ucsf.edu For this project, Hangauer used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to provide information about gene expression levels. He noted that RNA sequencing is now widely adopted as the primary tool to assess gene expression in a high throughput manner. Hangauer and his team found that persister cells showed less gene expression for genes combating oxidative stress. They also found that persister cells depended on the GPX4 enzyme: GPX4 inhibitors triggered selective ferroptosis (cell damage/death by lipid peroxidation) in drug-treated persister cells, but did not affect parent cells in the breast cancer cell line. ""I focus on the discovery of genes, such as GPX4,""ù Hangauer said in an email, ""which can be exploited through novel drugs to eliminate residual tumors after initial successful therapy to prevent the recurrence of tumors later on.""ù To explore the limits of his initial findings, Hangauer's team also tried to replicate these results with different types of cancer. To his excitement, he observed similar outcomes in different types of cancer, such as melanoma, lung cancer and ovarian cancer. ""The next step is to develop a GPX4 chemical inhibitor that works in live animals,""ù Hangauer said. ""The current GPX4 inhibitors do not reach the GPX4 target in mice due to poor bioavailability.""ù For a pre-clinical experiment, Hangauer's team knocked down the GPX4 gene and observed tumor growth in mice, using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Similarly, mice in the control treatment (GPX4 present) experienced tumor recurrence while the mice in the experimental condition (GPX4 absent) did not. While these findings seem promising, there are still some issues to be addressed before viable treatments are made. For example, the GPX4 gene provides antioxidant defense mechanisms that protect cells from lipid peroxidation. It would be extremely harmful to animals if this gene were to be completely inhibited or removed. ""Once such a chemical inhibitor is available, then the efficacy and toxicity of GPX4 chemical inhibition can be assessed in animal models of cancer before entering human clinical trials,""ù Hangauer said. Hangauer hopes to develop therapeutic approaches to turn transient cancer therapy responses into permanent ones. The goal is to develop a chemical tool that can change the way oncologists understand and treat cancer. ""To do this, I seek to discover how cancer cells stay alive despite being exposed to potent cancer killing drugs, and to leverage this insight into new therapeutic strategies. The long-term goal is to carry these ideas all the way into the clinic in the form of novel therapies to provide benefit to cancer patients.""ù

science,Scaling New Heights,1-Feb-18,1:46 AM,['Jiaming Yang'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/scaling-new-heights/,"Shuji Nakamura, professor of Materials Department and Research Director for the Solid State Lighting & Energy Electronics Center at UC Santa Barbara, was awarded the 2018 Zayed Future Energy Prize for his great contribution to sustainability and new energy. When talking about this great honor he made recently, Nakamura was delighted and peaceful. ""It is obvious that I won many prizes for the invention of Blue L.E.D., but this prize proved how much Blue L.E.D. is contributed to sustainability and new areas.""ù
According to Nakamura, he was awarded this prize for how much Blue L.E.D. has contributed to sustainability and new areas. ""L.E.D. has already contributed a lot to the energy consumptions. It is a large surprise for us,""ù Nakamura said. Nakamura has devoted himself to research in the development of Gallium Nitride (GaN), thin film technology and Blue L.E.D. technology for more than 20 years.
However, he and his team are not content with the status quo. His focus point has transferred from L.E.D. lighting to laser lighting. According to Nakamura, laser lighting is a huge lighting technology and he and his team recently made a significant technological breakthrough in this area. Nakamura believes Blue L.E.D. has already contributed substantially in sustainability and renewable energy, and it now has a very broad market application prospective. / Courtesy of Wiki Commons Laser lighting is the same size as CHIF (Chanel Interface), but its current density is 1000 times higher than blue L.E.D. lighting. This means that by using tiny CHIF of laser lighting, we can make much brighter light. While recalling memories of developing Blue L.E.D. in Japan, Nakamura did not think it was an unforgettable or tough period at all. Instead he mentioned that the period of developing FASTON products was a complicated time, a wasted memory, but he thinks the process of inventing the Blue L.E.D. series or other products like Infrared and Red L.E.D. was similar and relatively easier to realize. Spanning more than 20 years of Nakamura's research experiences, there were many challenges, opportunities and obstacles on his way to success, and also a large part of time where he did research alone. In retrospect of how he created and started his research career, he evaluated it as ""a process from nothing to everything.""ù ""I love doing research because research is just like solving mysterious puzzles. Every time we did the experiment and got some data, I love to think and analyze about [this] data and how did [this] data come out,""ù Nakamura said. ""Even though sometimes I was stuck on some problems for quite a long time, I still love the feeling of solving problems and solved it out in the end. I had to develop many products when I worked for the Japanese company, but it is still normal for people to take three to four years to invent something and [make] it to products.""ù Although Nakamura may have already achieved many accomplishments and earned a nice reputation, he is still working enthusiastically with his 10 Ph.D. students on many projects and leading them on their way to success. He expresses great concern and confidence toward the youth and research. ""I am still ambitious and willing to do research with young students, and I love to recruit young students; young students are always very creative and bright. Even I obeyed the order as a student, but I was still very creative at [a] young age,""ù Nakamura said. ""The students are young, that is the most important thing. Basically, students proposed a lot ideas and advices during the research. They enjoy the research and freedom, and also they are very smart. They can do what they want and get the patent.""ù There are a lot of people today who are very aspirant and ambitious who want to achieve their purpose, especially in the science research area. Nakamura offered them valuable advice. ""Basically, it is now study time for young students, like reading papers and doing [research]. After studying a lot, you should try to challenge new [things], which means the research. But the new challenge means also you have to pick a new path, which means many people go in this way, then you have go to the totally different way alone and take the risk,""ù he said. ""You need to study a lot and fast because knowledge is the base of your research. Without knowledge you cannot do anything, and if you want to earn yourself a reputation, you need to take the risk.""ù Talking about the future prospect of L.E.D. technology, although the market competition is very severe and fierce, Nakamura is optimistic. He believes Blue L.E.D. has already contributed substantially in the sustainability and renewable energy, and it now has a very broad market application prospective. Also, the micro L.E.D. will be created soon. His team's focus on the laser lighting project will also be paid off soon because laser lighting will increase the power of lighting. All in all, it is predictable that Nakamura and his team will continue to scale a higher new height in the future.

science,"Elevated Levels of Potassium, Other Metals Found in Ash From Thomas Fire",8-Feb-18,12:30 AM,['Mika Kaczmar'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/elevated-levels-of-potassium-other-metals-found-in-ash-from-thomas-fire/,"Part of the ash left over from the Thomas Fire contains unexpectedly high levels of potassium and other metals, UC Santa Barbara researchers concluded. Following the Thomas Fire and the Montecito mudslides, researchers from the UCSB Bren School for Environmental Science and Management tested the concentrations of various elements to determine if the remaining ash was a concern to people in Santa Barbara County. Samples of ash were collected from 18 locations across Santa Barbara, Santa Paula and Goleta to test the concentration of various elements. Approximately 20 percent of the ash was a mixture of heavy and light metals such as calcium, aluminum, potassium, iron, magnesium, sodium and phosphorus, according to their tests. Ash from the Thomas Fire accumulates on a past issue of the newspaper. William Tracy / Daily Nexus According to UCSB Environmental Science and Management Professor Arturo Keller, these levels were ""higher than usual.""ù Keller, along with scientist Anastasiia Minakova, postdoctoral student Yuxiong Huang and graduate student Qian Gao, used a chemical analyzing instrument to determine the concentration of elements in the soil by parts per trillion. The researchers then compared the result to the level of toxicity of the various elements in the soil. Potassium, a nutrient present in vegetation, was found to have an above average level of toxicity. This could be due to the burning of greenery during the Thomas Fire, according to Keller. Although levels of potassium and other metals are higher than expected, it is not cause for worry, Keller noted. ""I don't think we will see those becoming a major problem.""ù Keller said. ""I think they are more of a concern in terms of inhaling the ash at that point than now on the soils.""ù However, there is still some concern about UCSB students and others breathing in the remaining ash. Keller advised anyone in areas affected by the Thomas Fire to clean up any remaining ash, as there is a risk of ash exposure leading to inhalation. The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department also showed some concern for the remaining contaminants from both the Thomas Fire and the mudslides. ""Using leaf blowers stirs up ash and dust,""ù the department said in a Feb. 2 press release. ""Ash and dust are larger particles, but over time, they break down into smaller, more harmful particles that can lodge deep into the lungs and cause serious health effects.""ù The drying mud from the mudslides in Montecito is also problematic because of the contaminants that may be concentrated within. Contaminants can range from gasoline to sewage, since these products were picked up by a rapidly moving mixture of water and earthy material, KPCC reported. This can be concerning to residents of Santa Barbara, where these particles can be transmitted and inhaled, causing adverse health effects. As particles continue to surface due to the drying mud, the Air Pollution Control District (APCD) has administered portable monitoring devices to read fine particulate matter in the air in Montecito. Permanent monitoring stations for PM 2.5 are located in Santa Barbara, Goleta, Lompoc, and Santa Maira. Stations for PM 10 are located in Santa Barbara, Goleta, Santa Maria, Lompoc, El Capitan, Las Flores Canyon and Vandenberg Air Force Base. These devices make it easier for those affected to judge the pollution concentration in the air and make smarter decisions about the time they spend outdoors. Goleta is measured to be between 0-50 PM 2.5, which means the area's air quality is ""good,""ù according to the APCD. ""Fire [has] this property of redistributing nutrients in our ecosystem. There were other metals, not very much, that we don't like to have,""ù Keller said. ""What we don't want is for them to increase in our soils.""ù Correction: The story has been updated to include a list of PM stations.†

science,UCSB Researchers Repair the Riparian Forests,8-Feb-18,12:42 AM,['Aimee Miller'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/ucsb-researchers-repair-the-riparian-forests/,"Riparian forests are ecosystems that are rich in life and biodiversity, providing a critical habitat for a range of organisms spanning from understory and brush to amphibians and mammals. However, climate change threatens the functionality of these environments, as less rainfall and warming atmospheric conditions endanger the life of the trees and consequently, the numerous species that rely on them. In order to analyze and impede the decline of these fundamental forests, a team of scientists from UCSB and the State University of New York is conducting a series of projects to study how riparian forests located in drought-prone environments are responding to climate change. With the support of $2.5 million in combined funding, three discrete grants are transpiring in hopes of monitoring these essential habitats and discovering relevant management solutions. The three projects are focusing particularly on riparian forests in drought-prone environments because of the additional strains of heat and dryness in those areas. While local climatic factors act as a source of stress for many organisms, the riparian corridor ""î the ribbon of trees along the river channel ""î provides a shady, cool and water-filled place for many species to congregate, resulting in a type of oasis for a wide range of species. One of the scientists collaborating on all three projects, Michael Singer from UCSB's Earth Research Institute (ERI), highlights that these benefits to the broader ecosystem are only provided by the forests if the water in those areas is readily available and the trees remain healthy, factors which are typically influenced by climate change. ""With less rain falling and therefore less water being infiltrated into the soil, there is reduced water availability to the trees. Additionally, under warming atmospheric conditions, the water that arrives at the surface will evaporate at higher rates,""ù Singer said. ""If the environment starts drying up or the water source to the particular tree species begins to disappear, then the trees start to suffer, dropping branches and leaves and ceasing photosynthesis.""ù The Santa Clara basin, because it goes dry, relies largely on subsurface groundwater. Continual pumping of groundwater from the aquifer for agriculture, when that aquifer is not recharged by rainfall, causes wells to go dry and forces pumping efforts to reach deeper and deeper. / Courtesy of John Stella The first of the three projects focuses on the Santa Clara River Valley, which is a multiple-use basin with conflicting interests between ecological, agricultural and urban uses. Funded by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Geography and Spatial Sciences Program, the grant concentrates on groundwater-dependent areas, where trees that are more deeply rooted rely on a deeper groundwater source. Singer and his colleagues, UCSB geography professor Dar Roberts and associate professor from the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, John Stella, are utilizing a variety of water stress indicators in order to determine how the trees are performing with respect to the water table elevations and trends through time. These indicators include remote sensing metrics, which utilize space satellites to reveal greenness index changes, inventories of forest health via ground perspective, and isotope analysis, which involves extracting cellulose from each ring in a tree core to determine what water source was used by the tree in each year of growth. In combination, these water stress indicators will help the scientists establish groundwater depletion trends, which heavily influence the success of these riparian forests. The second project, supported by the NSF Hydrologic Sciences Program, focuses on the Rh√¥ne River in southern France. This river extends through Europe and has a powerful climate gradient ranging from wet and cool to hot and dry. The Rh√¥ne River in southern France. /Courtesy of John Stella Singer, Stella and ERI director and UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management professor Kelly Caylor are utilizing isotope analysis to determine water use of two different species of trees in the riparian forest in France. Specifically, they are using carbon isotopes to reveal the health of the tree and sap-flux measurements to indicate tree water uptake. The project also involves mathematical modeling to project 50 years into the future and predict what might happen to the forests along the climate gradient. The final project is funded by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and is focused on identifying various management solutions for riparian forest ecosystems in DoD areas. ""The DoD has bases located all over the U.S. and abroad, and those bases tend to be hotspots for biodiversity because most of the area is not being used for training and gunneries. It's just wild land that acts like a buffer, and since that land is not under any development pressure, it has attracted a lot of endangered species,""ù Singer said. ""Because of the Endangered Species Act, those species and their habitats need to be protected. So increasingly, the DoD is spending money on the conservation of these species, and our project is meant to try to come up with different management solutions that could minimize that expenditure.""ù In this project, Singer, Roberts, Caylor and Stella are utilizing water stress indicators such as isotopic information from the tree rings, remote sensing and some numerical modeling of water fluxes and climate change to explore how to arrive at effective management solutions. The primary goal of the cumulative projects is to understand the scientific systems underlying riparian forests and their response to climate change; however, the researchers would like to focus on the management context as well. ""All these projects were written with some sort of management involvement to help benefit the managing of water, resources and forests,""ù Singer said. ""The core of it is science, but ultimately if we could provide some tools for management, then that's a net benefit as well.""ù

In addition to strong female figures, her father is a pioneer in solar energy, as he designed Japan's first solar house where Kimura grew up. Kimura gave anecdotes about how her parents met, how she met her husband and her move from New York to Irvine. While she is successful in her field, she speaks about the sexism her mother faced in Japan and the sexism she faced in the U.S. ""My mom went back to Japan with my dad when she was eight months pregnant with me. She was the only female law student. Then her adviser comes from the other corridor and he says, ""òOh, Mrs. Kimura, there's a job opening next month,' and then she says ""òI'm having a baby next month.' That was the last job offer she got in three years,""ù Kimura said. All these stories and experiences she spoke about were to support her message. ""If you want to advance or if you want to say something about women in academia, give her some help,""ù Kimura said. In this instance, Kimura was speaking about her children and the problems other faculty with young children face. Many of the guest speakers got to where they are now because of the help they received from people who supported them. This idea of helping one another was also seen in Kathy Rae Huffman's talk. Huffman is an independent curator, currently based between Berlin and Los Angeles. She is also the co-founder of F.A.C.E.S., an international online community for women in media arts. F.A.C.E.S. was founded after Huffman and her female colleagues in European media arts wanted to answer the question, ""Where are the women?""ù Its purpose is to bring women together in order to form a network among them. In addition to talking about why it is important to help one another, other guest speakers spoke about how that network could benefit bigger issues, such as climate change. Victoria Vesna, an artist and professor at the UCLA department of Design Media Arts and the director of the ArtSci Center at the School of the Arts and California Nanosystems Institute (CNSI), spoke about an exhibition she co-curated that challenged reductive, binary mindsets and aimed to foster artistic interventions on feminist and ecological activism. According the Vesna, even environmentalists who generally refer to non-human nature as the environment, the natural resources for human use and often still hinge on the anthropocentric view are confused with ecologists who see the Gaia. It is known that hundreds of species of life are disappearing, deforestation is worldwide and increasing global pollution is exacerbated by the rampant consumerism, says Vesna. Denigration of women, people of color, women and animals is connected to the basic dualism of Western culture. The conference concluded with another keynote speaker, Joan La Barbara, followed by her performance. It is clear that female artists and technologists are navigating their way through the endless possibilities of the integration of science, technology and digital media, leaving their own mark in an ever-expanding creative and science field.

science,UCSB Selected to Host Its First SASE Conference,15-Feb-18,12:39 AM,['Kevin Flores'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-selected-to-host-its-first-sase-conference/,"Three years after its founding in the fall of 2015, the UCSB Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) chapter was selected to host the organization's West Regional Conference for the first time. Bringing together students from around the region as well as professionals, recruiters and representatives from various companies and schools, the conference strives to provide its members with opportunities to network and to grow within their Asian American identity. The organization's selection of UC Santa Barbara to host the 2018 conference marks the first time the chapter has been selected, a hallmark event in its brief but impactful history, but also a chance to display the various resources and amenities the UCSB campus has to offer. SASE is an organization whose mission is to bolster the Asian and Asian American identity in the S.T.E.M. fields, whether that be on a university campus or in the workplace. Additionally, its members strive to both celebrate and promote diversity in all forms. Boasting a roster of more than 50 active members, the UCSB chapter has effectively solidified its place among other universities' chapters. The conference serves as a place for young Asian and Asian American scientists and engineers to explore professional and networking opportunities outside of academia. For many members, the conference marks their first foray into the perhaps daunting world of industry. ""I feel like this is my first step into the professional world. I'd never attended anything where I had to wear a suit or dress formally,""ù second-year biology major Alicia Leung said. ""I wanted to see how people presented themselves in these situations, especially people around my age.""ù For a large majority of the members, the club provides a comfortable intersectionality between their major of choice and their cultural background. SASE is an organization whose mission is to bolster the Asian and Asian American identity in the S.T.E.M. fields, whether that be on a university campus or in the workplace. Additionally, its members strive to both celebrate and promote diversity in all forms. With over 50 active members, the UCSB chapter has solidified its place. / Courtesy of SASE ""One of the main things I wanted to do when I came to this school was to find some kind of extracurricular activity that related to my culture. But I also wanted to find an academic club,""ù Leung said. ""When I heard about SASE, I thought it was a perfect fit. A good mesh between the academic and the social aspect.""ù The theme for this year's conference was ""Empower You to Act,""ù wherein conference goers were encouraged to break stereotypes and expectations commonly placed on Asians and Asian Americans. Through a number of different workshops and keynote speakers, the club's leadership aimed to motivate its members to take initiative in finding professional and academic opportunities. ""There's a stereotype of Asian Americans as a model minority and SASE aims to break that,""ù Shreyas Radhakrishna, a fourth-year computer science major and one of the co-presidents of the UCSB SASE chapter, said. ""One of our goals is to help our members be more outspoken, to be able to stand up for themselves, to step up where it's necessary and to be able to step out of their comfort zone and act on opportunities they may be tempted to pass by.""ù Moreover, both the club and the conference provide an opportunity for students to comfortably navigate the professional sphere, while immersed in an environment that is keen on embracing their cultural identities. ""I feel like being around like-minded, very ambitious individuals is very inspiring. Surrounding myself with professional, ambitious people has helped me become more ambitious,""ù Leung said. ""[SASE] has helped me be more in touch with my roots. Being around other [Asian Americans], I never have to suppress anything I may have been conscious about before; I'm around people who practically grew up in the same culture.""ù For its younger members, the conference provides a chance to experience first-hand the work that goes into putting on such a large event. ""It's nice to see how a conference like this is set up,""ù Alex Hattori, first-year chemical engineering major, said. ""I've never done anything like this, where lots of companies come and you can meet a lot of students.""ù ""The club has really helped me,""ù Karen Caballero-Austria, first-year physics major, said. ""Academically, for example, they bring a lot of people from certain research companies to talk about how to get internships, explore research opportunities and go over resumes. Learning about the companies and what they do and seeing what I can do to improve before the next conference.""ù As these young students only tentatively begin to get a feel for what the world is like post-graduation, the conference provides an incomparable learning experience. With so many large companies like the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Northrop Grumman in attendance, there is a high chance that they might just find something they are truly interested in pursuing. ""For a freshman who's not really used to taking initiative, it was my first time getting involved in these sorts of [professional] events, watching how people interacted,""ù first-year biology major Se Hyeon Park said. ""I wanted more exposure to these kinds of events, to learn about these companies and what they do.""ù Overall, the SASE conference and the UCSB SASE chapter provide an unrivaled resource for students looking to embrace the intersectionality of being an Asian American in the S.T.E.M. fields. By providing invaluable networking and research opportunities, they aim to prepare their members for success in the world outside of university.

science,Arginine‚'s Larger (in) Life Role,22-Feb-18,12:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/arginines-larger-in-life-role/,"Scientists studying the origins of life investigate the condition and process by which organic molecules, such as proteins, came to occur. One popular hypothesis for the origin of life is the RNA World Hypothesis, describing a prebiotic (""before life""ù) stage in which RNA-based life forms are believed to have existed before DNA-based organisms. RNA is vital to the production of amino acids, which create chains to form proteins necessary for structure, function and regulation of body tissues. Recently, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have discovered that the amino acids arginine and, to a lesser degree, lysine may have greater importance than previously thought regarding the origin of life. Technically, it isn't the arginine as we know it today, but rather its prebiotic equivalent containing the same properties. ""We're very careful in that we don't say arginine is biologically plausible; we say that something with the same biophysical properties that arginine has will have been necessary in this prebiotic state,""ù Celia Blanco, postdoctoral researcher in the Chen lab and lead author of a paper in the journal Current Biology, said. ""Some people have said that arginine hasn't played a significant role because when deciding what we think would have been prebiotically available or what we think could happen during a prebiotic state, for years, the criteria we use for such experimentation were mainly determined by which amino acids we can synthesize in the laboratory. And arginine and lysine are very difficult to produce or synthesize,""ù Blanco said. Another widely used criterion lies in inspecting the composition of meteorites and deep-sea hydrothermal vents, other highly explored sources for the origin of life. Arginine and lysine have not been found in meteorites, leading scientists to hypothesize that these amino acids would have occurred later in the stages of life. The researchers point out that billions of years ago the biomolecule may not have been arginine but perhaps a primordial equivalent./Courtesy of Wiki Commons Interestingly, when the UCSB researchers began their examination of possible prebiotic scenarios, they weren't focused on arginine or other specific amino acids, but rather on their properties. ""Because we know that the role of proteins is to interact with RNA, an important property for proteins in a prebiotic world would be the ability to interact with RNA,""ù Blanco said. ""So we thought that if we could figure out which properties of a protein favor RNA binding, we could fill in which properties primordial proteins will have had in order to start performing those reactions with RNA.""ù Although they didn't have preconceived ideas about the amino acids when they started, Blanco said, because arginine and lysine are positively charged molecules, the researchers did suspect they could be relevant for binding to RNA, which has a negatively charged backbone. ""We think that the property that is essential for all this is the charge. We think that because arginine is positively charged, it makes it essential to RNA binding.""ù In their research, rather than looking at complexes formed by proteins and natural biological RNA, the scientists used complexes formed by proteins and aptamers (short stretches of RNA or DNA apt to bind to specific target molecules). As biological complexes have been subjected to many years of evolution, they perform tasks other than binding protein, which could have led to confounding factors. Using aptamers removed these confounding factors created by evolutionary pressures, allowing the researchers to draw conclusions on what is necessary for binding. ""We wanted to use these aptamer complexes because they have been developed in vitro, meaning they've been selected to bind to the proteins and not for anything else,""ù Blanco said. The scientists then collected these protein-aptamer complexes and analyzed their interphase, leading them to discover the over-representation of positively charged amino acids, with arginine dominantly present. ""The most relevant conclusion we can form from all this is that looking at these properties is changing the idea we have of what could be prebiotically available and prebiotically plausible, and not necessarily just seen in experiments. The fact that we don't observe something nowadays doesn't mean it wasn't there back in the day,""ù Blanco said.
Print There appears to be some interesting science here, but failed to read anything that could possibly be relevant to the origin of life. Chemical evolution is a myth, like Darwin's ""warm little ponds""ù and Oparin-Haldane prebiotic soup. Lysine and Arginine have not been found in homochiral states naturally, so while hypothetically and experimentally they may be considered of some significance to organic systems outside the context of cellular functions, there is nothing here to mitigate the intractable issues of the failure of naturalistic models for the origin of life.

They provide food and shelter to thousands of fish, invertebrates and other algae. Studying the kelp forest is a valuable method for understanding many ecological processes. To draw attention to the critical role the giant kelp plays both within and outside of the ocean, UC Santa Barbara marine biologists Carol Blanchette and Jenny Dugan wrote The Golden Forest, a children's book which explores kelp forest ecology and biodiversity. The book was inspired by the Long Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) at UCSB which was established by the National Science Foundation to promote research on long-term ecological phenomena. ""It's good for people to understand the world around them and know the important role kelp plays in the functioning of the ecosystem,""ù Blanchette said on the key aim of the book. ""That kelp which washes up on the beach is not garbage, but an important food source for organisms and is used as a way of recycling nutrients and carbon along the coast.""ù The book unites existing study modules about kelp forests and the sandy beach to explore the idea of connections across ecosystems. MSI is developing additional curriculum based on the book./Courtesy of ucnrs.org The story follows Owen, a young boy who travels from Colorado to coastal California to visit his cousin and aunt. With his family, he explores the beach and studies the vast array of life which depend on kelp and other ocean plants. Throughout his educational journey, he learns of the importance of kelp both in the water and along the coast. Just as the giant kelp provides food and protection to fish communities and marine mammal species underwater, so too does the kelp offer sustenance for invertebrates and bird species on the shore. Some bird species directly depend on the densities of larvae and invertebrates which inhabit the kelp. Through the Santa Barbara Coastal's Schoolyard LTER program, K-12 students are able to read the book before visiting UCSB. Blanchette explains that the book allows the youth to have a fundamental level of understanding of coastal ecology before they explore the beach and UCSB's Research Experience & Education Facility (R.E.E.F.). ""With this background knowledge, they can really appreciate the kind of activities they do and what they observe,""ù Blanchette said While the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER continues to study the significance of land and ocean processes in structuring kelp forest ecosystems, there is a shifting focus of research for both Blanchette and the program. ""A lot of the upcoming research areas for the LTER are going to be investigating more about how coastal climates are changing and trying to understand what the future holds for environmental variables.""ù † Comments are closed.

science,UCSB Researchers Survey Debris Flows After Montecito Mudslides,22-Feb-18,12:39 AM,['Kirstie Allen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/ucsb-researchers-survey-debris-flows-after-montecito-mudslides/,"In the early hours of Jan. 9, an enormous amount of rainfall fell on Montecito. The foothills scorched by the Thomas Fire could not absorb all the water, creating a force of mud, debris, sediment, rocks and plants that pushed its way through the Montecito communities toward the Pacific Ocean. The path of mud led to damaged homes, closure of the 101 freeway and loss of loved ones. Following this natural disaster, UCSB Earth Science professor Ed Keller held a talk about this event in Santa Barbara's Faulkner Gallery. On Jan. 25, Professor Keller discussed the causes and effects of this mudslide. The Santa Barbara area is particularly vulnerable to debris flows. The huge debris flow was brought on by the severe rainfall following the Thomas Fire. These types of natural events, such as fires and floods, occur cyclically, but can occasionally sync up, adding to the effects that have accumulated over the years. The synergy of the natural disasters creates a force that fills streams, destroys everything in its wake and prevents debris basins from its job. Due the storm earlier this year, large boulders were carried into the streets of residential areas and buildings in Montecito. These boulders made a devastating impact. Before Jan. 9, the boulders were stationary in creek beds. However, silt carried by the water from the rainfall forced the boulders out of place. Silt is fine sand carried by the flow of water, which then deposits as sediment. The U.S. 101 Highway was closed early January as mudslides and flooding made driving nearly impossible in locations such as the Olive Mill Road overpass. Currently, researchers are keeping an eye on Montecito./ Courtesy of Mike Eliason The Thomas Fire had destroyed the hillside, making sediment loose due to the lack of roots holding the landscape in place. The combination of loose sediment and rainfall moved the boulders. Another contributor is the presence of a certain type of soil that absorbs water. This soil is usually common after wildfires, and it helped to speed up the flow of the sediment-rich water. The density of the sediment flow was 120 pounds per cubic foot and the boulders were 150 pounds per cubic foot. Dr. Keller and fellow researchers surveyed the sites of the disaster in Montecito. If there is another storm, they hope to understand and predict the appearance of more boulders. Since the debris flow was more than they predicted, researchers hope to find an answer as to why. An event like this is very uncommon; therefore, it can be difficult to prepare for situations such as the one right here in Montecito. People who lived in the area almost 100 years ago typically avoided living near creeks, but the homes that were lost in the flood are built very close. Currently, researchers are keeping an eye on Montecito and involving themselves in community outreach in those affected areas. Until the trees and plants grow back on the hillside, the soil will remain variable to its environment. † Comments are closed.

science,Climate Change One Step At a Time,1-Mar-18,1:05 AM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/climate-change-one-step-at-a-time/,"Despite the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation, an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance set to start in the year 2020, makes it seem as though President Trump's decision has not hindered the carbon neutrality movement. An example of the determination in reducing our carbon footprint can be seen right on our campus. A 27-member team composed of researchers, facilities managers and students from across the UC campuses, including UC Santa Barbara, have released a report that presents a feasible strategy to help achieve carbon neutrality by replacing natural gas with more climate-friendly options. The University of California launched its Carbon Neutrality Initiative in 2013, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2025. However, how the UC system will hit its target is uncertain. For now, the UC carbon neutrality pledge applies to direct emissions from UC-owned infrastructure and indirect emissions associated with the purchase of electric power. Indirect emissions from employee-owned vehicles, off-campus computing, air travel and those embodied in consumer goods and services are subject to long-term goals but actionable plans will require more leadership. Graph A shows natural gas burned on UC campuses accounted for 63 percent of the university's CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, including both direct emissions and indirect emissions related to purchased electricity and steam. Graph B shows the magnitude and share relative to each campus of natural gas emissions varies across the 10 UC campuses according to their size and climate, with all five of the largest campuses having medical centers. / Courtesy of nature.com As the UC is focusing on its own emissions, gas is central. It accounts for 96 percent of emissions. About half the UC campuses have gas-fired power plants and combined heat and power systems that save money through self-generation of energy services. The other half of the campuses are typically smaller, and most of their emissions come from purchased electricity. In California, essentially all carbon emissions from the electrical grid come from burning natural gas, which accounts for 60 percent of the state's power generation; the rest of the grid is operationally emissions-free. In California, and increasingly in the broader US power sector, decarbonizing electricity is about natural gas.
The report's three-step plan to reduce the UC's consumption of natural gas entails aggressively increasing energy efficiency across all 10 campuses and five medical centers and in the short term replacing natural gas with biogas. In the long term, the goal is to electrify all end uses of energy and switch to only renewable sources. ""Economically, energy efficiency is a no-brainer,""ù David Auston, director of the TomKat Foundation-funded project, a researcher at UCSB's Institute for Energy Efficiency (IEE) and a senior fellow at the campus's National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), said. ""Not only is it wise to do it because it saves money, but those funds can be used to make investments in other things like electrification and biogas.""ù The graph above shows the UCs' recent rate of progress toward eliminating carbon from operations since 2009. Progress in bending the curve downward is anticipated from 2016 to 2018 based on solar PV coming on-line and biogas development. / Courtesy of nature.com The first step in the report is to reduce energy use by retrofitting existing buildings and designing new buildings to be highly efficient and all-electric rather than reliant on gas-fueled systems. According to the report, well-planned energy efficiency investments pay for themselves through avoided energy costs. By the researchers' estimates, additional retro-fits could cut UC electricity use by 38 percent, and natural gas by 29 percent. The second step is to replace conventional natural gas with less emission-intensive alternative fuels that would allow continued use of gas infrastructures. For now, most eyes are on biogenic methane (biogas), produced today mainly by anaerobic decomposition of organic materials such as manure, food waste, agricultural wastes, fermentable landfill materials and biosolids from wastewater treatment plants. The UC system already buys some biogas. For example, UC San Diego purchases biogas credits from a sewage treatment plant on Point Loma, about 15 km away, while burning conventional gas to power a fuel cell. ""We view biogas as an interim measure that buys us more time,""ù Auston said. ""Ultimately, it must be phased out and replaced by 100 percent electrification.""ù The last step is electrification. The UC system is procuring more zero-emission electricity, a practice that is typically implemented by purchasing wind and solar energy. UC's campuses now include more than 50 megawatts of on-campus renewable electricity generation and 80 megawatts of utility-scale solar generation from sites in remote Fresno County. Buying zero-emissions electricity to supply existing power loads is relatively straightforward and does not raise many organizational or financial barriers. Independent from the UC's Carbon Neutrality Initiative, the report and paper are part of the larger TomKat Carbon Neutrality Project to identify practical, bottom-up strategies for meeting the 2025 deadline. This effort was funded by the TomKat Foundation and the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and co-led by UCSB's NCEAS and the IEE. Additional financial support for the report came from the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute. After years of global talking without much action on climate change, the good news in Paris is that there is now a framework for leaders and followers alike to get serious about deep cuts in emissions.

science,Grey Sharks‚' Unusual Contribution to Reef Environments,6-Apr-18,7:27 PM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-06/grey-sharks-unusual-contribution-to-reef-environments/,"The balance in any ecosystem comes from the organisms inhabiting that community, and the Palmyra Atoll is no different. A study led by scientists from Imperial College London in collaboration with marine biologists from UC Santa Barbara found that predators, through their fecal material, transfer vital nutrients from their open ocean feeding grounds into shallower reef environments, contributing to the overall health of ecosystems. The researchers specifically examined the role of grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, a predatory species commonly associated with coral environments but whose wider ecological role has long been debated. ""Our study shows that large mobile predators such as sharks may be a very important source of nutrients for even the smallest reef creatures, such as corals,""ù co-author Jennifer Caselle, a research biologist at UCSB's Marine Science Institute, said. ""The role of sharks as top predators is well understood, but their role as nutrient vectors is far less studied.""ù The study extends the understanding of grey reef sharks' movements across various reef systems which is crucial for the developing effective conservation approaches and species vulnerability assessments. / Courtesy of wiki commons Palmyra Atoll is a remote, relatively undisturbed coral reef ecosystem, and is part of a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge within the central Pacific Ocean. Because of its protected status, Palmyra has a healthy predator population, with grey reef sharks being the most abundant predator on the fore-reefs. The grey reef shark population at Palmyra is probably at carrying capacity and may play a significant role in the transportation and flow of nutrients onto the reef and throughout the atoll. Grey reef sharks are often detected on and suggested to favor outer-reef slopes and drop-off habitats but on occasion are detected within lagoons. Isotope analyses at Palmyra have demonstrated that grey reef sharks acquire resources from different habitats, including from pelagic and near-shore environments. However, the use of these habitats for foraging is uneven, with around 86 percent of grey reef shark biomass being derived from pelagic resources. Mobile species that transport nutrients between habitats have the potential to impact new primary productivity and contribute to the modification of the physical environment. How mobile marine predators such as sharks facilitate this nutrient transport, how much they contribute and how this is subsequently distributed across shallow, productive reef habitats remains unexplored. The researchers analyzed tracking data as a spatial network of movements and were able, for the first time, to estimate the quantities of nitrogen deposited around the remote unfished reef of Palmyra Atoll via the sharks' fecal material. Results estimate that this specific population of grey reef sharks, believed to number approximately 8,300 individual animals, contributes a combined total of 94.5 kg or 208.3 pounds of nitrogen to the reef ecosystem per day, an amount that likely contributes substantially to reef primary productivity. These research findings have implications for the scientific understanding of fragile coral reef ecosystems as well as for the ecological significance of grey reef sharks. The species is currently classified as ""near threatened""ù on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List. ""Coupled with their better-known role as predators, our study underlines another, less obvious role played by reef sharks in improving the resilience of these fragile habitats and underscores the vital importance of conserving these and other wide-ranging predators,""ù senior co-author David Jacoby of the Zoological Society of London's Institute of Zoology said.

science,Sounds of Eruptions Used to Describe Volcanoes,6-Apr-18,7:37 PM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-06/sounds-of-eruptions-used-to-describe-volcanoes/,"A new case study done by a team of international scientists led by UC Santa Barbara geophysicist Robin Matoza examined data from the 2015 eruption of the Calbuco volcano in Chile using a network from the United Nations' International Monitoring System (IMS), to track volcanic eruptions in remote locations. The researchers chose this event because they could compare long-range data with local readings, enabling study of the large volcanic explosion using infrasound sensors. As part of the United Nations' Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty, an IMS was built to detect any nuclear explosion on Earth, including underground, underwater or in the atmosphere. The system is a network to detect atmospheric infrasound, sound waves with frequencies below the lower limit of human audibility. Calbuco volcano in Chile erupted April 2015 in two sub-plinian phases. Plinian eruptions are volcanic eruptions marked by their similarity to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. This was Calbuco's first activity since 1972. Courtesy of wiki commons ""We want to be able to monitor regions in the world where many volcanoes do not have local monitoring stations like Calbuco does,""ù Matoza, an assistant professor in UCSB's Department of Earth Science, said. ""In some places ""î for example, the Aleutian Islands in Alaska ""î it's challenging to maintain observation networks on the volcanoes themselves due to harsh weather and their remote locations. Consequently, many Aleutian volcanoes are not instrumented. We want to be able to detect, locate and characterize remote explosive volcanic activity because eruptions can release ash clouds into the atmosphere, which are hazardous to aircraft.""ù The well-documented April 2015 eruption of Calbuco represented a unique opportunity to test and evaluate remote infrasonic detection, location and characterization capabilities. The researchers evaluated the ability of remote IMS infrasound stations to detect volcanic eruption signals in the presence of wind noise and interfering infrasound signals, provide fast and reliable location solutions using automated procedures and provide constraints on the timing of explosive eruptive activity. Previous work has demonstrated that remote infrasound arrays can be used to detect, locate and provide detailed chronologies of remote explosive volcanism, with the potential to provide source parameters for ash transport and dispersal models. ""What's nice about infrasound is that we are able to gather information farther from the source than with traditional ground-based monitoring methods. Typically, seismic signals from eruptions don't propagate more than a few hundred kilometers from the source,""ù Matoza said. ""With Calbuco, for example, you can see the eruption very clearly on the local monitoring stations and out to about 250 kilometers on regional seismic networks, but with infrasound, the signal propagates in the atmosphere for more than 5,000 kilometers. What's more, infrasound delivers different information than seismic data alone.""ù The April 2015 Calbuco eruption was a useful case study to test and validate remote infrasound signal association and source location methodologies using the IMS network. The researchers applied Matoza's method to detect and locate the eruption signals using a brute-force, grid-search cross-bearings approach. The method involves determining location trajectories from multiple arrays that intersect. ""One of the recommendations from this study is that more seismic networks should also have infrasound sensors,""ù Matoza said. ""It's one extra channel of data to record that provides very useful information for improving volcano monitoring.""ù The remote IMS infrasound arrays provide an accurate explosion chronology consistent with the regional and local seismo-acoustic data, increasing confidence in the use of remote infrasound observations for automated detection, location and characterization of explosive volcanism. Augmenting the IMS in regions of dense volcanism, even with relatively sparse regional seismo-acoustic networks, will dramatically enhance volcanic signal detection, reduce latency and improve discrimination capability.

science,UCSB Researchers Advance Coral Restoration,11-Apr-18,8:52 PM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-11/ucsb-researchers-advance-coral-restoration/,"Corals are in rapid decline on many reefs due to global stressors associated with climate change, such as increasing sea surface temperatures that cause coral bleaching and disease, as well as local stressors like nutrient pollution, sedimentation and overfishing. As coral reefs decline globally, incorporating ecological processes into restoration planning is increasingly recognized as a fundamental component of successful restoration strategies. An important component to restoration of degraded terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems is the reestablishment of key ecological processes UC Santa Barbara scientists and their colleagues advocate for harnessing ecological processes that drive community dynamics on coral reefs in a way that facilitates the establishment and growth of restored corals. Using existing scientific literature coupled with original research, they outline a scientific framework aimed at advancing the emerging field of coral restoration. Ultimately, they argue that coral restoration should explicitly incorporate key natural processes to exploit dynamic ecological forces and drive recovery of coral reef ecosystems. ""We don't have a lot of science to guide how we actually conduct coral restoration,""ù co-author Deron Burkepile, an associate professor in UCSB's Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB) said. ""The next phase of coral restoration must focus on harnessing ecological processes that drive community dynamics on coral reefs to help facilitate the establishment and growth of restored corals.""ù Current restoration efforts largely focus on outplanting, or transplanting, corals raised in nurseries to augment existing populations, with the goal of restoring key foundational species on degraded reefs. These efforts have become increasingly successful at establishing target corals that are often threatened or endangered. In the Caribbean alone, there are at present more than 150 coral propagation operations in over 20 countries, containing tens of thousands of nursery""êraised corals for use in restoration efforts. The nascent field of coral restoration is therefore on the threshold of conducting substantial restoration programs. The researchers examined five critical ecological processes ""î herbivory, competition, predation, nutrient cycling and recruitment ""î that drive coral reef functions to determine how to maximize recovery of an endangered coral species, Acropora cervicornis. Also known as staghorn coral, this large fast-growing species is common in the Caribbean. In regards to herbivory, robust herbivore populations can suppress macroalgal cover, minimize coral-algal competition, increase coral growth and recruitment and facilitate the recovery of coral populations after disturbances. Due to this, the researchers believe that capitalizing on herbivory in concert with coral restoration, either by outplanting coral in areas where herbivory is high or promoting herbivory on reefs where it is diminished, should therefore be both a research and a restoration priority. While herbivory may help in terms of coral-algal competition, coral predation, or corallivory, is a chronic source of tissue loss and mortality for many species of coral. Common predators of coral include many types of invertebrates such as snails, fireworms and sea stars, and fishes like damselfishes, butterflyfishes and other corallivorous species. Before the mass bleaching of 2014, over 40 percent of the coral cover lost on Australia's Great Barrier Reef over the past three decades was due to outbreaks of the corallivorous crown""êof""êthorns sea star. However, through the researchers' survey, they found that avoiding or managing corallivory was seen as one of the least important factors among restoration practitioners when selecting sites to outplant corals. Despite this, corallivory has attracted more research attention in the coral restoration literature. Recovery of corals on a degraded reef can be facilitated by positive feedbacks. If restoration can promote these feedback mechanisms, the likelihood for coral recovery increases. Simultaneously, negative feedbacks also can inhibit recovery. However, restoration can be designed to impinge on these negative mechanisms to disrupt these feedbacks and initiate recovery required to push a reef from a degraded state toward recovery. / Courtesy of Ecological Society of America This surprising insight can be attributed to the fact that as coral cover declines, predation by roving corallivorous fishes can generate an alarming pattern in which predation intensity on corals increases as coral cover decreases. Additionally, corallivory from less mobile organisms also intensifies as coral cover decreases and food resources become scarcer. Given this relationship, sites featuring exceptionally low coral cover may in fact be poor choices for restoration. Processes that affect coral survival ""î and ultimately restoration efforts ""î may be context""êdependent. For example, many damselfishes are territorial algal gardeners that could promote or hinder restoration efforts, depending on geographic location and species""êspecific behavior. In the Caribbean, territorial damselfishes destroy large amounts of live coral tissue to create algal gardens that are fiercely protected from larger herbivores. Coral restoration efforts should therefore avoid areas with large damselfish populations. Concentrating coral outplants in areas with high biomass of piscivorous fishes may reduce the abundance of damselfishes and their negative impact on corals. Conversely, on Indo""êPacific reefs, territories of the dusky farmerfish, a common species of damselfish, can promote the survival and growth of rare corals that are otherwise rapidly consumed by corallivorous fishes. Structures created by living corals can aggregate fishes and concentrate fish""êderived nutrients that increase coral growth. These fish""êderived nutrient hotspots also increase grazing by herbivorous fishes and reduce algal abundance, both of which likely enhance coral growth and survivorship. Competition for limiting resources can drive population dynamics, community succession and ecosystem function, particularly on coral reefs, where space is a highly contested resource. On many reefs worldwide, weedy, fast""êgrowing species of sponges and soft corals are replacing reef""êbuilding corals and slowing the growth and survivorship of remaining corals. Frequent and abundant competitive interactions can generate a series of negative feedbacks that may inhibit the regeneration of diverse, topographically complex coral reefs and impede restoration efforts. Understanding competitive interactions among corals used for restoration and their benthic competitors could assist in restoration site selection, as practitioners are clearly interested in avoiding benthic competitors when outplanting corals. Corals vary widely in basic traits that influence population and community structures, such as growth rates, reproductive outputs and symbiont identities, which differ among species, populations and individuals within a population. For example, there is substantial variability among genotypes for such traits as growth and branching rates. For coral restoration, more information about important traits of corals used for restoration would allow restoration practitioners to select species and genotypes best suited for specific restoration sites. ""The future of coral restoration lies at the intersection of capitalizing on people's abilities to grow coral and combining that with accumulated ecological knowledge about how reefs actually work,""ù Burkepile said. ""Up until now, those two camps have been operating in separate spaces, so we need to put their Venn diagrams together to make their interests overlap because there's a lot of productive space in the middle.""ù

science,The Children Are Preparing for the Future,18-Apr-18,10:02 PM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-18/the-children-are-preparing-for-the-future/,"As climate change continues to alter ecosystems, many organisms have had to adapt in order to overcome fluctuations in their environment. It is important to understand the mechanisms in which organisms can respond to a rapidly changing ocean. It is an important research priority in marine sciences, especially in light of recent predictions regarding the pace of ocean change in the coming decades. A new study by UC Santa Barbara marine biologists demonstrates that for purple female sea urchins of the species Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, exposure to stressful climate conditions such as low pH levels often makes for hardier, larger offspring. ""We've known that these things go on in fish and other species, but we've never studied this in the context of climate change in the marine ecology of kelp forests,""ù co-author Gretchen Hofmann, chair of UCSB's department of ecology, evolution and marine biology, said. ""This project looked for evidence of rapid adaptation in organisms in response to a changing ocean, and we found it.""ù The mechanism observed was a transgenerational effect also known as transgenerational plasticity (TGP), in which the experience of the parental generation can shape the phenotype of their offspring. In the study, adult purple sea urchins were exposed to regionally and ecologically relevant carbon dioxide levels and temperatures representative of upwelling ""î colder temperature and high carbon dioxide ""î and non-upwelling ""î average temperature and low carbon dioxide conditions typical of coastal upwelling regions in the California Current System. The researchers took urchins from the Santa Barbara Channel and brought them into the lab. The animals were held for about four months while the females made ripe eggs, a process called gametogenesis. When they spawned and were fertilized, the investigators tested the embryos. Their results indicate that the different living conditions of the adults had an effect on the gene expression patterns of the offspring during the gastrula stage of early development. For example, maternal conditioning under upwelling conditions intensified the transcriptomic (aka every gene in the embryo) response of the offspring when they were raised under high versus low carbon dioxide conditions. Additionally, mothers that experienced upwelling conditions produced larger offspring. Experimental design showing crosses of nonupwelling-conditioned and upwelling-conditioned females with a single nonupwelling-conditioned male. The embryos from each cross were placed into high or low culturing vessels. / Courtesy of Molecular Ecology ""It was more dramatic than we expected. It's almost like the female could sense that her progeny were about to be released into some challenging conditions for early-stage development,""ù Hofmann said. ""In response, she primed her offspring and gave them tools to face stressful conditions. It's like she packed them a backpack of tools, including extra lipids.""ù Their results produced a snapshot of how offspring responded physiologically. ""The two groups were radically different,""ù lead author Juliet Wong, a graduate student in the Hofmann Lab, said. ""Urchin larvae from females exposed to low pH conditions had more genes turned on and were better prepared to handle stress. We were pretty surprised to see that.""ù One of the mechanisms driving alterations in gene expression is epigenetic change, where the female is able to change her offspring's genome to cause certain genes to be expressed differently. ""This work shows that a rapid adaptation response is likely possible in many organisms,""ù Hofmann said. ""We just haven't looked at these transgenerational or maternal effects in a climate change context before. Because purple sea urchin females can condition their progeny to experience future stress, the urchins have tools at hand to respond to changes like ocean acidification.""ù While most studies exploring TGP in marine organisms have examined transgenerational effects at the physiological level, very few have explored the molecular basis of these effects. This study explored how TGP impacts gene expression in organisms like sea urchins and examined molecular""êlevel transgenerational effects in marine organisms during their early stages of development. The researchers examined the role of TGP in the response of urchin embryos to a dynamic environmental factor (carbon dioxide) and found that parental experience greatly altered progeny gene expression patterns. When the offspring of mothers that experienced upwelling conditions were raised under two different carbon dioxide levels at a common temperature, they exhibited expression patterns that might be indicative of the combined carbon dioxide and temperature conditions the parental generation experienced, including a decrease in epigenetic and metabolic processes. This expression pattern persisted regardless of which carbon dioxide condition the progeny was raised under. Adult conditioning impacted how the progeny responded to high carbon dioxide levels, affecting ATP production, possibly for use in ion transport and ion homeostasis. These results might be indicative of mothers effectively priming their offspring to respond to similar conditions that they themselves experienced during gametogenesis. This study highlights the importance of transgenerational effects in the response of S. purpuratus to abiotic stress and provides support that in nature, TGP may be an important mechanism by which this species copes with rapid changes in the environment. A better understanding of these processes could make predictions regarding how S. purpuratus populations will react under future ocean conditions. ""For now, we know that female urchins are able to prepare their offspring to experience harsher conditions, more so than we ever thought, so our results are somewhat hopeful,""ù Hofmann said.

science,UCSB Researcher Evaluates Sundowner Winds,10-May-18,7:07 AM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/ucsb-researcher-evaluates-sundowner-winds/,"The Whittier Fire was a wildfire in the Santa Ynez Mountains, south of Lake Cachuma, along Highway 154 in Santa Barbara County. / Urban Hikers / Noozhawk photo One of the most beautiful views in Santa Barbara is seeing the Santa Ynez Mountains from the beach. However, this positioning can lead to dangerous situations when it comes to wildfires because the air heats and dries as it descends from the mountains to the sea. This phenomenon is known as sundowner winds. Gale force hot, dry winds can make firefighting impossible, and while conditions for these winds can be predicted in some cases, the mechanisms driving their spatial and temporal variability remain largely unknown. Existing scientific understanding of sundowners largely relies on a few case studies using regional models. For the first time, a team of scientists from UC Santa Barbara and San Jose State University has evaluated these winds in real time and studied how they vary with elevation. Understanding these aspects can help improve future sundowner forecasts on the ground, an extremely relevant and valuable tool during wildfires. The experiment determined that sundowners are associated with a nocturnal downslope low-level jet with a strong and narrow riverlike flow, a north-south orientation and speeds of about 30 mph at elevations between 328 and 490 feet above sea level. Sundowners happen throughout the year but are more common from March to May or early June when onshore winds weaken. The effect of the winds and temperature vary dramatically with the distance from the mountains. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons ""This was the first time that we effectively observed the evolution of a nocturnal jet over land in coastal Santa Barbara,""ù Leila Carvalho, a professor in UCSB's Department of Geography and the principal investigator on a National Science Foundation project called ""Understanding Extreme Fire Weather Hazards and Improving Resilience in Coastal Santa Barbara, California,""ù said. This latest Sundowner experiment was funded by a UCSB Faculty Research Grant. ""We have seen the jet in high-resolution model simulations before, but we had no way of confirming these features. Meteorological observations in Santa Barbara are limited to surface stations and do not provide weather information above the ground.""ù Sundowners happen throughout the year but are more common from March to May or early June, peaking from early evening to early morning, when onshore winds weaken. They are often associated with warm temperatures in the evenings accompanied by low relative humidity. The effect of the winds and temperature vary dramatically with the distance from the mountains. However, all of the major wildfires in Santa Barbara have been dramatically influenced by sundowners, including the recent Thomas Fire. ""Sundowners have played a role in all major wildfires in our region,""ù Carvalho said. ""I am studying these winds and also past fires and how sundowners played a role in spreading these fires. So this is part of my current research.""ù During the last weekend in April, when winds gusted to between 40 and 50 mph in the mountains, the researchers launched 13 radiosonde weather balloons that can reach 75,000 feet into the atmosphere at three-hour intervals. They were able to capture atmospheric profiles of winds, temperature, pressure and relative humidity. ""We don't have enough data sets to compare our models to understand mechanism, so this experiment was designed to increase our understanding by looking into the profile of winds, temperature and humidity to understand what happens when we have these strong winds,""ù Carvalho said. ""Observing the formation and evolution of the low-level jet was extremely important because ultimately these jets can cause mountain waves, which can be strong enough to cause ""òrotors' or eddies that are dangerous for aviation,""ù Carvalho said. ""These waves can intensify the gustiness of the winds as well. Therefore, being able to identify and forecast the spatial and temporal evolution of these jets is essential to improve the forecast of sundowner winds, particularly during wildfires.""ù The team's future research will focus on evaluating these features in models. By simulating these events using a regional model, they should be able to compare simulation profiles with actual observations made in the area for the first time. ""In the near future, our major goal is to have a comprehensive field campaign in the region,""ù Carvalho said. ""Santa Barbara has faced many disasters lately, and our research aims at improving understanding and advancing our modeling and forecasting capabilities of these events.""ù

science,Hippopotamus Dung Affects African Ecosystem,17-May-18,6:13 AM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/hippopotamus-dung-affects-african-ecosystem/,"† During the day, the 4,000 or so hippos by the Mara River in Tanzania return to rivers to keep cool and avoid sunburn. As they wallow, they constantly urinate and defecate, producing about 8,500 kilograms of waste a day. In sub-Saharan Africa, deforestation, water-intensive agriculture and climate change are significantly altering water cycles and causing many rivers to begin to dry. A recent study by UC Santa Barbara researcher Keenan Stears in collaboration with UC Berkeley and Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania compared river pools with high and low densities of Hippopotamus amphibius, also known as the common hippopotamus, to determine how H. amphibius subsidies shape the chemistry and ecology of aquatic communities. ""This work explores how hippo dung shapes freshwater chemistry and links these changes to associated patterns of aquatic biodiversity change,""ù Stears, a postdoctoral researcher in UCSB's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology (EEMB), said. ""It also illustrates that the net impact of hippos on river ecosystems is dynamically controlled by river hydrology and reveals the capacity of human disturbances on river flow to drastically alter the role of ecosystem-linking species.""ù The hippopotamus is a semiaquatic megaherbivore which can weigh over 1000 kilograms, about 2200 pounds. These animals consume large amounts of terrestrial vegetation, around 40 to 50 kg of wet mass, during nightly foraging bouts. After these foraging bouts, the hippopotamus returns to their aquatic refuges and spends most of the day resting and defecating. Over the course of their daily movements across ecosystem boundaries hippopotami deliver substantial, and continuous, supplies of terrestrially derived organic matter and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, to aquatic ecosystems. While the magnitude of these biologically mediated transfers is clearly high, it is important to understand how these inputs shape the chemistry of recipient aquatic systems and how such shifts in turn affect the ecology of aquatic communities. The study was conducted in the Ruaha National Park in central Tanzania, which forms part of the Great Ruaha ecosystem. The main source of water for wildlife within Ruaha National Park is the Great Ruaha River. Stears and his colleagues conducted observations for multiple years over wet and dry seasons to identify how hydrological variability influences the impacts of hippopotami. During the wet season, when the river was flowing, they detected no differences in water chemistry and nutrient parameters between pools with high and low densities of hippopotami. Likewise, the diversity and abundance of fish and aquatic insect communities were indistinguishable. During the dry season, however, high-density hippopotami pools differed drastically in almost all measured attributes of water chemistry and exhibited depressed fish and insect diversity and fish abundance compared with low-density hippopotami pools. ""During the dry season when there was no flow, the pools were completely separated,""ù Stears said. ""We found a huge buildup of hippo dung, and therefore nutrient concentrations within high-density hippo pools. The high influx of nutrients caused the dissolved oxygen concentration to decline to sublethal levels for most fish species.""ù Only a few species of fish and insects are able to survive in the hippo pools when the river dries, because of extreme losses of dissolved oxygen in these pools. Stears and his colleagues noted large reductions in fish diversity and abundance inside the pools that were overfueled by dung when river flow ceased. ""This suggests some kind of resilience within the system that allows it to recover after the hydrological disturbance every dry season,""ù Stears said. ""This resilience signifies that there is hope for this system, but without intervention soon, the chronic stress caused by river drying and overfertilizing of hippo dung may cause long-term species loss in this river system.""ù The Great Ruaha River in Ruaha National Park, Tanzania observed from the same vantage point during the wet season of 2015 (A) and the dry season of 2015 (B). During the wet season, flow connects pools in the river, whereas in the dry season, the river ceases flowing for several months every year. This results in large stretches of dry riverbed with isolated pools that are completely disconnected. However, it appeared to promote aquatic invertebrate diversity. Widespread human-driven shifts in hydrology appear to redefine the role of hippopotami, altering their influence on ecosystem diversity and functioning in a fashion that may be more severe than presently appreciated. Discerning the impacts of hippopotami upon this ecosystem is made more complex, and yet more important, because of its recent history of human modification. As has been documented elsewhere, hippopotami positively influence aquatic communities via nutrient provisioning during the wet season. However, as river discharge wanes, hippopotami switch, especially at the local scale, from being providers of resources for aquatic communities to largely serving as an agent of over enriching waters, eutrophication and biodiversity loss. The amplified negative effects observed during the dry season are likely new and may be shifting the balance of the net impacts that hippopotami have on watershed-level biodiversity. Climate change and accelerating water abstraction associated with rapidly expanding human populations across the range of hippopotami appear poised to further exacerbate deleterious eutrophication caused by hippopotami. This case study calls attention to the profound ways by which human alteration of environmental variables can drastically reshape the magnitude and directionality of species' effects on the chemistry and ecology of the ecosystems they inhabit. These findings also call attention to the profound ways in which the dry-season impacts of hippos may influence local communities that rely on rivers as a food source,""ù Stears said. ""Tilapia are a commonly consumed fish throughout Africa, and, during the dry season, we found that the presence of hippos reduced tilapia abundance by 41 percent across the watershed. That's not only bound to have ecological consequences but will also impact the human populations that rely on these rivers.""ù † Comments are closed.

science,Researchers Publish Special Edition Paper on Marine Biology,24-May-18,5:33 AM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/researchers-publish-special-edition-paper-on-marine-biology/,"Campus Point State Marine Conservation Area, the second largest of the coastal MPAs in our region, stretches along the Goleta coastline adjacent to UC Santa Barbara, Coal Oil Point Reserve and Devereux Slough. This MPA represents and protects a wide diversity of habitat types including eelgrass, surfgrass, kelp, rocky reefs, shallow subtidal, rocky intertidal, oil seeps, sand and the estuarine inputs of Devereux Slough. Research biologists from UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute (MSI) have edited a special edition of Marine Ecology that sets the stage for future long-term monitoring of marine protected areas. California's 1999 Marine Life Protection Act established a statewide network of marine protected areas (MPAs) to conserve marine life and habitats along the state's 1,100-mile coast. The first regional MPA was situated in the Central Coast region, covering Point Conception to Pigeon Point north of Santa Cruz, in 2007. The three areas that followed were the South Coast region, spanning from Point Conception to the California-Mexico border, including state waters around the Channel Islands.
The next step was for scientists to capture a snapshot of the ecosystems upon which future monitoring would be based. Jennifer Caselle and Carol Blanchette, both research biologists at MSI, led the charge to integrate and synthesize 10 baseline MPA monitoring projects from Southern California. UCSB held a number of workshops to encourage local researchers to work together. Now, five resulting papers have been published as a special edition of the journal Marine Ecology. Caselle and Liz Whiteman of the Ocean Science Trust edited the issue, which covers a range of topics from biodiversity to citizen science.
""Although the impetus for all this work came from the MPA program, the papers aren't necessarily about MPA performance,""ù Caselle said. ""Instead, they establish the baseline conditions at the implementation of the MPAs and set the path forward for long-term monitoring.""ù One of the papers on biodiversity drew from several different projects that conducted biological monitoring, looking for patterns across a variety of ecosystems: deep water rock and sand, shallow water rock, sandy beach and rocky intertidal. This was the first time that spatial patterns of biodiversity have been compared across such diverse habitats. Integrating results from monitoring efforts conducted across diverse marine ecosystems can provide opportunities to reveal novel biogeographic patterns at larger spatial scales and among multiple taxonomic groups. ""The idea was that if patterns of biodiversity are similar across different habitats, then perhaps the drivers of that biodiversity are the same across these really disparate habitats,""ù Caselle said. ""Where differences occur, we can start to think about the relative importance of various drivers such as oceanography or sea temperature. Our results, in fact, showed broadly similar patterns of biodiversity even in very different habitats.""ù One of the largest and deepest sea caves in the world, Painted Cave is found on the northwest coastline of Santa Cruz. Named for its colorful rock types, lichens and algae, Painted Cave is nearly a quarter mile long, with a 160-foot entrance ceiling and a waterfall over the entrance. Another paper explored different forms of citizen science. The researchers investigated different citizen science models, their program goals and contributions to MPA baseline monitoring, including their respective monitoring protocols and data quality assurance measures, in the context of the goals of the MLPA baseline monitoring program. The baseline program included three different citizen science projects: one utilizing highly trained volunteer scuba divers, a second based on young students and their teachers and a third involving commercial lobster fishermen. The paper analyzed these different models for citizen science as case studies. ""That's important because it shows investigators the constraints and benefits of different models,""ù Caselle, co-author of this paper, said. ""In addition, the results of the paper will inform citizen science monitoring up and down the state of California and likely globally.""ù A third paper explored the possibility of using seabirds as proxies for fish recruitment. The scientists compared an independent measure of juvenile fish abundance with a measure derived from seabird foraging and found that seabird-based estimates were similar to scuba-based estimates at larger scales. The findings support using seabird studies to provide additional information not captured by more conventional fish surveys. They also help resource managers better understand local patterns for communities of multiple and individual fish species. In other words, seabird studies can provide additional information not captured by fish surveys and help resource managers better understand local patterns of fish recruitment at the community level. This will help resource managers establish realistic expectations for how quickly fish populations should change within individual MPAs. The two final papers focused on creating indices ""î one for the health of rocky reefs and the other for fishing pressure across Southern California. ""The takeaway of the whole issue is that it gives a broader look at the marine ecosystems in the Southern California bight than has ever been done before,""ù Caselle said. ""The special issue provides some lessons on how disparate data sets taken by different researchers with varying disciplinary skills can offer broader insight to the ecology and to the human patterns in the region.""ù

science,Cloud Frequency and Formation Declines,6-Jun-18,10:51 PM,['Stephanie Pernett'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/cloud-frequency-and-formation-declines/,"Clouds may form when air encounters a mountain range. When this happens, the air will rise and cool, and this cooler air is no longer able to hold all of the water vapor it was able to hold when it was warm. The extra water vapor begins to condense out of the air parcel in the form of liquid water droplets and a cloud is formed. The types of clouds that form from encounters with mountains are stratus and lenticular clouds. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons In much of coastal southern California, the frequency of summer clouds has declined rapidly in recent decades due to warming from urbanization and greenhouse gases. These reductions have significantly reduced cloud shading and increased evaporative demand, particularly in greater Los Angeles and northern San Diego, such that a relatively cloudy summer today is similar to a relatively clear summer in the 1970s. According to a new study, a combination of intensifying urbanization and a warming climate are driving up summer temperatures and driving off once-common low-lying morning clouds in many southern coastal areas of the state. Further, the researchers, including Dar Roberts and Max Moritz from UC Santa Barbara, found that decreasing coastal cloud cover increases the chance of bigger and more intense wildfires. Clouds appear to be important regulators of summer wildfire activity in this region, as the shade they provide slows loss of moisture from vegetation. On the vegetated mountainsides that ring coastal Southern California's large cities, increases in summer sunlight and evaporative demand have likely enhanced summer wildfire potential over the past several decades. This effect is expected to continue due to continued urban expansion and positive feedbacks, where warming due to cloud loss promotes further warming and cloud loss. ""The decrease is driven mainly by urban sprawl, which increases near-surface temperatures; however, overall warming climate also contributes,""ù co-author Roberts, a professor in UCSB's Department of Geography, said. ""Increasing heat drives away clouds, which admits more sunlight. That in turn heats the ground further, leading to drier vegetation and higher fire risk.""ù The researchers used a unique set of decade-long observations of radiative flux, meteorology and cloud-base heights from a coastal southern California (CSCA) site to quantify the effects of warm-season cloud cover on surface radiation and evaporative demand. They then estimated how observed changes in cloud frequency and altitude have affected evaporative demand since the early 1970s. They hypothesized that warm-season cloud shading is an important determinant of evaporative demand, fuel moisture and burned area in CSCA, and that reduced cloud shading in recent decades has enhanced wildfire potential in the highly flammable ecosystems surrounding the region's large urban areas. Normally, stratus clouds form over CSCA during early morning hours within a thin layer of cool, moist ocean air sandwiched between the land and higher air masses that are too dry for cloud formation. The stratus zone's altitude varies with weather but sits at roughly 1,000 to 3,000 feet. Heat causes clouds to dissipate, and decades of intense urban growth plus global warming have gnawed away at the stratus layer's base, causing the layer to thin and clouds to burn off earlier in the day or disappear altogether. The Sun is visible through a layer of stratus clouds, which belong to the low cloud (surface-2000m up) group. Uniform gray and covering most or all of the sky, stratus clouds may appear as a low-hanging fog. Light mist or drizzle is sometimes associated with stratus clouds. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons ""Cloud bases have risen 150 to 300 feet since the 1970s,""ù Williams said. ""Clouds that used to burn off by noon or one o'clock are now gone by 10 or 11, if they form at all.""ù They found cloud formation and frequency declines were strongest in the most heavily urbanized and inland areas, as these areas have experienced the most rapid warming in recent decades. At airfields throughout the greater Los Angeles and northern San Diego areas of CSCA, daytime frequency of warm-season stratus clouds reduced significantly since the early 1970s and stratus cloud-base heights increased by several tens of meters, suggesting a thinning of the cloud deck. These trends appear driven by warming caused by urbanization and background greenhouse forcing, which enhance surface sensible heat fluxes and boundary layer entrainment. The unique pairing of a 10-year observational record of surface radiation fluxes with a record of cloud observations at a neighboring airfield in CSCA allowed the researchers to empirically model how changes in warm-season cloud frequency and base height affect evaporative demand. Applying their empirical model to observed cloud records, they estimate that changes in daytime cloud frequency and cloud-base height since the early 1970s have forced significant multi-decade increases in incident surface radiation and evaporative demand throughout greater Los Angeles and northern San Diego. These forced increases are similar in magnitude to the fluctuations expected from year-to-year variability. The results of this study suggest that among the complex processes governing fire activity in CSCA, reductions in warm-season cloud shading in recent decades have caused evaporative demand and wildfire potential to be higher than they would otherwise be when and where fuels are not limiting, particularly in wildland-urban areas that ring greater Los Angeles and San Diego. Effects of reduced stratus cloudiness on evaporative demand and wildfire in coastal California should be further researched through live fuel-moisture observations, satellite monitoring and modeling, particularly given projections of continued urbanization and expansion of the wildland urban areas and the likelihood for positive feedbacks where warming due to reduced cloud shading promotes further declines in cloud frequency and shading.

science,Get through the Siege,7-Jun-18,5:06 AM,['Jiaming Yang'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/get-through-the-siege/,"A photoswitch contains organic photochromic compounds that are excited by direct exposure to light, triggering a mechanical response. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Javier Read de Alaniz, the chemistry professor and the associate director of the California NanoSystem Institute (CNSI) at UCSB, recently embarked on a new $7.5 million, five-year Multidisciplinary Research Initiative (MURI)-funded project called ""Photochemical Materials Systems: From Molecules to Devices.""ù This new MURI team consists of several scholars from multiple fields and universities. It is led by polymer scientist Ryan Hayward, and the other group members are Christopher Bardeen of UC Riverside, Todd Martinez of Stanford, Read de Alaniz of UC Santa Barbara, physicist Peter Palffy-Muhoray of Kent State and mechanical engineer Kaushik Bhattacharya of CalTech. This MURI project is in the design stage right now, where Read de Alaniz put forward an idea about developing a new technology that can successfully realize the function of transporting work without relying on the physical devices to carry the energy. Talking about the overall planning for the group, Read de Alaniz said, ""The overarching goal of the project at this stage is to bring together a team with a wide variety of backgrounds to rethink how light-responsive materials are designed and fabricated.""ù He also talks about the hopeful short-term outcome of the research, in which there might be a set of design principles that can be used to create the optimal light-responsive material, and most likely there will not be one material for each envisioned application. The key to this new technology is to find the best suitable photoresponsive materials. In the research of MURI team, they try to get the access to such materials through the knowledge from different academic areas. In Read de Alaniz's explanation, this project will merge theory, modeling and simulations with synthesis, processing and characterization of new materials and systems across length-scales ranging from single molecules to bulk materials, culminating in the development of working light-driven devices. Quantum mechanical modeling will be an important way to find the ideal photoresponsive materials, and it will provide the basis for the synthesis of new classes of light-responsive compounds on the molecular scale, which will be paired with new approaches to self-assembly and material architecture on the mesoscale and systematic characterization of photoresponses on the macroscale, providing an integrated roadmap for the effective design of photomechanical materials. As one of the main members in this MURI project and a synthetic chemist, Read de Alaniz describes his role is to help design and synthesize new photochromic material and device novel approaches to assemble the material using material architectures that maximize photoresponses on the macroscale. Photoswitch is one of the important parts in this MURI project, and donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are very significant materials that were discovered by Read de Alaniz and his team. In his introduction, DASAs feature several important advantages compared to other photochromic material, including being visible to near-infrared light responsive, as many photochromic materials require UV light which is damaging to cells and materials, and having modular synthetic architecture, as this enables them to be readily incorporated into material for specific applications. They are also highly colored in their stable form. This means they can be used for many sensing applications where the naked eye can be used to visualize the response. Finally, they have negative photochromism. This means they convert from a colored state to a colorless state upon treatment with light. This feature is important because it enables light penetration into the bulk of the material which is necessary to drive a photoresponse throughout the material. Currently, there are many challenges that occur during the process of developing new materials because it is a totally new idea and nobody knows the design rules or what is actually possible. As Read de Alaniz said, ""There is debate around what is the ideal photoswitch, what type of material is best suited for generating a photomechanical response, what are the best metrics to use so that we can compare different systems. While there has been lots of work on many of the individual parts, we are basically starting with a blank slate. This is one of the attractive aspects of this project.""ù Even though it is a very brand new idea in the field of synthesis materials, the entire MURI team is still optimistic toward this optical light-responsive material due to the strong financial support, which is a $7.5 million dollar fund for three years with the possibility to extend to five years. Read de Alaniz also considers that it might take 15 years to take the photoresponsive materials into specific applications. Certainly, this MURI project has a large number of advantages for energy conservation. It is also a tremendous challenge for Javier and his team. However, with the close cooperation between scholars in the team and full support from CNSI and MURI, they will finally get through the siege and bring the new photoresponsive materials in the future.

science,Consciousness Conundrum,7-Jun-18,5:16 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/consciousness-conundrum/,"Michael Gazzaniga's book The Consciousness Instinct, explores consciousness. (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) / Courtesy of Michael Gazzaniga In everyday conversations, we often use the words ""mind""ù and ""brain""ù interchangeably. For psychologists and other researchers studying the mind-brain problem, the two terms hold very different meanings. The mind-brain problem highlights the quandary of distinguishing the brain, the physical organ, from the mind, associated with thought, feelings and consciousness. What is the nature of consciousness, and how does it fit in the relationship between the mind and the brain? In his new book titled The Consciousness Instinct: Unraveling the Mystery of How the Brain Makes the Mind, Michael Gazzaniga, a professor of psychology and Director of the SAGE Center for the Study of the Mind at UC Santa Barbara, explores such ideas. ""How do neurons become the mind? That is the big gap in mind-brain research and all kinds of research, actually. How do you get from one layer to the next? There are ideas in the book about it that build upon the work of a theoretical biologist named Howard Pattee, that you have to think of it as a problem of complementary. There is a physical brain producing a code which then becomes a symbolic representation, and you have to put both of those together to understand the full problem. You can't talk about one or the other,""ù Gazzaniga said. Featuring a range of topics regarding consciousness, Gazzaniga's book includes clinical studies showing the kinds of deficits in consciousness that occur with such conditions including brain lesions, strokes and dementia, as well as ideas about how the brain is possibly organized and how we should think about what consciousness is. ""[The book is] an attempt to bring together a lot of historic information and some scientific thoughts on what we mean when we talk about consciousness,""ù he said. He describes consciousness as a ""suitcase""ù word, containing many different meanings to different people, which he unpacks in his book. According to him, in neuroscience, consciousness is an existing ""thing""ù that can be understood through the complicated brain network interacting in a particular way to produce the sensation of a real experience of personal consciousness. ""What I argue in the book is that our brain is actually made of all kinds of independent modules,""ù Gazzaniga said. ""And each of those modules have the capacity to produce this felt sense ""î that when we have a cognitive action, we have a memory of a felt sense about it ""î and what we're calling consciousness is actually the expression of these independent modules through time.""ù In an analogy, Gazzaniga compares the concept of consciousness to boiling water. As each subsequent bubble rises in heated water, through time, it appears as the unified experience of boiling water. ""In fact, it's each of these bubbles, or modules, which have the capacity to give it this dimension, this felt state. The same way of thinking applies to consciousness. [The independent modules] are being expressed and through time, we call that consciousness.""ù The concept of consciousness has been around since the Greeks first came up the idea that it was produced by the mind/body. Then in the next 1,700 years, another idea emerged, agreeing with the Greeks that the brain generates the mind but adding that there is a ""òsoul' that leaves the body once a person dies. A third view, Descartes' concept of dualism, offers the idea that the mind is independent of the brain and makes contact in the brain at certain sites, like the pineal gland or elsewhere, to produce consciousness. ""As I see it, those are the three ideas we've come up with that have endured through history,""ù Gazzaniga said. ""What I do in the book is take that all the way up to modern times. There was a conference at the Vatican in 1962, and the three leading neuroscientists at that conference had three different views, each with one of the views I'd just described. And if you go to a neuroscience meeting today, you'd hear those three views. So people hang onto a perspective on consciousness, independent of the data and the world around them, and how it's being viewed by scientific folks. One doesn't have to conclude from reading this book that you should abandon all other ideas. This one should be one that's discussed as well.""ù Ultimately, Gazzaniga hopes his book will contribute to the discussion about consciousness and even inspire future researchers to tackle the mind-brain conundrum. ""This book, in particular, I hope has appeal to people in engineering, biology, psychology and elsewise because, really, understanding this problem is for a future generation. We're nibbling at the edges and giving it our best shot [now], but it's a complicated problem and a good one to try to solve.""ù

science,"No Longer a ‚""Foote‚""ù Note",7-Jun-18,5:30 AM,['Aimee Miller'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-07/no-longer-a-foote-note/,"The cover for the breakthrough paper of Eunice Newton Foote, the first person to demonstrate that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and that adding more to the atmosphere will cause global warming, is shown. / Courtesy of John Perlin When it comes to crediting one of the most consequential discoveries of the past two centuries, the scientific community is mistaken. Over 150 years ago, Eunice Newton Foote released her findings on carbon dioxide's emitting power of heat, setting the stage for the field of climate science as well as ushering in the era of recognition of greenhouse gases and their effects on global warming. Foote delineated her key discoveries in the paper ""Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun's Rays""ù where she stated that carbon dioxide is the greatest heat-retaining gas in the atmosphere and that more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will lead to a hotter Earth. Her paper was presented on August 23, 1856 at an annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). However, Foote was unable to present her own findings, which were instead presented by a male professor, due to the fact that Foote was a female and women were not respected as true scientists at the time. As it happens, Foote was just one of two female scientists who were even permitted to be members of the AAAS in 1856. Aspiring to illuminate the untold story of Foote, a symposium was held at UCSB on May 17, titled ""Science Knows No Gender: In Search of Eunice Foote Who 162 Years Ago Discovered the Principal Cause of Global Warming.""ù The event was co-sponsored by the Environmental Justice (EJ)/Climate Justice (CJ) Hub of the UCSB Orfalea Center for Global and International Studies, whose goal is to promote scholarship regarding environmental and climate justice by connecting people from around the world who share interests and passions in striving for justice on a global scale. A speaker at the event, John Perlin, a research scholar in UCSB's Department of Physics, has spent three years investigating Foote and her work. He described her narrative as ""one of America's great stories that has never been told.""ù Perlin compared the lack of knowledge regarding Foote's discoveries to other household name scientists. ""It's like no one knowing about Einstein or Darwin and then doing their work even though it was available, and simply no one had seen it. It makes Foote an incredible scientist, whether male or female,""ù Perlin said. Perlin's research sheds light on the fact that Foote's findings predate physicist John Tyndall by at least five years, although Tyndall is currently considered to be the discoverer of carbon dioxide's greenhouse gas effects. Convener of the EJ/CJ Hub and professor of sociology at UCSB John Foran addresses the fact that Tyndall's work published five years after Foote received attention from the scientific community, which resulted in the accreditation of much of Foote's research under Tyndall's name. ""John Perlin effectively shows that it is almost inconceivable that Tyndall did not know of Foote's work; yet Tyndall not only doesn't credit it, he almost goes out of his way to say that no one has ever really written about the problem,""ù Foran said. ""By a textbook definition of plagiarism, which is to omit credit for someone's ideas and put them forward as if they are solely your own, it's a case of plagiarism, and it can be attributed in good part to Tyndall as a product of his time, where science was male-dominated and where Foote, at best, would have appeared to be an amateur scientist coming from a less scientifically advanced society in terms of America compared to the United Kingdom,""ù Foran added. In an effort to address this lack of accreditation, the symposium portrayed Foote's story through the lens of a comprehensive history. ""Everyone's breakthroughs are not achieved as individual accomplishments, rather they build on previous science, and so what John Perlin is trying to do is restore Foote to her rightful place in that history,""ù Foran explained. ""In doing so, he is drawing attention to the remarkable advances that this represented for women in science.""ù By unveiling Foote as one of the greatest scientists of the last 200 years, Perlin is hoping to provide a heroine that young women can look up to.
""The goals of the symposium were to bring to light this amazing scientist who few knew about, to inspire young women to take her example and realize that despite continuing prejudices, science knows no gender and to illustrate the deep roots that climate science was built upon,""ù he stated. Perlin believes that the symposium could act as a launch for further recognition of Foote's accomplishments, including an exhibit at the UCSB library or lectures on campus. Additionally, he emphasizes the existing Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in the UK and his hope to one day see the Eunice Foote Center for Atmospheric Studies at UCSB.

The traditional range of this cetacean species, including in the Gulf of Maine and the Scotian Shelf, is based on their main food source, the marine zooplankton Calanus finmarchicus. Due to anthropogenic warming, prey availability in the Gulf of Maine has been low since 2011 and is expected to further decrease, causing speculation of a shift of the right whale's habitat range and a decline in their numbers. The right whale's low rate of calving ""î with only five calves born in 2017 and none yet sighted in 2018 ""î reflects the decline in prey in their traditional feeding grounds.  Right whales also face high mortality rates due to ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear.  In summer 2017, when waters between the U.S. and Canada revealed a high mortality event of 17 whale carcasses that were most ascribed to ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement, it was confirmed that a portion of the whale population had moved northward, away from their usual feeding habitats. Compared to data collected since 1970, it was more than a five-fold increase in confirmed mortalities.  ""As right whales follow their prey north, they†enter waters where there are few management regulations to protect them. This may explain the huge increase in anthropogenic mortalities observed in 2017 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,""ù Erin Meyer-Gutbrod, an ecologist of UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute, said.  Along with Charles H. Greene of Cornell University and Kimberly T.A. Davies of Dalhousie University, Meyer-Gutbrod published a paper in the journal Oceanography detailing their findings and recommendations for advanced protective policies for the right whale. With the decline in prey in its usual feeding habitats, the endangered North Atlantic right whale lacks energy for successful reproduction. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Current protection policies, including alternative routing zones and speed limits for vessels, have significantly reduced the death rates of right whales from ship strikes. †But without updating protection policies to reflect the right whale's shifting distribution, the researchers predict the right whale may go extinct in as soon as 27 years.  In their paper, Meyer-Gutbrod and colleagues urge for further strategies to be implemented in addition to the ones already applied to vessels and for fisheries, such as the ban of certain fishing gear in a fixed closed area in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, as designated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. They said, ""In the long term, effective policies should be expanded globally to encourage management that is proactive instead of just reactive.""ù These include to ""expand monitoring programs to characterize right whale use of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and look for new habitats that have not yet been discovered, [and] reinstate the Gulf of Maine Continuous Plankton Recorder program, which is useful for monitoring prey availability in some of the right whales' most important feeding grounds,""ù Meyer-Gutbrod said.  They also propose expanding fishing policies so as to ""minimize the spatial and temporal overlap between snow crab fishery gear and right whales""ù, and to test and implement modified fishing gear that could reduce entanglement.  While their report focuses on the North Atlantic right whale, the scientists note that other marine top predators under protective policies may be facing range shifts as well. According to Meyer-Gutbrod, this could potentially affect fishery sustainability, particularly for the least-developed countries.  ""Under mounting pressure from increased anthropogenic stressors to marine ecosystems, the timely implementation and adaptation of conservation and management policies is critical to the health of the global ocean and its living inhabitants. As it has in the past, the future fate of iconic species such as the North Atlantic right whale, and the ecosystem that it depends upon and contributes to, will be determined by these policy decisions,""ù the researchers said.

science,Pacific O.R.C.A. Expedition,6-Jul-18,8:30 PM,['Kirstie Allen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-06/pacific-o-r-c-a-expedition/,"Members of the Pacific ORCA science team deploy an ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) to the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean. / Courtesy of Zach Eilon On a beautiful Saturday morning in April, researchers set out on a mission aboard the U.S Navy Research vessel Kilo Moana. The cruise departed from San Diego and set sail to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Yes, that's right, the middle of Pacific Ocean. It may sound like an odd destination; however, the purpose of this voyage was to deploy 30 ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) onto the seafloor. The name of this mission: Pacific OBS Research into Convecting Asthenospher, or Pacific O.R.C.A. for short. The OBSs will sit about 4,500 meters ""î a little under three miles beneath the ocean's surface ""î for 15 months, recording earthquakes across the globe. The goal of the OBS deployments is to produce 3D images of the oceanic tectonic plates, which can be compared to taking a C.A.T. scan of someone's head, except instead of a person, it's Earth's inner structure.  Ocean-bottom seismic receivers record the energy coming from natural sources such as earthquakes, which allow seismologists or scientists to create 3D images of the segments of inner Earth through which this energy has traveled.  With C.A.T. scans there is total control, but with Earth there are limitations. Those limitations are from not having sources all over, only where natural earthquakes occur. Or even worse ""î not having seismometers all over the surface.  ""The overall goal of the experiment was to measure the structure of the Earth's interior several hundred kilometers, in both vertical and horizontal dimension, within the heart of the Pacific tectonic plate ""î a region where no one has been before,""ù said Zach Eilon, assistant professor of Earth Science at UCSB and co-principal investigator of Pacific O.R.C.A. More specifically, the project allows researchers to investigate the structure and properties of the asthenosphere, particularly in the selected region of the Pacific Ocean. The asthenosphere, part of Earth's mantle, is a layer of hot, mostly solid rock that lies just below the tectonic plates. A point of interest for this experiment is understanding the scale and vigor at which convection (temperature-driven mixing currents) take place within the Earth's mantle, which includes the asthenosphere.  ""Monitoring of the asthenosphere allows researchers to understand the implications of hazards, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes, while trying to solve the mystery of Earth's dynamic behavior. As previously mentioned, the only way to get this data would be through the use of OBSs, which monitor these seismic observations on the seafloor. The OBSs offer very precise measurements of ground motion with sufficient sensitivity to detect sub-millimetre movements of the ground caused by earthquakes on the other side of the world,""ù Eilon said. Researchers inspect an OBS before it will be deployed. / Courtesy of Zach Eilon The capabilities of the OBSs are extraordinary because not only do the seismometers have to survive the technological challenges of operating under the crushing weight of about three miles of water, low temperatures and water currents on the ocean floor, but they are also operating autonomously for a year at a time. In addition, OBSs are entrusted with the task to place their seismic sensor into the seafloor mud all on their own.  ""It's a tremendous technological feat that we can actually release these off the side of a ship and have them come back up to the surface a year later, holding invaluable data in their memory banks from a part of the Earth that we've never before had the ability to look at,""ù Eilon said.  Pacific O.R.C.A. is the United States' contribution to an international grassroots effort to instrument the ocean floors, organized by a large and growing set of researchers and academics at universities across the globe. UCSB was one of three institutions awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to carry out this high-profile research experiment. In 2020, Pacific O.R.C.A. will have a second array deployment to further expand their research.

science,UCSB Joins Large-Scale Cancer Research Consortium,6-Jul-18,9:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-06/ucsb-joins-large-scale-cancer-research-consortium/,"UCSB has been selected as one of 13 research institutions nationwide to be part of the new Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center (ACE) consortium, which intends to bring together leading researchers to approach understanding cancer in a revolutionary new way. Led by Arizona State University, ACE has received a five-year grant of over $8.5 million from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to serve as part of its large-scale initiative to support the NCI's Cancer Systems Biology Consortium.  The researchers will apply principles of evolutionary biology and ecology to cancer biology. Through looking at cancer from these novel perspectives, they hope to yield new insights for methods and tools for cancer treatment, prognosis, prevention and better fundamental understanding of the complex disease. ""While [evolution and ecology are] not main fields in cancer biology, I think they are gaining traction. It's been known for a while that tumors evolve, go through rounds of somatic mutation, have subclones and are quite diverse in their genomics. Having a better understanding of this can help us lean toward different cancer treatment strategies. We know that tumors can have resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy drugs, [which is] very similar to looking at bacteria and the resistance that evolved to antibiotics. Applying the same principles to looking at tumor biology, it's really important to take an evolutionary and ecological perspective of that,""ù Amy Boddy, an assistant professor in UCSB's Department of Anthropology, said. Tumors, or groups of cancer cells, evolve as cells divide rapidly and in an uncontrolled manner. Researchers will approach studying cancer biology from evolutionary biology and ecological perspectives. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The research will focus on different levels of biological organization, from the cell level to tumor evolutionary and ecology dynamics to the species level to understand the susceptibility of different species to cancer.  The latter level is what Boddy, the lead on the organismal level portion of the project at UCSB, will concentrate on with her research. Using data from zoos and independent organizations to look at cancer rates and susceptibility for numerous species, she will build computational models and sequences and look for novel cancer defense mechanisms exhibited in various organisms. ""What we see is that cancer is a common phenomenon across the tree of life, although certain species vary in their susceptibility,""ù she said. ""Some animals are seemingly cancer-resistant, such as the naked mole rat. Other species are quite cancer susceptible, such as small rodents and even domesticated species, like dogs. And so starting to tease apart the genomic mechanisms and mapping the potential tradeoffs organisms may have against cancer is an exciting new avenue to look at essentially broad cancer defense mechanisms across the tree of life.""ù  A good example of such a species, Boddy said, is elephants. Because cancer is a problem of unregulated cell division and genetic mutations, in principle ""î if all else is equal in terms of cancer defense mechanisms ""î the more cells an organism has, the higher the probability that it could have a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene that could potentially lead to cancer. Elephants have more cells than humans; they're much larger animals. So, the cancer rates in elephants should be significantly higher than in humans, right? Not so, according to the researchers' actual observations.  ""There's something called Peto's paradox [in which] although elephants are much bigger than humans [and] we expect them to have much more cancer than in humans, that's not what we observe. We do not observe elephants dropping dead of cancer all the time. Inherently, just from observed principles and theories, there must be additional tumor suppressor or cancer defense mechanisms in elephants,""ù Boddy said.  Indeed, some of Boddy's collaborators at the ACE center discovered that elephants have additional copies of an important tumor suppressor gene, p53.  ""That's potentially one of the mechanisms that certain organisms have to overcome in order to grow big, live a long time and also defend against cancer,""ù Boddy said. According to her, using broad evolutionary and ecological perspectives to look at cancer across the tree of life could help make great strides in cancer prevention and treatment mechanisms.  Boddy said, ""Each lineage has probably had to solve the cancer problem many, many times in evolution with multicellularity. And then with complexity and getting bigger or living longer, we have additional cancer suppression mechanisms. Mapping out how these different organisms solve the problem of cancer defenses provides us a road map or guidance on what are the molecular tools that actually work at defending against or treating cancer.""ù

While not as mythical as the bridge, UC Santa Barbara's own recently acquired BIFROST, or Broadly-tunable Illumination Facility for Research, Outreach, Scholarship, and Training, parallels in its multispectral and connective character. BIFROST is a titanium:sapphire laser with frequency doubling and sum frequency generation modules, distributed by a network of optical fibers to ten research and teaching laboratories in Broida Hall, which contains UCSB's Department of Physics. ""The idea is that it's like a faucet for laser light. A unique web interface including a ""òdial-a-wavelength' feature will allow researchers in any of the laboratories†to log on to the instrument,†select a desired wavelength or tuning range, and simply begin their work,""ù said David Weld, an assistant professor of physics who led the efforts to bring BIFROST to campus. The system is capable of producing spectroscopy-grade laser light at wavelengths from 350 nanometers to 1,000 nanometers, a range which spans nearly all visible colors and the near-infrared. ""Precise and†powerful light sources are a critical enabling technology for research directions including atom and ion trapping, terahertz†science, the study of†solid-state defects, single-molecule biophysics, molecular spectroscopy, and cavity quantum electrodynamics. BIFROST should open up new possibilities for research in all these areas at UCSB,""ù Weld said. David Weld shows part of BIFROST to UCSB Physics students and alumni. / Courtesy of David Weld In addition, he said that undergraduate students can profit from access to the unique apparatus, which enhances their education through new experimental possibilities for upper-division laboratory classes such as optical spectroscopy, microscopy, and quantum optics with†fluorescent defects in solid-state materials. ""As a side benefit, the fiber infrastructure installed as part of BIFROST†constitutes a sort of ""òoptical circulatory system' for Broida Hall,""ù Weld said. ""By plugging the BIFROST fibers into each other, it will be possible to connect any†two of the fiber-equipped†rooms to each other with a continuous single-mode fiber link. This will significantly expand future research collaboration possibilities.""ù The Army Research Office and U.S. Department of Defense's instrumentation grant program supported the installation of BIFROST at UCSB, due to its status as a minority-serving institution. With one of the largest physics bachelor's programs in the United States, UCSB welcomes the $600,000 instrument's timely arrival. Weld said, ""As a top-ten physics department in a minority-serving institution, the UCSB†physics department is in a unique position to positively impact the training of†the next generation†of researchers.""ù

science,UC‚'s Communication Strategies for Carbon Neutrality,23-Jul-18,1:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-23/ucs-communication-strategies-for-carbon-neutrality/,"Collaborators discuss ideas for achieving carbon neutrality in the UC system. / Courtesy of Strategic Communication to Achieve Carbon Neutrality within the University of California, Report of the UC TomKat Carbon Neutrality Project Launched in 2013, the University of California's Carbon Neutrality Initiative (CNI) aims to reduce UC carbon emissions to eliminate its reliance on fossil fuels and have net-zero emissions by 2025, while aligning with the university's core missions of education, research and public service. From a diverse council consisting of researchers, administrators, faculty and students from across the UC system, the report ""Strategic Communication to Achieve Carbon Neutrality within the University of California""ù outlines tactics to meet the university's ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2025. The report is part of the TomKat UC Carbon Neutrality Project, which focuses on developing feasible, scalable solutions to address eliminating university reliance on natural gas and to increase communications and greater awareness of the CNI. Another team released a second report in February 2018 to address strategies to replace UC's natural gas usage with climate-friendlier options. The CNI states it will need continuing efforts by stakeholder groups and multifarious parties, as well as engagement and cooperation across the UC community to reduce the university's carbon footprint. ""Right now, much of the university community is not aware of the initiative or the goals of the initiative, and there's better chances of success if we have a large supportive group of students, faculty, staff, besides just the experts who are working on this. This will benefit from support for some of the investments that are needed, as well as bubbling up new ideas,""ù said Roger Bales, one of the leads for the working group on strategic communications to advance the CNI and an engineering professor at UC Merced. The university's findings are applicable beyond the UC system to other large energy institutions aiming for carbon neutrality. Beyond the technical or communications aspects, this is due to methods and ideas that speak to broad human behavior, as noted by Stacy Rebich-Hespanha, also a working group lead as part of UC Santa Barbara's National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). ""At the most fundamental level, what we're talking about are human motivation and human behavior and what makes people get excited, enthusiastic and willing to make something happen. That is, ownership and involvement and creating models that can scale very broadly. It's about inviting people into the creative decision-making process and helping them to make the project theirs in certain ways that satisfy the individual participants' goals but also the institution's goals and moving projects forward that way. Those are very scalable, transferable ideas to any kind of organization that's facing the same kind of challenges that UC is,""ù Rebich-Hespanha said. The proposed collaboratory's relationship to campus sustainability and energy solutions on campuses and across the UC system. / Courtesy of Strategic Communication to Achieve Carbon Neutrality within the University of California, Report of the UC TomKat Carbon Neutrality Project One of the report's two central recommendations is to create system-wide, campus-based ""collaboratories,""ù or living labs with applied-research and education opportunities for campus energy solutions through classes, energy-management projects and other CNI components aligning with the university's core missions. The collaboratory is intended to bring greater visibility to the CNI's campaign and develop a foundational ethos for UC by providing a way to bring students, faculty and staff together to work together on energy solutions. ""By using the UC as a collaboratory for energy solutions, we see that it's easier to produce scalable solutions,""ù Bales said. ""For example, maybe what's happening at Santa Barbara can be applied to Los Angeles, or it can also be applied to other universities. So we need to learn from each other and have a ready way to share that information. A collaboratory would provide that way to get the word out on what works and what doesn't work.""ù The second headlining recommendation calls for data transparency to facilitate champions of the CNI to engage others and communicate the goals and strategies for carbon neutrality within their local campus communities. The data will allow greater access of information about campus energy usage and pathways pursuing carbon neutrality to students, faculty and staff. This includes directly acknowledging potential challenges and costs. ""Right now, throughout the UC as a whole, there are a lot of people who are passionate about taking action to address climate change amongst student bodies. We realized it's not about convincing people that something useful will happen, it's more about showing a pathway that looks feasible to make things happen. Where it becomes really difficult is when taking these kinds of actions is seen as preventing or taking away from achieving a mission at the university. Then people start thinking of it as something where if we invest resources into achieving an environmental goal, then we're going to have to give up things that we care about elsewhere in terms of education affordability or research output,""ù Rebich-Hespanha said.  ""I think what the ultimate discovery that our group made is that it's possible to think about things not in that way, but instead in another way, of tying them all together so that taking action that helps reduce the university's emissions also is helping to achieve the research mission and education mission. Coming up with as many opportunities for those kinds of projects is a really important way to carbon neutrality and emissions reductions more generally for the university forward,""ù she said.

Phytoplankton consume carbon dioxide and play a key role in transferring carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons NASA's EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing campaign, or EXPORTS, allows researchers to understand the future of the global ocean primary production and its impacts on the ocean's carbon cycle. The objective of EXPORTS is to design reliable models that would allow researchers to assess the interactions of the ocean ecosystems as well as the carbon cycle from satellite data on a global level.  When the acronym is broken down, ""export processes""ù refers to biological material that is carried into the ""twilight zone""ù of the ocean. In this deep part of the ocean, carbon remains hidden for a long time before making its return to the atmosphere. This process, which moderates climate, is also known as the ""biological pump""ù. ""The main goal of the project is to understand how the biological pump works in the context of physical and biological conditions in the ocean surface and ""òtwilight zone' and to develop ways of assessing the biological pump globally using satellite-based remote sensing,""ù said Norm Nelson, research oceanographer at the Earth Research Institute at UCSB.  The plan is for EXPORTS to measure the pathways in which organic carbon is transported from the upper ocean into the ocean interior. The ocean interior is the place where carbon is withdrawn from contact with the atmosphere. EXPORTS is designed to assess all the main pathways in the biological pump at the same time under varying environmental conditions.  ""These pathways deliver organic carbon to depths where it is respired back to dissolved carbon dioxide but sequestered from the atmosphere for months to millenia depending upon the circulation of the ocean,""ù said David Siegel, professor of marine science at UCSB. † There are two major expeditions planned for EXPORTS: one will be to the Northeast Pacific in the later months of 2018 and the other one will be to the North Atlantic in the year 2020. It is on those expeditions where researchers will be able to make the measurements for the biological communities, as well as the physical and chemical environments at the field sites. Researchers will also be studying the optical properties of the water column and its components, which will be important for developing remote sensing techniques, said Nelson.  Additionally, autonomous vehicles, such as gliders, drifters, profiling floats and tethered profiling instruments, will be scoping out the regions before, during and after researchers arrive on scene. This allows for more time that can be spent on the site to study the change of seasons.  Since there is a team of more than 100 people contributing to the EXPORTS campaign, there will be two ships going out to sea for the expedition. These two ships, named R/V Roger Revelle and R/V Sally Ride, are essentially floating laboratories enabling research to take place.  R/V Roger Revelle, known as a ""process ship""ù, will make detailed rate measurements, staying drift with the currents at the center of the study area. The researchers aboard R/V Roger Revelle will be conducting a significant and wide variety of experimental work.  R/V Sally Ride, known as the ""survey ship""ù, will travel around the R/V Roger Revelle making measurements in grids in order to quantify the spatial variability of the environment.  ""We know surprisingly little about how ocean ecosystems interact with the carbon cycle in a predictive way. There are many feedbacks linking the function of ocean ecosystems [and] their carbon cycle to the circulation of the ocean. We need to make predictions to understand and to plan how our environment will change in a warming climate,""ù said Siegel.

science,Doing More Harm Than Good?,2-Aug-18,8:00 AM,['Simran Kaur'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-02/doing-more-harm-than-good/,"In the aftermath of the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides, Santa Barbara County saw an onslaught of community efforts aimed toward preventing future disasters; however, new research suggests that these preventative measures may have done more harm than good. A multidisciplinary team of researchers from UC Santa Barbara and the University of Washington found that short-term responses to climate-change-related disasters can be ""inefficient and even maladaptive in the long-term.""ù Their paper, ""The dangers of disaster-driven responses to climate change,""ù appears in the Nature Climate Change journal and examines how salience influences poor responses to natural disasters. Sarah Anderson, a professor and social scientist at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, served as the lead author on this paper. She points to wildfires in Santa Barbara as an example of salient natural disasters that incite public demand for immediate government response. These immediate solutions usually focus on short-term management and can often be ineffective at controlling future wildfires. Their research shows that government agencies tend to place fuel management projects near areas that have already experienced wildfires in an attempt to reduce the severity of future wildfires. Outrage and demand for government action among affected communities can contribute to the placement of these projects. However, wildfires reduce the amount of fuel on landscapes; therefore, similar communities that haven't experienced wildfires are more likely to be at risk. In the case of wildfires, public opinion may result in the inefficient allocation of resources that often does little to address long-term issues. ""Humans are creatures who pay attention to what's in front of us, and it's almost like we pay too much attention to what's to in front of us,""ù says Anderson. ""We over-respond to a particular wildfire, rather than having measured, consistent and persistent engagement with that risk.""ù The Thomas Fire reaches the Los Padres National Forest near Ventura and Santa Barbara. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons This phenomena of ineffective, short-term responses can also be observed in relation to other climate-change-mediated disasters, such as diseases and floods. For example, modern engineering and landscape designs intended to contain floods actually store more water, resulting in longer and more intense floods. Since climate-change-induced changes to the hydrologic cycle will also increase the duration and intensity of floods, long-term solutions to climate change may be a more effective response to this issue. According to Anderson, our political system contributes to the popularity of short-term solutions to climate-change-mediated disasters. Due to short reelection cycles, elected officials often don't focus on long-term solutions to disasters. Additionally, researchers have found that voters don't reward politicians for creating long-term solutions and preparedness. Because government agencies are overseen by short-term politicians, they can be pushed to respond myopically as well. Despite some shortcomings of disaster-driven responses, the salience that inspires them may have the potential to prepare us for a safer future. ""This paper has led us to think about conducting further studies of people who have experienced a recent disaster to try to understand how to take advantage of the salience phenomenon to get long-term responses,""ù Anderson said. Further research is being done in Montecito and in other communities that have experienced disasters to better comprehend the effects of these events on human behavior. The findings of these studies may offer valuable insight on how to harness salience to encourage societal investment in long-term solutions.

science,Going with the Flow,9-Aug-18,8:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-09/going-with-the-flow/,"A waterfall transitions into a pool, flowing into a rocky riffle. / Photo by David Herbst Just as peaks and valleys outline mountains, riffles and pools characterize streams.  Working with the U.S. Forest Service, UC Santa Barbara researchers have been tracking the spatial and physical trends of the benthic, or bottom-dwelling, stream invertebrates within pool and riffle habitats in the Kings River drainage basin in the Sierra Nevada.  With long-term data obtained from 12 streams between 2002 and 2015, the scientists have discovered consistent patterns among the communities of invertebrates and how they respond to varying stream flow in their differing habitat types formed by pools and riffles. Their research appears in the journal Hydrobiologia.  ""What we studied was changing conditions of flows in the streams that was a result of how much variation there was in snowfall. The crux of the work really relates to the differences between riffles and pools. Riffles are these shallow water rocky environments where the flow is typically turbulent. A lot of people think of them as areas where there are rapids. The other main type of stream environment is deeper areas of slow-moving water called pools. The former is a very erosional habitat, and the latter is a very depositional habitat,""ù said David Herbst, lead author and research biologist at UCSB's Marine Science Institute and Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory.  Over the period, Herbst and his team collected nearly 300 species of aquatic invertebrates with high-resolution taxonomic data analysis often at the species level. In addition to the community structure, they studied density, abundance, and traits including life history and body size distribution of the invertebrate community.  ""The overall community structure was very, very different [between riffles and pools]. There is some overlap in the species where they can inhabit both pools and riffles, but there were many specialists that were found in just riffles or just pools. And those corresponded to a lot of the traits that you might expect them to exhibit in terms of the food that's available in those habitat types and the adaptations they have for living in different current velocities, for example,""ù Herbst said.  The researchers found distinct differences in the groups of organisms between the two habitats. Larger-bodied, longer-lived insects that are more sensitive to environmental disturbances,including mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, live in riffles. In pools, the relatively small and shorter-lived midges and mites dominate. Their physiology and body size allows them to have a better chance to survive under pool water quality conditions, including low levels of dissolved oxygen and sediment accumulation. The mayfly Ironodes is one of the stream invertebrates commonly found in riffles. / Photo by Bruce Medhurst ""Maybe the most surprising thing about that was there is a fair bit of literature about where species are thought to have occurred in riffles and pools, and we found that almost half of the total species that we studied did not correspond to what we expected from the literature,""ù Herbst said. ""We discovered some new things about the occurrence of these organisms in riffles and pools by virtue of being able to do these long-term studies and really detailed taxonomic analysis.""ù As riffles and pools provide the foundation for stream habitats and environments, they can reveal much about the basic ecology of streams.  ""One of the things we found was that even though there are very distinct differences between riffles and pools, if the current velocity of the flow in the stream was very high or got very low, the communities of the riffles and pools started to look more like one another and started to become more similar. Because of the fact that when flows are so low, the riffles became these habitats where sediment deposition could occur, and so we found a lot more of the pool-dwelling species starting to be able to live in the riffles as well,""ù Herbst said.  According to Herbst, his data shows the importance of taking separate samples for pools and riffles in evaluating the health of streams using aquatic invertebrates. Most samples in water quality monitoring practices mix habitats of riffles and pools, he said, which may not as accurately account for the effects of other factors such as pollution that may cause changes in water quality.  Herbst emphasizes the importance of not overlooking certain organisms just because of their diminutive size.  ""If you want to do biological research that is important for the conservation of species or conservation of habitats, you need to look everywhere. You need to turn over every stone, so to speak, in being able to evaluate what organisms live where and be able to account for all of them so that we better understand where organisms live and what their requirements are,""ù Herbst said.

science,More than Meets the Eye,13-Aug-18,8:00 AM,['Simran Kaur'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-13/more-than-meets-the-eye-3/,"Eyes originated multiple times during evolution in jellyfish, including box jellyfish (Cubozoa). / Courtesy of Wikipedia Commons The eyes can convey a great deal of information, and a recent study indicates that this quality applies not only to human visual organs, but also to jellyfish. Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have found that eyes in jellyfish evolved separately from other animals, providing insights about the evolution of these complex organs in simpler animals. The researchers' analysis of extensive genetic data revealed that eyes originated at least eight times in cnidarians, and the morphological differences within this group align with each new origin. Their findings are compiled in the paper, ""Prolific Origination of Eyes in Cnidaria with Co-option of Non-visual Opsins,""ù which appears in the scientific journal Current Biology.  Natasha Picciani, a graduate student in UCSB's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, was the lead author on this paper. According to Picciani, mapping the eye origins in cnidarians required access to an expansive phylogeny that illustrated the vast lineages in the cnidarian tree of life. However, at the time of this research, no such phylogeny existed; therefore, the biologists had to create one.  ""We turned to GenBank, which is one of the biggest repositories of DNA sequences that are available,""ù says Picciani. ""We had to select data from everything that was available to build a large phylogeny ""¶ so that we could have enough diversity of species to inform us about the eye origins that occured within the group.""ù She adds that the contributions of undergraduate students at UCSB were instrumental in the analysis of the large data set.  The resulting phylogeny contained 1,102 species and displayed a large diversity of lineages, which allowed the researchers to better understand the relationships between varying eye types and origins in cnidarians.  The phylogeny revealed that different cnidarian eye types have different origins, meaning that they evolved separately and are not part of a single line of evolution. Picciani refers to this as a ""surprising find""ù because prior to her research, these variations in eye type origin were largely unknown. The findings of this research demonstrate the reach of evolutionary processes, especially those related to convergent evolution, which creates analogous structures that don't share a common ancestor but have similar forms or functions.  Moving forward, Picciani hopes that the comprehensive phylogeny created by her team will inspire further research into the evolution of eyes in cnidarians.  ""Eye evolution in cnidarians has not been very well appreciated,""ù she says. ""The idea that eyes evolved separately has been previously proposed, but it had not been tested with new technologies.""ù  According to Picciani, cnidarians can be extremely useful in studying the processes of evolution.  ""Cnidarians are much simpler than other invertebrates,""ù notes Picciani. ""So they can be a great system for comparison because they are easy to cultivate in the lab. This allows us to study visual systems and evolution of complex traits in a much easier way.""ù Picciani believes this paper will allow for more informed comparisons and more specific studies addressing development and gene expression, which will ultimately lead to a greater understanding of evolution.

science,UCSB Researchers Work Toward Agricultural Carbon Solution,24-Aug-18,8:00 PM,['Natalie Overton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-researchers-work-toward-agricultural-carbon-solution/,"Here's a fun mental exercise: suppose you've got a plot of land in its original, untouched state. Assume you're a farmer and you need to grow some crops, but you're also environmentally conscious and want to do your part in decreasing the escape of CO2 into the atmosphere. The problem is that in order to clear land for your crops, you destroy forest area and all of the carbon that was sequestered (stored) safely inside the roots and leaves of the forest's first inhabitants is now released into the atmosphere.  Given that some extent of destruction is inevitable, the eco-friendly agriculturalist turns to the sort of crops that will come next. Some crops conserve carbon more than others, but they're also lower yield, so you need more land to grow more food. It's an algorithm of sorts: maximize the yield while minimizing carbon loss to the atmosphere. How would you proceed? David Williams, a conservation scientist and postdoctoral scholar at UCSB's Bren Hall, has spent years researching an optimal solution. During his time in three different world regions, Williams and his team conducted field research exploring the complexities of the aforementioned puzzle.  They found that regardless of the region, whether it be humid forests of Ghana, temperate Polish wetlands or dry areas of Mexico, the land-sparing option comes out on top. By preserving as much of the forest as possible, this technique uses the remaining land to do high-yield agriculture. This maintains biodiversity and contributes the least carbon to the atmosphere while allowing for a comparable level of food production. We've been doing about half that equation right so far. Worldwide over the past eight years, the global community has funneled $777 billion into agriculture and forestry development. That's the funding that helps farmers up their yield. This makes no commitment to high-yield's counterpart, land-sparing (which must include some kind of conservation). Forest conservation only gets around $20 billion a year. This is an important distinction. Some kinds of agriculture are dubbed ""potentially land-sparing,""ù simply because they're so high-yield. There are plenty of those systems. The rarer ones, the real gems here, use ""strategies that have explicitly linked high yields with a land-sparing approach,""ù according to Williams. The statistics above speak volumes about where global interest, and subsequently the globe's money, goes. ""Unless this changes,""ù Williams continued, ""we're unlikely to make meaningful progress toward lower-carbon agriculture.""ù There's still hope, though: There are a few places throughout the world that have employed land-sparing and high-yield agriculture techniques. Women farm in cornfields in Ghana. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons According to a policy paper published a few years ago by Ben Phalan, Costa Rica has cracked down on their land zoning, and this forces higher yield in an interesting way. When regulators zone only some land as okay for agriculture, farmers have a limited space (but the market doesn't care), so they find higher yield methods to get a comparable harvest using less land. In this sense, stricter agricultural expansion laws could spell success. Related to this method is another policy mechanism that makes use of environmental instruments, as Williams put it. ""These could be land taxes, payments or subsidies that either encourage yield increases or provide assistance to farmers, dependent on them not expanding agriculture,""ù he said.  For example, Williams referenced several programs across the globe, including in an area of Northern India called Spiti, where the government has provided assistance to prevent snow leopard predation of farmers' flocks in return for the farmers agreeing to designate some spots as conservation areas. For this region, this works. Fewer of farmers' flock are picked off by the local predatory cats, so their business becomes higher-yield while practicing land-sparing. While successful techniques have proven highly contextual, one thing remains the same across all the regions Williams and his team studied. The carbon loss difference between small- and large-scale farming is tiny compared to that between untouched land and agriculture of any kind. This doesn't mean that you should give up hope at your local farmer's market, but rather this just puts the issue into perspective. Converting forest to farmland is detrimental to the Earth in a big way and isn't something that can be solved by buying only organic produce or only produce sold from under a tent. The two most accessible ways to broach both the political and social aspects of the web of issues that underlie the puzzle of agricultural and conservation, Williams agreed, is to vote and have conversations. The best path depends on the culture and politics of each area, so naturally, some mechanisms will be policy-based while others will rely on social change. Whatever the path we choose to pave for ourselves, however, Williams and his team have set up a beacon. We know where we're going, and we've got the freedom to decide how we'll get there.
Print Not all ""high yield""ù practices are good for the environment/biodiversity/carbon sequestration (etc).  As a matter of fact, most aren't good for them at all.  So the $777 billion or whatever is likely counterproductive (as it were).  High yield practices are usually only so in the short-to-medium term; long term, they are quite damaging.

These wrinkles are extremely beneficial to us, as it creates more surface area for our neurons to carry information and to continue making vital connections. They start forming during embryonic development and continue until the day we die.  This process of how exactly our brain wrinkles is studied by Eyal Karzbrun, a KITP postdoctoral scholar working in UCSB's Streichan Lab. Karzbrun's research involves using 3D cultures of stem cells to study brain development and the physical constraints that may alter the shape of brain tissue.  As stated by Karzbrun, ""The brain is a complex organ whose organization is essential to its function. Yet it is ""òassembled by itself'. How this assembly takes place and what physics come into play is fundamental to our understanding of the brain.""ù  He goes on to explain that when we are born, our neurons take their correct positions, causing the brain to start wrinkling before we exit the womb, and there are several different hypotheses as to why this is the case.  ""One of the main hypotheses is that the brain wrinkles due to a mechanical instability during growth, which is a purely physical phenomena,""ù Karzbrun said. This physical phenomena goes back to the 1700s, when Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician, discovered that a critical force will cause a straight and elastic material to fold into a wavy shape when it is compressed. Therefore, the same parallel can be drawn to our brain, as studies have shown that the outer part of the brain has a faster growth differential then the inner part. These different growth rates cause the tissue to fold, giving the brain its famous wrinkles.  Our brain is an impressive computing machine, and it holds its remarkable architecture due to these folds, or wrinkles. Karzbrun, who specializes in biophysics and synthetic biology, draws parallels between a brain and a computer, stating that layout of both are very similar.  ""The cerebral cortex, which occupies most of the volume in your brain, has a unique architecture in which neurons are layered on the outer surface of the brain, and the bulk of the brain is composed of axons, [or] biological wire which interconnect the neurons,""ù he said. Similarly, in a computer the computational elements are layered out on a surface.  In terms of the intersection between physics and neurobiology that is necessary when studying our brain's wrinkles, Karzbrun states that the first step should be to study living systems.  ""From mechanics of active materials, to emergence of patterns in large collective of small interacting agents, [it is important to study] what makes a network of neurons into a computing brain,""ù he said. These can help answer tough questions such as what determines the average lifespan of a human being versus a mouse.  At the end of the day, a vast majority of the brain's functions and structural reasoning is still unknown; however, thanks to the continuous research done by scientists such as Karzbrun, we are able to get a few steps closer.

science,Fishy Business: Wealthy Nations Overrepresent in Industrial Fishing,5-Sep-18,3:00 PM,['Simran Kaur'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-05/fishy-business-wealthy-nations-overrepresent-in-industrial-fishing/,"Seafood is a vital source of sustenance for a number of malnourished nations; however, new research shows that global waters are largely dominated by the industrial fishing fleets of wealthy countries, which may be contributing to global food insecurity.  A team of researchers at UC Santa Barbara tracked the patterns of industrial fishing vessels around the globe, and they found a significant disparity between the number of vessels belonging to lower-income and higher-income countries in both national and international waters. Their paper, ""Wealthy countries dominate industrial fishing,""ù appears in the journal Science Advances.  The researchers were able to track fishing vessels using advanced machine-learning technologies that allowed them to analyze large capacities of data.  In their paper, the researchers state, ""Describing fishing patterns in comprehensive and quantitative terms, both in national waters and on the high seas, is challenging due to the lack of open access to detailed records on the behavior of fishing vessels. However, advances in machine learning technologies and big data capacity now offer us access to high-resolution fishing vessel activity from 22 billion automatic identification systems (AIS) points, processed by the Global Fishing Watch platform using convolutional neural network models.""ù Their data revealed that 97 percent of trackable industrial fishing in international waters is carried out by vessels from higher-income countries. Additionally, vessels from higher-income nations are also responsible for 78 percent of the industrial fishing that occurs within the national waters of lower-income countries.  The dominance of wealthier countries in global industrial fishing can be highly detrimental for low-income countries that predominantly rely on seafood for nutritional sustenance. Venders sell their fish at a fish market in Japan, one of the higher-income countries with significant industrial fishing activity. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons According to the researchers, ""Guinea, a low-income nation that is heavily reliant nutritionally on seafood, presents an apt example. Approximately 75% of Guinea's population (an estimated 10.1 million people) may be vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies in future scenarios with reduced access to seafood, making it one of the most nutritionally vulnerable countries in the world to losses of seafood. In this analysis, we estimate that over 80% of the industrial fishing effort we detected in Guinea's EEZ came from China, a situation that presents potential challenges.""ù The unequal distribution of power on global waters prompts discussions about food sovereignty, or the ""rights of local people to control their own food systems.""ù Scientists who are concerned about this uneven control of marine resources sometimes refer to it as ""ocean grabbing""ù or ""marine colonialism,""ù arguing that wealthy countries unfairly exercise control over the resources of vulnerable, less-wealthy nations.  The research team behind this paper hopes that their findings will influence future policy decisions regarding marine resources. Moreover, they hope to influence a marine biodiversity treaty that it currently being drafted by the United Nations.  The paper states, ""Analyzing and communicating patterns of the distribution of fishing effort by different nations on the high seas are especially timely and important given the immediate opportunity to use these data to shape progress toward a United Nations treaty being developed for biodiversity on the high seas.""ù The findings of these researchers reveal great inequalities among higher-income and lower-income nations in terms of global industrial fishing, and they may have the power to influence political change that creates more equitable global waters. 
Print >The dominance of wealthier countries in global industrial fishing can be highly detrimental for low-income countries that predominantly rely on seafood for nutritional sustenance. You make this claim yet provide no evidence to support it. Are you trying to say that the water around low income countries are over-fished to the point that local fisherman can not fish enough to meet the countries needs? How are the fisherman from low-income countries being negatively effected?

But that alone won't help scientists gather the data they need to facilitate the critically-endangered species' recovery.  What could help, according to associate professor Douglas McCauley of UC Santa Barbara's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, is a first of its kind social network for fish. McCauley is director of the Benioff Ocean Initiative, which designed and funded the ""Spotting Giant Sea Bass""ù website.  The project relies on citizen scientists who upload pictures of the fish in the wild and a powerful algorithm that accurately identifies individuals. The program identifies unique individuals by their ""living barcode""ù spot patterns using a repurposed algorithm originally designed to identify star patterns in constellations and later used to track zebra stripes in Kenya.  Over 100 unique individuals have been identified since the launch of this project on July 26, a huge portion of a population roughly estimated in a genetic study to be as small as 500 breeding individuals.  ""We say there's plenty of fish in the sea,""ù McCauley said. ""500 is not plenty.""ù For an animal so critically endangered and ""so big you could stick your head in it""ù, we know surprisingly little about the giant sea bass. McCauley hopes this project can fill in the missing gaps in the data.  The project maps individuals' locations and sighting times, valuable data that helps scientists determine key population metrics, like the number of fish that use protected areas regularly, where they mate and how far they travel. These data are the building blocks for an intelligent population management strategy, according to McCauley. A giant sea bass swims by a diver. / Courtesy of Douglas McCauley Knowing where and when the fish are spotted helps scientists determine how well protected areas are servicing the fish; California has a good network of ""underwater parks""ù, but it isn't known how much the species uses these areas or if they frequent and breed in places outside of them. The data from ""Spotting Giant Sea Bass""ù could be used to confirm their use of these areas or even establish new protected areas for the species based on a more complete picture of their use of space.  McCauley spotted a fish in a protected area that the social-network-like program matched with a photo taken there seven years earlier by somebody he never met.  ""To learn that such a small protected area actually served as a meaningful refuge for a fish that keeps coming there year after year and has kept coming back there for at least seven years is pretty useful information to think about design strategy for protection,""ù he said. Highly sought after by divers for their unique combination of size and curiosity, the giant sea bass's charisma translates into real economic value ""î value that may help further the species' recovery, according to McCauley. A previous UCSB study valued a living fish's ecotourism potential at approximately $2.3 million, compared to a mere $12,600 value for a dead one sold in fish markets.  ""For [ecotourism] businesses in Santa Barbara and Ventura, this is their lion or elephant, and the bush is their backyard,""ù McCauley said. McCauley hopes this ecotourism value will attract more citizen scientists to contribute to the project.  ""You've got this giant staring back at you and welcoming you to the ocean . . . There's something special about being with a fish that's twice as old as you, bigger than you and curious of your presence on the reef,""ù said McCauley. ""There's a real sense of loss of not having more of them around.""ù

science,UCSB Researcher Works toward Island Restoration,20-Sep-18,3:00 PM,['Ruth Sanchez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/ucsb-researcher-works-toward-island-restoration/,"Palmyra Atoll / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons A single invasive species can cause catastrophic change to an ecosystem. When an entire ecosystem is affected by the intruding species, what can be done to reverse or ameliorate the negative effects? Understanding how to effectively restore an ecosystem after it has been altered by an invasive species is one component of UC Santa Barbara researcher Hillary Young's work.  Young's research began in 2006 on the island of Palmyra Atoll, where she set out to study how the ecosystem functions. Her initial goal was to collect data about the plants and animals present on the island. What came as a surprise during her research was the great amount of rat species that inhabited Palmyra. The rat population was most likely brought to the island by soldiers during World War II. Without any predators, the rodent species had been able to quickly increase in number and was considered a prime factor for the steady drop of the seabirds on the island.  In 2011, The Nature Conservancy, an environmental organization, partnered with Island Conservation and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to initiate an eradication of the rats at Palmyra in an attempt to protect the dying number of seabirds.† Young had other interests with the eradication; she saw it as an opportunity to understand the impact that the rat eradication had on the island's plant community. ""We were lucky to have pre-imposed data, as it was a huge asset for the study,""ù Young noted. † The post-eradication data was compared by Island Conservation biologist and†lead researcher for the study, Coral Wolf, to the pre-eradication data Young collected†to outline the effect of the conservation intervention. What Young, Wolf, and their research team discovered was published in the journal PLOS One in an article titled ""Invasive rat eradication strongly impacts plant recruitment on a tropical atoll""ù. Removal of the rats allowed for a vast increase in native plants that were integral to the island; seedling recruitment was observed to grow in count for nearly all of the native trees examined. With the eradication of the rats also came the beneficial eradication of the disease-carrying tiger mosquito. However, post-eradication data showed a notable increase in the Cocos nucifera, an invasive plant that was in relatively low numbers in the island's pre-eradication state. An increase of the invasive species Cocos nucifera, the coconut palm, occurred after the eradication of rats on the island. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons ""What happens is something called alternative stable states, which shows that restoring a species doesn't just flip the system back to what it was before. It's going to be different,""ù Young explained. The theory Young refers to is an ecosystem's ability to shift from one stable state to another. Despite the increase of the Cocos nucifera on the island, the growth of the native plant species anticipates benefits for the plants and animals dependent on them, according to the PLOS One article. † Although there is risk involved with the eradication of invasive species, researchers are becoming more accustomed to managing specific target species to ensure beneficial results. ""It's a story of optimism and caution,""ù said Young in regard to the eradication processes. She finds that whole system responses are the ones that are more difficult to predict and warrant more study. ""It's really valuable to try to understand how whole systems respond because we don't want surprise effects,""ù Young said. ""Yes, we can now eradicate rats to protect seabirds, but what we really want to do is protect all the species on the island and the native ecosystem functioning.""ù At Palmyra Atoll, Young is continuing her study of whole food webs and how they operate. ""We're building food webs for each of the Palmyra islands and are trying to understand how the whole system responds rather than one particular taxa ""î rather than just focusing on plants or mosquitos or on a single species approach,""ù said Young.

But these methods are only as good as their ability to bypass cells' trash disposal mechanism, which evolved as a self-defense method to break down harmful foreign proteins, pathogens or damaged cellular structures. Enter an innovative new method of infrared light-triggered genome editing that can efficiently bypass this trash disposal mechanism. It is estimated to be 100 to 100,000 times more efficient than current methods. This unique method of genome editing gives scientists complete control over when and where genetic material is delivered to cells, allowing for detailed study of genetic changes at different points in a cell's life cycle. For the first time, scientists can precisely target individual cells for genomic editing. This powerful ability could allow each cell to become its own experiment. ""We are the first method to target individual cells for genome editing but it is the first to have the ability to deliver proteins for individual cell genome editing. We can choose an individual cell amongst a population and release a protein,""ù Erin Morgan, co-author of the study, said. ""Other technologies affect the whole cell population.""ù The study's authors used a combination of gold nanospheres, essentially tiny gold particles, and infrared laser light to achieve such concentrated results. Genetic material is attached to the gold particles along with special peptides that act as ""keys,""ù allowing the genetic material access into the cell, Morgan said. Once inside, the cell's trash disposal mechanism kicks in, entrapping the gold particles in an endosome and blocking the release of their genetic material.
""This is a problem for a lot of delivery methods; the material gets stuck in the endosomes and never gets out,""ù said Morgan. ""With our technology, the near-infrared light allows for the release of the cargo and protein from the endosome.""ù The gold nanospheres are specially tuned to act as a homing beacon for the microscope-targeted laser, which ""excites""ù the nanoparticles on the surface of the gold and creates tiny bubbles that burst the endosome, causing it to free the genetic material for editing, Morgan explained. The microscope-targeted laser, which is entirely harmless to human and animal cells, allows for real-time monitoring of cellular changes and can be aimed at any cell at any time. The innovative method of delivering gene editing enzymes uses light-activation, such as by laser irradiation. / Courtesy of Erin Morgan ""Even if our particles are internalized, whatever's on the surface will not be effective until we hit them with the laser,""ù Morgan said. ""That's really what allows for the spatial and temporal control.""ù Because of its extreme precision and efficiency, this technology could be used for any number of cutting-edge gene therapies in the future. The technology uses the CRE enzyme like a pair of scissors to cut DNA that scientists want to remove and reinsert pieces they want to replace it with. Morgan is now working to use the Cas9 enzyme and other gene-editing technologies with the gold and infrared light method. ""The field is constantly evolving,""ù Morgan said. ""We're trying to deliver different proteins and create a new technology for other scientists to use in order to continue their studies.""ù Research on this project was conducted also by lead author Norbert Reich and co-authors Megan McAdams and Amanda B.

science,UCSB Researcher Studies Possibility of Greater Wildfire Frequency in Future,4-Oct-18,8:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/ucsb-researcher-studies-possibility-of-greater-wildfire-frequency-in-future/,"A huge plume of smoke is seen in the distance in Mendocino County from the Mendocino Complex Fire in late July 2018. Consisting of two wildfires, the River and Ranch Fires, the complex fire burned a total of 460,000 acres, destroying 280 structures and resulting in one fatality before they were 100 percent contained on Sept. 18. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons California's wildfire season began earlier than usual in 2018, with the Mendocino Complex Fire burning nearly 460,000 acres total beginning in late July. It surpassed the Thomas Fire, which occurred during December of the previous year in Santa Barbara and Ventura, to become the largest recorded wildfire in California's history. With greater intensity and frequency in wildfires occurring in recent years, scientists at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management have partnered with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to study this concerning progression. Looking at trends in El Ni√±o ""î Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ""î a natural climate cycle that affects heat distribution, precipitation and winds on a worldwide-scale ""î the researchers are exploring how climate change affects ENSO and how, in turn, that impacts environmental events like wildfire frequency and heat waves. Their research appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. ENSO consists of the opposing phases of El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a. During El Ni√±o, trade winds push warm waters that eventually reach the eastern Pacific Ocean, resulting in warmer-than-average temperatures in that region. Its counterpart, La Ni√±a, generates below-average temperatures in the eastern Pacific. This climate phenomenon has far-reaching consequences, including creating droughts in some areas and causing flooding in others, affecting integral human processes including agriculture, fishing and fire and flood prevention. ""We still don't know how climate change will affect the overall strength of ENSO, since climate model projections are pretty much evenly split on whether it will strengthen or weaken in the future. But what we were able to show in this study is that models do agree on how wildfires will be impacted by El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a events of a given magnitude,""ù Samantha Stevenson, co-author and an assistant professor at UCSB, said. ""In other words, we may not know exactly how big future El Ni√±os and La Ni√±as may be, but we do know that their effects on wildfire will be amplified by climate change,""ù she said. Stevenson and her team used two climate model simulations, developed at NCAR and at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. They each described atmospheric, land and oceanic conditions at every point on Earth throughout the course of the 20th and late 21st centuries. With large ""ensembles""ù that had previously been run with each of these climate models beginning at nearly identical initial climate states, the models were run numerous times over to see how random noise affected the behavior of the climate system. The two models ended up showing very different future behavior of ENSO: one predicting future ENSO strengthening, the other predicting weakening. El Ni√±o conditions are shown and compared to normal conditions. El Ni√±o, which is sometimes referred to as the warm phase of ENSO, lasts nine to 12 months on average, but can last longer. Such events occur roughly every two to seven years, which can have global-scale impacts. / Courtesy of NOAA What the scientists concluded is that future El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a events will bring proportionally stronger changes to the risk of wildfire in fire-prone places. Based on the climate models, climate warming may enhance the impacts of ENSO. This may create a higher probability and severity of regional temperature extremes, and, consequently, increased related impacts such as wildfire frequency. ""In Southern California, La Ni√±a events tend to favor warmer and drier conditions, [which are] more conducive to wildfire,""ù Stevenson explained. ""What our study indicates is that even if La Ni√±as themselves behave exactly the same way in the future, Southern California wildfires will still become more likely during La Ni√±a years. That happens because the land surface is gradually warming due to human-induced CO2 emissions. So when La Ni√±a comes along and adds even more heat and dries things out even more, that's being added to a hotter and drier background that makes wildfires easier to start.""ù Despite figuring out that the impacts of ENSO will intensify, the scientists still need to understand how ENSO will behave in the future to be able to estimate the total risk of future wildfire. Stevenson stresses the importance of working with many different climate models, which ""can give us information that's quite useful for planning, even if we don't have all the answers yet.""ù ""Our study really highlights the need to be prepared, and to keep working on improving strategies for dealing with extreme events. We know that climate variability will continue into the future; ENSO is a natural feature of the climate and isn't going anywhere. Since the impacts of that climate variability are likely to become stronger in the future, we need to keep that in mind when developing future firefighting plans,""ù Stevenson said. This study was also conducted by lead author John Fasullo and co-author Bette Otto-Bliesner, both scientists at NCAR.

Additional collaborators include physicians and scientists at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. The study, ""Smartphone-based pathogen diagnosis in urinary sepsis patients,""ù can be found in the EbioMedicine journal, and the research was funded by grants from the National Institute of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The smartphone-based, real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification ""î or smaRT-LAMP ""î is a clinically valuable system that can help speed up the diagnostic process for urinary tract infections (UTIs). ""There are 10 million urinary tract infections in the U.S. per year, mostly in women,""ù Mahan said in an email. To put things into perspective, roughly half of UTIs are properly diagnosed. UTIs can lead to many complications, such as a higher risk of miscarriages in pregnant women. A significant statistic revealed that half of all women will develop a urinary tract infection in their lifetimes, and UTIs account for 25 percent of all sepsis cases. Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and a major cause of death, which emphasizes the importance of proper diagnostic tools. Although diagnostics influence roughly 70 percent of healthcare spending, only 3-5 percent of these spendings actually fund diagnostics. As a result, the World Health Organization has been encouraging inexpensive and effective diagnostic tools to use in areas with limited resources. UTIs can be painful if limited to the bladder but deadly if spread to the kidney. These infections are usually treated with antibiotics, in which early stage diagnosis is necessary in the context of antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant pathogens. ""The high cost of current technologies to identify (ID) bacteria in the urine preclude their use in resource-limited settings like local clinics,""ù said Mahan in an email. ""SmaRT-LAMP provides a portable, accurate and low-cost detection system for the medically underserved.""ù This reusable kit costs less than $100 to assemble and can produce useful information in one hour, compared to 18-28 hours in a microbiology lab. Upon urine sample collection, clinical microbiology labs have to grow the bacteria in cultures first. In the new and simplified process, the smartphone app will analyze a small amount of the urine sample using the phone's camera and the diagnostic kit. The smartphone app analyzes a small amount of the patient's urine sample and can detect the pathogen's I.D. and colony count. The Bacticount app is open-source, free and currently available for Android phones from the Google Play store. / Courtesy Image ""The phone's camera takes pictures of a fluorescent chemical reaction that detects the presence of bacterial DNA,""ù Mahan said in an email. ""The more fluorescence, the more bacteria.""ù The smaRT-LAMP system is based on nucleic acid detection: It amplifies DNA, forming pyrophosphates in the process. This causes turbidity that can be visualized more effectively than with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). SmaRT-LAMP does not require complex equipment or skilled staff, so it is cost- and resource-effective. The free app is currently made for the Android-based operating system and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. Mahan said that the immediate focus is to integrate the app into local clinical practice, but he also anticipates adoption by international health organizations. ""In the future, we plan to modify the system to detect bacteria in the blood,""ù Mahan said in an email. By branching out this procedure to work on a variety of pathogens and patient samples, the smaRT-LAMP system's clinical versatility will surely speed diagnoses and encourage effective therapies.

science,UCSB Researcher ReFINes Method to Detect Sharks,18-Oct-18,8:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/ucsb-researcher-refines-method-to-detect-sharks/,"White sharks tend to stay in shallower waters close by the shore, including near Southern California beaches, but have been spotted swimming in open waters at depths of up to 3,900 feet. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have made developments for a relatively new technique to track sharks with a sample of water. Specifically, they set out to create a more sensitive surveillance assessment specific to white sharks. They have done so using environmental DNA (eDNA), or genetic material collected from the environment, rather than directly from an organism. ""eDNA has been used for several years to track invasive freshwater species like the Asian carp and bullfrog. People are now starting to use it in the ocean,""ù Kevin Lafferty, a marine ecologist of the U.S. Geological Survey and UCSB's Marine Science Institute, said. With a new and more sensitive eDNA technique developed by Lafferty's UCSB colleague Christopher Jerde, the tracking of many white sharks in Carpinteria by CSU Long Beach's Christopher Lowe and the help of researchers from Central Michigan University, Lafferty said they decided to ""give it a go.""ù ""We wanted to see if we could detect white sharks from a water sample using eDNA,""ù he said. Their research, ""Detecting southern California's white sharks with environmental DNA,""ù of which Lafferty is lead author, appears in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. Using eDNA provides an alternate technique to monitor sharks, in contrast to the more common approaches of tagging or direct observation. Most sharks are untagged, and poor observation conditions or infrequent sightings of white sharks can hinder adequate surveillance of white sharks by drones or aircraft. ""eDNA works even when the water is not clear and you don't have to catch the shark to track it. It should work with any species that sheds DNA into the water and has a unique DNA code (which is pretty much any ocean plant or animal),""ù Lafferty said. When animals swim, they slough off skin and mucus that contain their genetic information. The DNA remains in the environment as a ""genetic plume""ù even as the material breaks down over time and can be extracted by filtering the water. Using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to copy the genetic information millions of times, the DNA can then easily be sequenced and read, informing the researchers what species have been in the area. ""For our study, we used a technique called digital droplet PCR, which isolates each individual piece of DNA. This is helpful when the DNA you are looking for is really rare,""ù Lafferty said. Lafferty and his colleagues detected white shark DNA at the site in Carpinteria where the sharks had aggregated and did not find it a mile up the coast, where there had been no reported sharks, confirming they could use eDNA to detect white sharks. The figure shows sites near Carpinteria, Calif., where Lafferty and his colleagues tested whether they could accurately detect white shark eDNA. They tagged six juvenile white sharks with external acoustic transmitters at Padaro Lane and deployed two acoustic receivers as part of a long-term monitoring program. The inset figure shows the times and dates when three tagged juvenile white sharks were detected at the Santa Claus 2 acoustic receiver location. / Courtesy of Kevin Lafferty Presently, white shark populations are increasing after having been placed under protection decades ago due to overfishing. Southern California beaches serve as nursery habitat for juvenile white sharks, especially during the summer and fall period, so shark interactions with beachgoers may become more frequent. Although the chances of a shark bite are slim, sometimes the creatures may mistake a human for their usual prey ""î including seals and stingrays ""î or otherwise be provoked. Therefore, eDNA could play a part in informing public safety and conservation planning. ""We might one day be able to assess whether there have been white sharks swimming at your local beach, giving you the choice to stay out of the water and avoid a conflict with a shark,""ù Lafferty said. He hopes to expand the usage of the method to begin monitoring when and where sharks swim in Southern California. As white shark populations recover, eDNA could help with mapping white shark distributions and non-invasive tracking for fishery coastal assays. ""Humans worry about white sharks, but the animal that seems most at risk to them is the southern sea otter,""ù Lafferty said. ""Most otter deaths are now attributed to shark bites.

science,English in the Field: Conducting Interdisciplinary Research,25-Oct-18,8:30 AM,['Sunidhi Sridhar'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/english-in-the-field-conducting-interdisciplinary-research/,"Justine Bethel, an English major, presents the interdisciplinary work she had been working on this past summer as part of a collaborative project between CCBER and the Department of English. Her ""cli-fi""ù (climate fiction) project focuses on thinking about California in the aftermath of an ecological disaster. Daniel Kong / Daily Nexus Field research is often associated with scientific disciplines, but for several weeks this past summer, six English majors drew inspiration from the natural environment for their writing. In collaboration with the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER), these interns developed a creative writing or research project that included an element of ecology, whether that be specimen preservation or global climate change. Dr. Melody Jue, an assistant professor of English at UCSB, described these projects as ""a joy to supervise, because this kind of internship self-selects for very motivated and driven students who are just really passionate to follow their own curiosity.""ù Over the course of six weeks, the interns were required to devote 60 hours to their own writing and, at CCBER, to keep a journal and meet with their graduate mentors once a week. Aili Pettersson Peeker and Anita Raychawdhuri, both second-year doctoral candidates, mentored the undergraduates and were instrumental in the success of their projects. This quarter, the undergraduate interns were given the opportunity to present their findings in front of faculty, students and prospective applicants. Jack Kassebaum, a fourth-year English major, explored the theme of the three butterflies ""î†Polyommatus icarus, Lycaeides melissa samuelis and Vanessa atalanta ""î present in Russian novelist Vladimir Nabokov's works. This experience was Kassebaum's first time working with CCBER. ""I understand that as writers, we get a bad reputation of sitting behind a desk and reading all day,""ù he admitted, ""but for this internship, we actually did get to go out.""ù His first assignment was to go out into the field and catch a butterfly, and over the summer he familiarized himself with data sheets, collected specimens and catalogued them in the database. Kassebaum's primary objective was to develop a stronger connection with Nabokov both as a person and as a fellow writer. An undergraduate student details his exploration of digital poetics inspired by Cheadle Center field work for ecological restoration on Oct. 12, 2018. Daniel Kong/ Daily Nexus Victoria Penate, who is also a fourth-year English major, reflected on how she initially struggled to decide in which direction she wanted to take her project because she is usually most comfortable when writing about people. During the informational meeting, the name Katherine Esau was mentioned ""almost in passing,""ù and as Penate looked into her life and career, she realized that this was someone she wanted to learn more about. Esau was a German-American botanist who received her doctorate at UC Davis. She moved to UCSB in 1965, where she did what she herself describes as her ""favorite, most productive work.""ù Esau led a distinguished life; she published several botanical textbooks and was awarded a National Medal of Science in 1989. Penate found it important to note that Esau's grand accomplishments as a scientist and a woman were achievable through her day-to-day work and personal life. To conclude her presentation, Penate acknowledged that ""it is probably impossible to bring light to every single person who has done important research and who deserves to have their story spotlighted, but it is still important to dig deep into those personal histories because there is a lot we can learn from those who came before us.""ù Sponsored by the Arnhold Collaborative Research Grant, the internship program was introduced this year. Any English major or minor who is interested in interning for CCBER for a quarter is welcome to apply, as well as any graduate students who are interested in mentoring interns.

science,Exploring How Team Dynamics Affect Team Performance,1-Nov-18,8:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/exploring-how-team-dynamics-affect-team-performance/,"(L-R, clockwise): Teamwork has becoming increasingly common in nearly all professions and fields, such as for Marine Corp recruits on a challenging hike, a surgical team performing a surgical procedure, scientists in the field working together to collect entomological material and Ministry of Defense civilian and military staff discussing issues in a meeting. Team composition and dynamics can be used to predict team performance. / Photos Credit: Wikimedia Commons As knowledge work becomes more complex, organizations increasingly assign tasks to teams rather than individuals. Working in teams has become more common in the modern workplace, whether it's at the office, in the lab or field or at school. Questions then naturally arise, including what factors define team performance and how team performance can be best predicted for a specific task. Previous research on teams has largely focused on team composition and its relationship with performance ""î for example, how the skills, personality and expertise of each individual affect the overall team's performance. Recognizing the need for research on the team itself in terms of team dynamics or the process of team behavior, researchers at UC Santa Barbara investigated the dynamics of team collaboration and how they predict team performance. ""When we included these team dynamics features, the model for predicting team performance was much stronger and more reliable than just including the team composition features overall,""ù Young Ji Kim, a communication assistant professor at UCSB, said. ""In fact, we found that the role of dynamics of team collaboration predicts the team performance more [accurately] than team compositional features alone.""ù Published in the journal PLoS ONE, the study ""Dynamics of collective performance in collaboration networks""ù featured a collaboration between Kim, computer science Ph.D. students and professors at UCSB and a management professor from MIT. Funded by the Army Research Office, they analyzed how the connections between team members and how they communicated with each other related to the quality of team output. The primary data the authors analyzed used the Platform for Online Group Studies (POGS) for data collection. Participants were randomly assigned to a team and completed various tasks over the course of an hour. The researchers then measured team performance by scoring how well the teams had completed each task. In teams of four or five, members communicated with each other through a text chat feature which showed senders and timestamps of messages. The scientists used the chat data to analyze the network of team communication. With data from a study done in 2014, Kim and her team replicated previous findings indicating that team composition impacts team performance. When creating a team, Kim stated, ensuring a high average level of social perceptiveness will foster team collaboration and productivity. ""When a team was composed of individuals who were highly socially perceptive, on average, the team performed well on the cognitive tests that we have given. Being socially perceptive means that you are able to accurately infer other people's mental and emotional states, so you're aware of other people's feelings and you know what other people are thinking,""ù she said. The researchers also noted that the ratio of females on a team mattered, with more women on a team linked to higher team performance. Kim and her colleagues next analyzed the data with greater focus on the dynamics of team behavior to understand their effect on team performance. ""We learned that a high performing team actually starts performing well on the first task,""ù Kim said. ""So instead of improving over time, the group members will actually start pretty well in the beginning. They were highly performing on the first test, and then they keep doing well over multiple tasks.""ù Another finding was that the more connected the communication network was, the higher the team performance. ""We constructed networks based on people's response patterns. If you respond to me, then there is a tie created between you and I, and so we construct a network in this way. When the network is more dense ""î meaning that everyone is connected to each other within the team and not just one person is always responding to another person, in particular ""î and that density is uniformly distributed ""î meaning that it's not centralized to one person and everyone in the team participates in responding to other people's messages ""î then the team performance is higher,""ù Kim said. Certain factors of teams, such as a high average level of social perceptiveness and a more connected communication network with evenly distributed connections, are linked to higher team performance. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons From the study's results, the scientists recommend that team managements generate teams with a high level of social perceptiveness for ""good grounds for positive team interactions.""ù In terms of team dynamics, team members should communicate ""frequently and vibrantly""ù and with as many people as possible on the team so that connections are more evenly distributed amongst each member, according to Kim. ""For example, students are working on study projects for their classes. It's often the case that a few people take leadership and then talk to some other people that they favor or work well with together. And that seems easy. But that doesn't necessarily lead to a good performance in the team. You need to try to include everyone in the team and try to communicate a lot and in roughly equal amounts with other people in the team. We should be a little more democratic and decentralized,""ù she said. One point Kim emphasized was how this study allowed her to participate in interdisciplinary collaboration between communication, management and computer science, and for each discipline to learn from one another. ""We often stress the importance of this kind of interdisciplinary collaboration because it's supposed to generate newer and more exciting knowledge, but in reality, it's hard to actually combine efforts from different disciplines,""ù Kim said. ""But with our efforts and some funding help, we were able to do this. And it was a great experience. I learned a lot from computer science colleagues, and then they learned something from our social scientific insight and theory. I hope that more research is done that combines knowledge from different areas and different disciplines. I think this [study] was a good example of that kind of effort.""ù

science,UCSB Researcher Studies Optimization of Wind Farm Performance,8-Nov-18,8:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/ucsb-researcher-studies-optimization-of-wind-farm-performance/,"Luzzatto-Fegiz and Caulfield's theoretical model portrays the turbines on a wind farm to control the greatest amount of air possible in order to determine the maximal performance, or upper limit, for a wind turbine on a wind farm. Based on their model, they found that the performance could improve by ten-fold compared to the productivity of existing wind farms. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons As pressure mounts to find and use cleaner sources of energy, harnessing wind power has become increasingly common. But while wind turbines may be a large prospective source for generating electricity, these immense devices aren't living up to their full potential. That is, at least, according to the research conducted by Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz, a mechanical engineering assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, and Colm-cille Caulfield of the University of Cambridge. Their study, ""Entrainment model for fully-developed wind farms: Effects of atmospheric stability and an ideal limit for wind farm performance,""ù appears in the journal Physical Review Fluids. While the performance limits for a single wind turbine have been established, the same couldn't be said of the power output from a large wind farm before their research. And with large groups of wind turbines being utilized by the hundreds or thousands, understanding how the collective qualities of the group affect wind farm performance becomes more crucial. ""We are interested in trying to develop ultimately better wind farms, and part of that is to understand what would make for a better wind farm and how do we even define that. Right now, we optimize wind turbines so that they are really good in isolation, but that's not how we use them,""ù Luzzatto-Fegiz, lead author on the paper, said. As air approaches a rotating turbine, the spinning motion creates turbulence and slows down the air, depleting the air flow around it for neighboring turbines. This creates pockets of air on a big wind farm, in which only the turbines situated in the direct path of the wind can maximally benefit from the high-wind velocity for higher energy production. ""In that kind of situation, you have this wind shadow. Behind a wind turbine, the wind has been weakened because a lot of that energy has been extracted by that turbine. And so for the following turbines, that's a problem. Usually it diminishes how much power they can extract. So this suggests that you don't want to optimize the turbines by themselves; you want to optimize some property of the group,""ù Luzzatto-Fegiz said. The wind shadow effect can be seen in foggy conditions at an offshore wind farm. The wakes of lower-speed air created behind the first line of wind turbines lower the possible wind power production of a turbine and reduce optimization of wind farm performance. / Courtesy of Energy Journal Luzzatto-Fegiz and Caulfield have come up with an equation to calculate the optimal power density ""î that is, how much power is extracted per unit of land ""î for a large wind farm. The researchers' theoretical model isn't concerned with the look of the turbines or their spatial layout as much as it is focused on their possible productivity. The model displays how energy travels from higher up in the atmosphere down to an array of generic machines that take out energy. The researchers designed the devices to control the turbulence next to themselves so that they produce greater churning of the air. The mathematical model accounts for properties of the individual turbine ""î for example, how the angle of the blades can affect the flow of the air ""î as well the properties of the turbulence behind other wind turbines, such as the amount of mixing of the air, which relates to the physics of the flow. It provides an upper bound, or the maximal performance, for a wind turbine, determining the amount of room for improvement relative to the productivity of existing wind farms. ""You can ask, if I make a machine that does the best possible level of churning or mixing right next to the wind farm, how much could you improve things? And the surprising thing is that the [potential] improvement is a factor of 10,""ù Luzzatto-Fegiz said. Further, the model shows the role local weather plays on turbulence and power output. When solar radiation heats the ground during the day, it heats the surrounding layer of air, causing the warmed air to rise. This creates extra turbulence. At night, the opposite events occur. The ground can cool down quickly, causing an inversion, or a layer of cold air near the ground. That diminishes the mixing of air and subsequently makes it more difficult to extract power from a wind farm. ""The main idea is that we should think about the turbulence each wind turbine makes behind itself,""ù Luzzatto-Fegiz said. ""You might have multiple turbines designed in a complementary way to make turbulence together. You might take into account this effect of local weather, or what we call atmospheric stability, which is bottom heating or cooling.""ù The ultimate goal is to have the slow-moving air behind each turbine mixed with the faster moving air above the turbines as quickly as possible to allow subsequent turbines to harness the maximal amount of kinetic energy. Currently, wind turbines aren't designed to have this effect. ""We're looking at ways to modify existing turbines to improve our output by following assumptions and essentially having ways to enhance the turbulence each turbine makes. There is the upper bound, which we think is the most exciting thing from a scientific standpoint. It's more about a goal for engineers, for long-term research,""ù Luzzato-Fegiz said. ""It doesn't mean you can get there. But it suggests that there is room for growth.""ù

science,Improving Shark Sanctuaries,15-Nov-18,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/improving-shark-sanctuaries/,"Gray reef sharks are generally found in shallower waters near coral reefs, a declining habitat that makes them more susceptible to overfishing. Additionally, their low reproductive rate and the fact that they end up as bycatch in many fisheries have contributed to their ""Near Threatened""ù conservation status as determined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons UCSB researchers set out to understand shark movement in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), an island nation in the central Pacific Ocean consisting of hundreds of small atolls and islands. Instead, they discovered a high level of illegal shark fishing activity within the shark sanctuary. The researchers studied gray reef sharks, which are typically found near coral reefs. They tagged the sharks to track their locations via satellite, but soon realized the tags were moving in an unexpected way. ""It turns out we didn't really have the luxury of getting to explore our initial question ""¶ [we realized] our satellite tags weren't doing very sharky things. They weren't occasionally coming to the surface, they weren't sticking close to the reef,""ù Darcy Bradley, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute and Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, said. Rather, the scientists noticed that the sharks' movement was suspiciously linear, traveling nearly straight west across the Pacific Ocean. Some tags ended up as far as Guam and the Philippines. ""Very quickly it became clear that the tags were not on sharks. They were actually on boats,""ù Bradley said. This concerned the researchers, as they estimated that if the captured sharks were presumably killed, this rate of fishing mortality would cause even a healthy population to collapse in fewer than five years to less than 10 percent of its un-fished state. In response to high levels of illegal shark fishing activity, the RMI became one of the first countries to create sweeping legislation that protected sharks outright. The country declared its entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) ""î nearly two million square kilometers of ocean space ""î to be a shark sanctuary. In their study ""Leveraging satellite technology to create true shark sanctuaries,""ù published in the journal Conservation Letters, Bradley and her team outline how shark sanctuaries could enhance surveillance and enforcement. ""The idea of a shark sanctuary is it's not a marine protected area,""ù Bradley, lead author of the paper, said. Unlike a no-take marine protected area, which is closed to all fishing, a shark sanctuary is specific to sharks, she explained. Many shark sanctuaries are countries, such as Pacific Island nations and some Caribbean countries. ""Across the board, these areas ban the commercial fishing of sharks. So there's no actual shark fishery that can operate within that area. They also might ban the take of sharks at all,""ù Bradley said. Sharks are a high-value target species, making them susceptible to overfishing. ""Almost every part of a shark can be sold in a market ""î the liver has a fairly high value, the skin has a high value, the meat is something that's sold,""ù Bradley said. ""And then, really, the highest value part of the shark is its fins.""ù While the international shark fin trade has slowed down largely due to successful conservation efforts in the last decade, it is still an internationally active trade. Fins can fetch up to several hundred U.S. dollars per kilogram. And because of the vast size of the RMI EEZ, monitoring all ongoing activity can be difficult. Illegal shark fishing activity, such as that the researchers observed, can often slip by. Within the RMI exists one of the most active tuna fisheries in the world. Sharks end up as common bycatch, or an incidental catch, as part of commercial tuna fishing. Fishers are expected to comply with legislation by releasing their bycatch of sharks and having their fishing hauls checked at the RMI ports. ""We are assigning no value to that shark that's landed [in the RMI],""ù Bradley said. ""It's just trying to make the economic value of sharks be forced to zero because they are so economically valuable.""ù According to Bradley, several loopholes in shark sanctuary legislation may prevent full protection of sharks. Certain countries aren't required to land their catch in RMI ports. Artisanal fishers can catch sharks, allowing possible trade on a local scale to eventually sell up to commercial boats. ""There are enough of these types of loopholes that the legislation is not comprehensive,""ù Bradley said. ""There's still room to improve, we think, and it is still needed to really monitor more of the fishing activity happening within the zone because of these loopholes and because the legislation is not fully effective as of yet.""ù The researchers' recommendations to enhance the enforcement and monitoring within shark sanctuaries via satellite technologies include implementing vessel tracking systems, bannning vessels previously linked to illegal shark fishing from shark sanctuaries and working with international organizations and academia. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons In their paper, the researchers propose how the RMI can capitalize on several opportunities using existing vessel tracking technologies to strengthen their shark protection policy. One suggestion is for the fishery management organizations to build upon global treaties and international agreements, such as the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA). The PSMA aims to eliminate illegal fishing globally by prohibiting vessels previously linked to illegal fishing in shark sanctuaries from landing their catches and docking at ports. Banning these vessels could strengthen international repercussions for failing to comply with shark sanctuary legislation, according to Bradley. ""If a vessel was illegally fishing for sharks in a shark sanctuary, [we propose] it wouldn't just be given a fine from the Marshall Islands. That vessel would actually end up being listed internationally as a vessel that is engaged in illegal fishing, and that can be really problematic for that vessel in all other countries that are cosigned onto things like the PSMA,""ù she said. The study also recommends enforcement of a more robust vessel tracking system. Many vessels in the ocean carry a satellite tracking system called Automatic Identification System (AIS) that originated as a maritime safety device to avoid collisions on the high seas. More recently, it has become a tool to help researchers understand the landscape of fishing in global oceans. Launched by Google, Global Fishing Watch uses a machine learning approach to look at vessel tracking information. The program can detect not only where a vessel is but also what it's doing. This makes it an ""incredibly valuable tool,""ù Bradley said, as it will allow researchers like herself to be able to tease apart which vessels are fishing vessels and when fishing vessels are actively fishing as opposed to simply transiting between locations. ""We are proposing that certain fishery nations can look to opportunities to expand that tracking data ""î not just on the largest vessels but on all vessels operating within the sanctuary. Then they can really have a complete picture of what all the fishing vessels are doing in their sanctuary, where they are, when they're fishing, when they're not fishing and from that they can start to flag suspicious activities,""ù Bradley said. ""That bolsters our ability to know what's happening in the ocean, to have eyes on these really remote ocean faces.""ù She continued, ""We really applaud countries like the RMI that are prioritizing shark conservation, and we just wanted to point out in our paper that there are some really interesting opportunities using satellite technology to improve the enforcement of that legislation. We really are in an interesting time historically where there's so much technological innovation that we can use it to think creatively about how to close some of the loopholes and really leverage that type of innovation to help bolster enforcement and monitoring within shark sanctuaries.""ù

science,"UCSB Researchers Study Diet of Population With ‚""òWorld‚'s Healthiest Arteries‚'",29-Nov-18,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/ucsb-researchers-study-diet-of-population-with-worlds-healthiest-arteries/,"64 percent of the Tsiman√©'s daily calories come from complex carbohydrates high in fiber, including manioc root, plantains, maize and rice that they grow on family farms. / Courtesy of Michael Gurven Researchers have found that the Tsiman√© people of the Bolivian Amazon have the healthiest hearts in the world. With minimal levels of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, as well as the lowest levels of coronary artery disease ever recorded, the Tsiman√© population is a source of great interest for many reasons. ""The first question everyone wants to know is why do they not have heart disease? Is it magic genes, is it food, is it activity, is it social life, is it something else? So we're starting to analyze everything one at a time,""ù Michael Gurven, a UCSB professor of anthropology and senior author of the study, said. Along with postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the paper Thomas Kraft, Gurven is part of the Tsiman√© Health and Life History Project that began in 2002 to study the health, aging and behavior of the indigenous group. The researchers recently focused on understanding the diet of the heart-healthy Tsiman√©. Over a five-year period, they gathered data through multiple 24-hour dietary recalls for nearly 2,500 Tsiman√© people. They then compared the Tsiman√© diet to the typical American diet. Their study, ""Nutrition transition in 2 lowland Bolivian subsistence populations,""ù has been published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. ""We were looking at the population-level diet, but we were able to bring it down to the individual level to the extent that if I can look at what you specifically are eating, I can tell whether your eating patterns differ based on whether or not you have schooling, whether or not you live really close to town and the markets or if you live remote, really far away,""ù Gurven said. The Tsiman√© had a high daily caloric intake (2,422 for women and 2,736 for men), with their diet consisting of high levels of carbohydrates and proteins and low fat (64, 21 and 15 percent, respectively), compared to those of people in the U.S. Despite low dietary diversity, the Tsiman√© had an adequate macronutrient intake. While intake of dietary sodium, calcium and vitamins D, E and K was lower, intake of daily fiber and minerals linked to cardioprotective effects such as potassium, magnesium and selenium greatly exceeded that of Americans. One of the take-home messages is that the high-carbohydrate Tsiman√© diet may rebut paleo and Atkins-type diets that minimize carbohydrate intake with the belief that they will lead to a healthy heart. In fact, the Japanese Okinawan diet features an even higher carbohydrate level (85 percent) and Okinawans are some of the longest living people in the world, Gurven said. ""That's the thing about diet ""î some people study it formally, but everyone has strong ideas about it and about what one needs to eat or not eat in order to be healthy,""ù Gurven said. ""At least one thing we can do [with this study] is dispel certain kinds of myths.""ù Some straightforward aspects of the Tsiman√© diet include not eating processed food or drinking many sugary beverages, which make for low, refined sugar and refined carbohydrate intake. At the same time, the Tsiman√© consume meat (mostly fish) and numerous complex carbohydrates including plantains, corn, brown rice and sweet manioc in the form of beer. ""So those aspects of the diet and eating a lot of calories ""î the Tsiman√© eat more calories per day than we do even though they're probably two-thirds the size of an average American ""î isn't inconsistent or incompatible with having a healthy heart,""ù Gurven said. However, diet doesn't cover the larger story of the Tsiman√©'s lack of atherosclerosis (narrowing and hardening of the arteries). The Tsiman√© population may consume more calories but are also much more physically active, walking three times more in a given day than the average American. Concurrently, their immune systems are more active as they continuously fight off multiple pathogens, leading to greater energy expenditure. The researchers estimate 10 percent of the Tsiman√© people's resting metabolic rate is spent just for immune activation. Although the Tsiman√© are relatively isolated, increasing access to market goods may change aspects of their diets. One key feature of the study was to observe if the Tsiman√© diet was changing over time, and if there were differences in diet among people living closer to town versus those living a more traditional lifestyle. Within the past five to 10 years, there haven't been overall changes in the Tsiman√© diet, but there have been certain changes in health due to increased access to certain additives including processed sugar, cooking oil and salt. ""Everything gets fried ""î even the rice is fried. Even when they're boiling it in a stew, it's fried first. These additives have increased quite dramatically, and more so closer to town,""ù Gurven said. Over the research period, the scientists noted that percentage body fat, body mass index (BMI) and proportion of the overweight and obese have increased within the population. Total energy and carbohydrate intake of the Tsiman√© increased significantly. Their consumption of sugar, oil and salt also consistently increased over time. In addition to eating a high-fiber, low-fat diet, the Tsiman√© lead extremely physically active lives. Activities such as hunting, foraging, farming and fishing keep men physically active an average of 6-7 hours daily and women active for 4-6 hours. / Courtesy of Michael Gurven To enhance their study, the researchers collected similar data from the ethnolinguistically and genetically similar Moset√©n population. Another Bolivian indigenous group, the Moset√©n differ in that they were acculturated into the Bolivian national system earlier than the Tsiman√©. The Moset√©n have greater access to electricity and running water and more connections to town. They still live a somewhat subsistence lifestyle, but with more access to market goods, they rely less on wild game and fish. The Moset√©n served as a kind of ""counterpoint""ù to the Tsiman√© to show what the latter group might look like 15 years from now, Gurven said. The researchers found that compared to the Tsiman√©, the Moset√©n ate a lot more sugar, used more cooking oil and ate much more dried meat that they bought in the market. On average, they were heavier and more sedentary, with higher cholesterol levels and blood pressure. ""We suspect that the Moset√©n are going to be somewhere intermediate, with more heart diseases than the Tsiman√© but still less than [Americans],""ù Gurven said. ""And so the idea was that we could look at their diet and they'll be further along in terms of access to processed foods [than the Tsiman√©].""ù Still, the Moset√©n diet ""isn't all bad""ù, Gurven explained. It is more diverse than the Tsiman√© diet, and diversity tends to allow for better micronutrient access. Only nine items, characterized mostly by starchy staples, meat and fish, accounted for 75 percent of the Tsiman√© diet. The Moset√©n diet featured a greater number of individual food items, and more calories came from dairy, legumes and other fruits and vegetables. As the Tsiman√© and Moset√©n populations experience an ongoing nutrition transition, the study illustrates the link between diet and an increase in noncommunicable chronic diseases. With more salt, oil and processed sugar being included in their diet, the Tsiman√© face potential negative health consequences that suggest findings of minimal cardiovascular disease may not endure. ""Part of my interest is not just what lessons we can learn for America but how can we think about and help prevent any onslaught of chronic disease that might face this population in the same way that has faced native North Americans all over, Australian aborigines, etcetera. If diet doesn't change all that much, but all of a sudden people's activity drops substantially, then what happens? So there's this change that's occurring. We're trying to use our understanding of how this works to see at what risk [for heart disease] these people might be in in the future,""ù Gurven said.

science,UCSB Researchers Help Develop New Technique to Detect Changes in Bone Structure,10-Jan-19,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/ucsb-researchers-help-develop-new-technique-to-detect-changes-in-bone-structure/,"Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone density, resulting in bones becoming porous and thin and increasing the risk of bone fracture. While osteoporosis can affect any bone in the body, the most common sites are the spine, hip and wrist. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Our bones constantly form and absorb bone tissue throughout our lives. What becomes worrisome is when we have a progressively greater loss of bone density as we age, which could lead to osteoporosis. A disease that causes the deterioration and fragility of bones, osteoporosis increases the risk for bone fractures. While it affects over 10 million people over the age of 50 in the United States and millions more around the world, osteoporosis oftentimes isn't diagnosed until one has already experienced a bone fracture. The bone disease is typically tested for by measuring bone mineral density (BMD), which assesses the amount of calcium and other minerals in bones. However, some studies have indicated that BMD may not be well correlated with predicting fracture risk as there is significant overlap in BMD between healthy individuals and those with fractures. Still, BMD in conjunction with measuring the architecture of trabecular bone itself can provide a fuller picture of bone strength. ""That's the origin of the project, is to be able to combine this new clinical technique to probe the structure of bone, to validate this technique and identify some markers of the bone structure that can be used to potentially classify whether bone is healthy or osteoporotic,""ù Chantal Nguyen, a graduate student in the UC Santa Barbara Department of Physics, said. Along with her advisor, Jean Carlson, Nguyen partnered with local medical imaging startup bioProtonics to consult and assist in validating the ability of the magnetic resonance technique the company developed ""î called µ-Texture ""î to probe the texture of various biological tissues at the micron level (µ). Their study ""Novel magnetic resonance technique for characterizing mesoscale structure of trabecular bone""ù has been published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. To help determine parameters for diagnostic data related to various biological tissues, the researchers started out with bone. ""It's easy to see the difference between bone and not bone in a structure, so it's an easier tissue to start off with to study,""ù Nguyen said. ""The differences in the structure of bone are easier to resolve.""ù There are two types of bone in the body: cortical bone and trabecular bone. The harder and denser cortical bone forms an outer protective layer that encases trabecular bone. Mostly found in the interior of vertebrae and the femur, trabecular bone consists of a ""spongy""ù web-like structure of connected struts and rods called trabeculae. With age, the trabeculae will erode and perforate and is associated with diseases like osteoporosis. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is the leading method for imaging bone and other tissues at high resolutions. However, micro-CT involves a high level of radiation, preventing its usage on humans in vivo and instead restricting it to small animals and isolated samples. One method that could be used to image the living human body is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) though it also faces limitations. MRI cannot achieve the same quality of resolution for bone imaging due to challenges of motion. It takes longer to be able to generate an image than with micro-CT and even involuntary movements from a patient, such as the heart beating or involuntary twitches, can negatively affect the resolution. (a) and (b) show example raw micro-CT image slices from vertebral body slices, with (b) displaying signs of osteoporosis. (c) exhibits a baseline healthy section of a micro-CT image, and (d) and (e) exhibit the same section at increasing stages of simulated osteoporosis. / Courtesy of Royal Society Open Science The µ-Texture MRI technique doesn't actually image the body but samples a region of tissue in question by acquiring data from frequency values relevant to the structure of the tissue, Nguyen said. By taking fewer measurements, µ-Texture is able to overcome these motion limitations. It can still produce high-resolution data that can help in diagnosing and monitoring diseases without the need to acquire an entire 2-D magnetic resonance image. ""What µ-Texture does is it picks out which frequency values are most relevant to the structure that you're going to probe to then convert that back to images you can see. So it takes that data in a shorter amount of time, and the hope is with that data we're able to determine some sort of markers that tells us whether a bone is healthy or diseased,""ù Nguyen said. ""The idea of probing bone texture is not to actually look at or measure the density of bone, because this is a technique of probing bone that is completely distinct from BMD testing,""ù Nguyen continued. ""We don't want to measure bone density or acquire just a simple bulk measure of how much bone is there, but to actually be able to probe textures, to be able to get markers from this web of struts and see if we can extract information about how thick the struts are, how many struts there are. Some sort of finer detail measures than just ""òthere's this much bone, period.'""ù With the µ-Texture technique, the researchers calculated a ratio metric that could distinguish osteoporotic from healthy bone characteristics to identify potentially osteoporotic bone. One potential limitation is that there are certain wavelength frequencies of trabeculae that the µ-Texture cannot probe. Nonetheless, the µ-Texture technique shows much potential as a rapid, non-invasive method to improve detection and monitoring of bone disease. While this study focused specifically on trabecular bone, the µ-Texture method can be applied to other biological tissues. It can be used to probe the texture of brain tissue ""î specifically to detect the onset of diseases like Alzheimer's, which is marked by the degradation of the neuronal architecture of the brain. ""This technique is, in theory, able to be applied to, for instance, the lungs and the heart, and is able to detect the growth of tumors as well. It can be used for any tissue that exhibits sort of textural changes with the onset of disease,""ù Nguyen said. ""The ultimate goal is to be able to implement it clinically. If you're already going to be getting an MRI scan for whatever reason, you could append this µ-Texture procedure at the end of that. It would be very short. Within the context of osteoporosis, the idea is to be able to detect the onset of osteoporosis as early on as possible so that you can implement new lifestyle changes to try to slow the onset of disease.""ù

science,Underneath the Surface: Shrinking Groundwater in the United States,17-Jan-19,9:32 AM,['Sunidhi Sridhar'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/underneath-the-surface-shrinking-groundwater-in-the-united-states/,"Groundwater resources are stressed by near-surface contamination and excessive withdrawals, and deep groundwater resources are potentially threatened by contamination from oil and gas production and injection wells. / Courtesy of Environmental Research Letters Given the fragile state of today's climate and environment, it comes as no surprise that many of the planet's vital natural resources are threatened. New research indicates that the supply of groundwater in the United States ""î which plays an integral role in meeting the irrigation and consumption needs of the population ""î might be in more finite supply than previously thought. Debra Perrone, an assistant professor in UCSB's Department of Environmental Studies, and Scott Jasechko, an assistant professor in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, conducted research examining the depths at which groundwater transitions from fresh to saline. The use of saline water in irrigation affects the crops' ability to absorb nutrients efficiently, and excessive salinity in drinking water can alter the regulation of ion levels and can result in net dehydration in both humans and livestock. The research process, conducted in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Arizona, is documented in Environmental Research Letters, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal. The team calculated the degree of separation between fresh groundwater and brackish groundwater in over 25 sedimentary basins throughout the United States. They then looked at data from regional wells to determine at which depths groundwater is accessed for ""domestic, agricultural, or industrial purposes.""ù The results show that the mean depth at which fresh groundwater transitions into brackish groundwater is 550 meters below ground surface. The shallowest transition, however, occurred at 50 meters in the Sedgwick Basin in south-central Kansas, and the deepest transition occurs at 1,350 meters in the Antler Foreland Basin in upper Mississippi. Previous estimates had placed the transition at depths of 1,000 to 2,000 meters, much greater than the findings of this study. This suggests that the supply of fresh groundwater is much more limited than expected. Minerals and other contaminants can dissolve into groundwater that is in contact with rock, and the rampant gas and oil activity, such as drilling and well operations, throughout the nation serves to further decrease the supply of potable water available for use. While the required separation between gas and oil activity and water wells is most likely no less than 350 meters, data published in Marine and Petroleum Geology has revealed that fewer than one percent of fractures satisfy that regulation. ""A major takeaway from this work is that fresh waters are finite, that overusing fresh water can disrupt food production, manufacturing and household water supplies,""ù Jasechko explained, as quoted in The Current. ""The more we learn, the smaller and more precious that fresh and unfrozen fraction seems to be.""ù As the world's largest source of fresh water, groundwater is a vital resource that many communities rely on; the U.S. Geological Survey states that 33 percent of the public supply of water comes from groundwater, and some major U.S. cities, like San Antonio, depend entirely on groundwater for their water needs. In the coming future, it is crucial that greater measures are put in place in order to protect and defend our already vulnerable groundwater supplies.

science,Microbial Assassins: Changing the Face of Modern Antibiotics,17-Jan-19,10:38 AM,['Sunidhi Sridhar'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/microbial-assassins-changing-the-face-of-modern-antibiotics/,"Looking back at the scientific advancements throughout the history of medicine, it is evident that these past decades have transformed the way humans approach the treatment of infections and diseases. From the breakthrough discovery of antibiotics in the early 20th century to the latest developments in targeted cancer therapies, new research continues to progress at warp speed. Here at UC Santa Barbara, a team of researchers has detected a mechanism by which various strains of bacteria target and destroy rival strains. The widespread use of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections has resulted in widespread resistance of these antibiotics, and this may lead to difficulties in controlling illnesses that are now easily preventable. As Kiho Song, a fifth-year doctoral candidate and graduate researcher, explained, the human microbiome is composed of tremendously diverse microorganisms; antibiotics that are commonly administered can at times be ineffective at identifying and eliminating bacteria that carry the infection. This study, however, reveals a procedure in which bacteria will recognize other bacteria, often of the same species, and deliver a toxin to destroy them. The reason for this is that bacteria of the same species often compete against one another for the same niche, and this will eliminate any competition for limited resources. When a bacterium identifies a molecule on the surface of another bacterium in close contact, its sensor filaments will bind to it. The bacterium will then secrete the destructive toxin. These findings are of great promise to the scientific community, Song pointed out, as ""we can equip helpful bacteria with a toxin-delivering system to target and destroy harmful ones. Such specificity could give us more control over our microbiome and our health.""ù The researchers studied the toxin delivery system by which a strain of E. coli, EC93, inhibited the growth of rival E. coli strain K-12. This model system sheds light on how this mechanism is wielded against specific cells, which could have significant implications in addressing the increasingly worrisome issue of antibiotic resistance. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The presence of such toxin delivery systems has been known to researchers for some time and is quite common in pathogens. Contact-dependent growth inhibition systems, referred to as CDI, were first observed in a strain of E. coli present in rat intestines. This strain, EC93, inhibited the growth of a different strain of E. coli called K-12. The results from this study, however, significantly increase our understanding in regard to how these systems generally work. The model system, developed under the supervision of faculty member Dr. Christopher Hayes, uses electron cryotomography, a high-resolution imaging technology, to take a closer look at the proteins that form the filament as well as the infiltration of the cell periplasm, the gel matrix between the inner cytoplasmic membrane and the bacterial outer membrane, by the toxin. These extracellular filaments measure a mere 33 nanometers and are located on the N-terminal end of the effector molecule. On the C-terminal end of the molecule, there is a programmed secretion arrest so that toxins are not released in the absence of a target cell. When the bacterium is in close proximity to a target cell, the filaments on the N-terminal will bind to a receptor protein and the C-terminal will activate secretion. In order to be destroyed by sibling cells, the bacteria carry immunity proteins, which neutralize toxins that may be delivered into their periplasm. When asked about any major challenges or complications that arose throughout the research process, Song responded that, as with most research, the question he and his team sought to address required the contributions of many intelligent and innovative minds. ""Our discovery is built on collaboration and group effort. Being a young grad student at the beginning of the project, I especially needed more help from the team. I owe much to my advisor, Professor Christopher Hayes, and my co-author, Dr. Zachary Ruhe, for their guidance. Our findings wouldn't be possible without the other co-author, Dr. Poorna Subramanian, and her expertise.""ù This study comes at a time when scientists and researchers across the world are searching for ways to further improve the effectiveness of antibiotics, and its findings may lead to improved drug delivery technologies. With the rise of antimicrobial resistance posing a major threat to people's health and wellbeing, there is an urgent need for new developments within the industry in order to contain the spread of infectious diseases.

science,Gut Feeling: Studying Interactions in the Microbiome,24-Jan-19,9:26 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/gut-feeling-studying-interactions-in-the-microbiome/,"Some scientists compare the gut microbiome to a garden. This displays the diverse ecosystem containing various types of bacteria that might be found in a healthy gut. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The importance of our gut microbiome ""î influential in our metabolism, immune function and physiology ""î can't be overstated. Simply put, the tens of trillions of bacteria and other microbes residing in our digestive system play a huge role in health and disease. Naturally then, identifying which microbes holds high interest in the scientific community. At UC Santa Barbara, Jean Carlson's lab is investigating this matter using fruit flies. Studying flies' smaller gut microbiome containing five naturally occurring bacteria could provide insight into the more complex human gut microbiome. ""We've known for a while that bacteria influence host health ""î like if you've ever had food poisoning, you definitely know that something in your gut is making you feel bad. But I don't think we've known really to what extent, like is it really just that one bacteria, whether it's there or not?""ù Eric Jones, a graduate student researcher in the Department of Physics, said. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, aimed to track how the composition of the microbes influences fly physiology and behavior through measures including lifespan, maturity rate and fecundity. After giving different combinations of bacteria to the flies, Jones and his colleagues measured how many eggs the flies laid. They recorded the number of eggs from flies that were given individual types of bacteria and those that had a combination of bacteria. ""With this, we were able to discern how much of it is from one of the bacteria or the other, versus how much of the number of eggs laid was due to the combinations, or the interactions, between those bacteria,""ù Jones said. Using the fly as a model organism, the scientists found that the gut microbial composition influences a fly's life history trade-off, the compromise between the number of produced offspring and its life expectancy. ""Somehow this combination of laying eggs times how long it lives is roughly constant. By giving a fly different types of bacteria, you shift it to get it to lay more eggs and live less long, versus lay fewer eggs and live longer. You can change that, where you are on that line, based on the type of bacteria you feed it,""ù Jones said. This is also related to the flies' fitness, meaning a species' potential ability to carry on its genes. Regardless of the types of bacteria they fed the flies, fitness was also relatively constant. The researchers used five core gut bacteria species belonging to the Lactobacillus and Acetobacter genera in the common fruit fly to model and analyze the interactions of microbes in the gut. Studying the persistent gut microbiome in flies that may be similar to those in higher organisms may provide fundamental insight into more complex and diverse microbiomes. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The researchers attempted to capture the phenotypes by predicting how many eggs a fly would lay if it were given bacteria A and B based on knowing the number of eggs it laid for A and for B, each. Around 60 percent of the time, their expectations were correct. The times they were unable to predict the amount indicates that other interactions between bacteria were occurring. ""We found that just knowing whether the bacteria was going to be there or not gives you a decent amount of information, but there is something else there,""ù Jones said. The presence or absence of a particular bacteria was significant, but there was a more complex, higher order interaction, depending on the context (the environment and the other bacteria present), that mattered more. ""The whole is more than the sum of its parts. It's not just the individual microbes but, rather, it's the microbes in their context. It's the microbes being there with other microbes being there as well, like the combination effect ""î the interactions ""î that really matter,""ù Jones said. This could have implications for how scientists study the microbiome, as well as what to consider in a clinical setting. Perhaps instead of looking for one bacteria, the entire microbial composition as a whole should be appraised, Jones explained. ""In humans we find that by the time you're three years old, your microbiome is pretty constant, relatively stable. But between birth to three years old, it's changing a lot. As it develops, what's happening is very similar to what's happening with the flies in which you're ingesting bacteria and they either stick or don't stick and grow."" Jones continued, ""If we had a better understanding of how these microbiomes developed, maybe we could use that to better understand how human microbiomes develop and we could maybe see what types of food are good to give in order to have a solid, robust microbiome. It's the hope that by understanding the probabilistic assembly of the microbiome of the fruit fly, we can use that insight to inform human microbiome health.""ù Comments are closed.

Women with degrees in science, math or engineering are vastly outnumbered in the tech industry, especially in careers that rely on computer coding. According to a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, women receive a mere 18 percent of computer science bachelor's degrees in the United States. A number of top universities across the nation, however, are exerting a greater effort to close this gap ""î including UCSB. This past weekend, the American Association of University Women (AAUW) at UCSB hosted their first annual Womxn/Hacks on campus. It welcomed all female-identifying undergraduate and graduate students to participate in a 36-hour-long competitive hackathon, regardless of prior knowledge or expertise in computer science. These programmers collaborated with one to three other partners to create and submit a project, and at the end of the event were to present their hard work in front of their peers and industry professionals. Priscilla Siow, a first-year environmental studies major, and her team built an Android app that is centered on providing safety for women. Siow explained that her team's goal was to create something that specifically targets safe spaces for LGBTQ and minority women as well as women in general. Her teammate, Kara Suharitdumrong, further described how their app works. ""There is one function that we put all throughout the app so that you can tap it and it will call a CSO for you. It can also work as a heat map, so based on what people rate certain areas, you can collect that data and project it. These red zones have more incidents where people may feel uncomfortable,""ù the third-year computer science major said. Photo by Ida Kazerani For several teams, this hackathon was a new experience and an introduction to competitive coding. Nandhana Sathish, a first-year computer science major from UC Irvine, and her teammates decided to learn Swift, a multipurpose programming language used to develop iOS applications. Using what they learned, they created an app called Ease Anxiety. ""Basically,""ù Sathish explained, ""once you open the app, you're in your happy place. You practice breathing exercises, which the app will help you do.""ù When asked about the importance of women's involvement in STEM and (especially) in coding, fourth-year anthropology major Haven Kato said, ""I feel like we need to step out into the world a little more and show what we can do. They portray men as primarily in STEM and tech, but that doesn't mean that women can't do it. It's important to show that we're capable.""ù Sathish added, ""In a lot of computer science classes I've been in, the boys in the group would say, ""òOh, we have to let the girl code now.' If we have this kind of event where girls have an encouraging environment, it empowers us to do more.""ù Photo by Ida Kazerani In addition to the collaborative hackathon, the weekend-long event offered several workshops to expose participants to the various aspects of computer science and coding. For example, the Intro to Web Development workshop demonstrated how to launch a web app on Google Cloud Platform, and the Machine Learning Made Easy workshop used MATLAB, a programming software, to look into the basics of machine learning. For many participants with limited prior experience in coding, these workshops served as invaluable exposure. Second-year sociology and Spanish double major Christine Nguyen said, ""For [my team], it was really about the workshops. We started going to a lot of these because there are a lot of resources here that you wouldn't get otherwise, especially hardware. They have a whole hardware lab here, which is really expensive.""ù In any field, diverse perspectives are the backbone of innovation and progress, and the tech industry is no exception. Womxn/Hacks and other similar events go a long way in empowering and encouraging underrepresented minorities to share their ideas and discoveries. Photo by Ida Kazerani For several budding female computer scientists here at UCSB, this weekend helped to unlock their potential and to find exciting opportunities in coding. Fourth-year linguistics major Faviola Ruiz-Zamudio said that she wanted to participate in a hackathon since she was a first-year but felt intimidated by the ones that were offered before. ""I'm pretty excited that this event occurred because I didn't know that this was the first one ever, just for women, at UCSB. This one was really inclusive, which I really liked.""ù Her teammate, Nguyen, agreed, ""It's overwhelming ""î but in a good way. When I first signed up for this, I didn't think it was going to be a huge event. It's honestly been very surprising and rewarding just being here.""ù

science,Let‚'s Tau-lk about Tau: Exploring the Protein,31-Jan-19,11:51 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/lets-tau-lk-about-tau-exploring-the-protein/,"Tau protein is found in neurons, including on dendrites and axons. Tau accumulation is often seen in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, disrupting brain cell function, which eventually results in their death. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons In healthy conditions, the tau protein aids in microtubule stability in neurons in the brain. Under pathological conditions, tau aggregates and forms neurofibrillary tangles. The buildup of these neurofibrillary tangles is characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. ""Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease, two different neurodegenerative diseases, have been found to have different shape of tau aggregates in the brain. So it's very important you have some type of equivalent between at the molecular level ""î the shape of your aggregates ""î and at the organism level ""î the disease you have,""ù Yann Fichou, a UC Santa Barbara postdoc researcher in the Songi Han research group, said. But studying the intricate transition from a healthy, soluble form of tau to a pathological, insoluble form presents various challenges. Tau itself is a complicated structure. It's an intrinsically disordered protein, so it doesn't have a well-defined structure in solution. ""That makes most of the methods used in the structural biology and physical chemistry hard to apply for this protein because it's too flexible and too dynamic,""ù Fichou said. Using specific spin-labeling electronic parametric resonance spectroscopy (EPR), the Han research group can track the healthy to pathological transition of tau, which involves changes in its physical state. ""This spin label EPR technique can be used to study the tau in non-structured conditions. It can also be used to study the population properties, specifically the distribution of conformation of tau under certain conditions,""ù Yanxian Lin, a fourth year PhD student in the Han research group, said. Since tau can't be studied in situ (in the brain), researchers often use models to reproduce tau aggregation procedures. This can be accomplished with tau, a cofactor and a seed template. The seed helps trigger aggregation, from which the tau fiber grows. ""What we show in this study is that the seed compilates or gives a certain shape that you can call shape ""òA' in your seed so that what you grow from this seed will most likely be shape ""òA' as well,""ù Fichou said. ""We have the protein in tubes, and then you make aggregates with a cofactor. The reason why you need a cofactor is as simple as because you can't reproduce what you find in the brain without the cofactor,""ù he added. In fact, the cofactor plays a more significant role in the aggregation process than was previously thought, according to the researchers' study. Their findings, ""Cofactors are essential constituents of stable and seeding-active tau fibrils,""ù appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""The cofactor is part of the very nature of the fiber where before it was somewhat thought that you just use it as a tool to reproduce what you find in the brain. Our studies show that it's the very nature of your fibers and potentially it's the very nature of what you have in the brain, too,""ù Fichou said. ""So somehow it changed from being just a tool to being a biologically relevant component of the fibers.""ù Without a cofactor, immature tau is much less likely to replicate the shape of the pathological tau seed. Focusing more on cofactors, including figuring out how they promote the fibril formation mechanism, could be crucial in learning more about how tau aggregation is implicated in certain diseases, the researchers said. With this new perspective, prospective areas of study would seek to pinpoint the identities of potential cofactors and determine if there is one or several. Another area of study would further investigate and better characterize the seed, which has also been previously largely neglected in studies. ""Does a certain seed pair with a certain cofactor, or do they work independently?""ù asked Fichou. This could change how future research approaches studying the mechanism of how tau changes from a healthy to pathological state, according to Lin. He said, ""We should focus on the role of cofactors, instead of just [thinking about] cofactors as a tool to study tau.""ù Comments are closed.

science,"Reduce, Reuse and Reconsider the Effectiveness of Recycling",7-Feb-19,9:32 AM,['Charlotte Marston'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/reduce-reuse-and-reconsider-the-effectiveness-of-recycling/,"Roland Geyer's research states that approximately 91 percent of all plastic has never been recycled. The statistic has won the Royal Statistical Society's 2018 International Statistic of the Year. Rather than recycling, Geyer emphasizes the importance of reducing plastic use and reusing. / Courtesy of Pexels A green initiative propelled by government support and kept alive through catchy slogans, recycling has become integrated into our lives. We all remember growing up with those three looped arrows, and now we glance down at our trash and decide whether to throw it into the gray or blue bins at Davidson. Since 1950, 8,300 million metric tons of plastic have been produced worldwide, but recent research has determined only a small fraction of that has been recycled. Now, the emerging debate is about whether recycling is the best way to manage this massive amount of waste. Dr. Roland Geyer researches the fate of plastics at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. His paper, ""Production, use and fate of all plastics ever made,""ù was published in 2017 in Science Advances and recently won the Royal Statistical Society's 2018 International Statistic of the Year award. This accolade comes as no surprise; Geyer's study showed that only nine percent of the plastic produced has been recycled. This wide-scale analysis looked at all the plastic ever produced on an international scale and where these materials are now. ""We can actually account for all the plastic that we've ever made, and that's kind of unusual because we had data going back all the way to basically the beginning of mass production ""¶ In 1950, the annual global production was, maybe, two million metric tons ""¶ What we see is the growth of plastic production is so phenomenal. We could show that half of the plastic we ever made was made in the last 13 years,""ù Geyer said. The production of plastic is increasing every year, and 79 percent of it still remains in landfills since plastic cannot be broken down by soil but must be incinerated or recycled. The most common form of plastic is polyethylene. Geyer explains that this polymer has variety, stating that ""there's high density polyethylene ""¶ and then there's low density polyethylene,""ù which are things we all come into contact with on a daily basis such as plastic bags. Geyer did not immediately attribute this increase to convenience culture or consumerism. ""It just shows up on the shelf, if you just go grocery shopping, everything now is in ever smaller packs ""¶ It used to be a big bag of nuts and now you can buy a big bag that has lots of little bags.""ù Although consumers don't seek out extra packaging, companies continue to add more since production is cheap, easy and contributes to convenience or even novelty. ""It's not that the consumer makes an active effort to [use more plastic]; they're very willing to go along with that constant increase, but I don't think the consumer is the main driver,""ù Geyer said. In his work, Geyer emphasizes that ""the only environmental benefit of recycling is to avoid new material ""¶ [and] I don't think it's happening to the extent we think it is.""ù This concept of primary product displacement ""î actually using recycled plastic instead of creating more ""î is the only way recycling cuts down on our waste production. Since recycling isn't particularly effective, Geyer notes the importance of the other two R's. ""We all know this waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle ""¶ We always are skipping the first two. I hope our numbers have encouraged people to rediscover ""òreduce' and ""òreuse.'""ù Only nine percent of plastic ever made has been recycled. This concerningly low number shows us where we need to focus our efforts: on reducing plastic use and reusing, instead of routinely consuming single-use plastics. ""Trevor, my ex-Ph.D. student ""¶ says it really nicely. He said, ""òThe only plastic that you don't have to dispose of is the one you never made,'""ù Geyer said. ""As soon as you bring plastic into the world, it's there, and you can recycle it but it's still there ""¶ all you can do is either bury it in a hole or burn it ""¶ recycling doesn't avoid disposal ""î it just delays it.""ù

science,UCSB Researcher Studies Carbon Storage in Soil,7-Feb-19,12:37 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/ucsb-researcher-studies-carbon-storage-in-soil/,"Carbon storage in soil depends on various factors including ""î and notably ""î climate. Changing climate conditions may affect the amount of soil minerals produced that can bond with carbon and store it in the ground. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons In addition to growing plants and making mud pies, soil is good for storing carbon. In fact, soil contains more than double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. With potential to offset some global warming effects, the ability to store carbon in the ground is an important topic for scientists to consider. Carbon retention in soil occurs due to minerals in soil and soil organic matter, such as organic carbon, containing reactive chemical groups that are able to react and bond with each other. ""One of the fundamental characteristics of soil as an entity on Earth's surface is it's material that is neither truly just inorganic or organic. It's actually a chemical combination of the two,""ù Oliver Chadwick, a professor in UC Santa Barbara's departments of Geography and Environmental Studies, said. For more than 25 years, Chadwick has been using Hawaii as a natural laboratory. Containing lava samples ranging from freshly produced to as old as four million years old, Hawaiian soil produces a large amount of reactive minerals that can bond with organic matter. Chadwick and his colleague, Marc Kramer of Washington State University, realized that the soils in Hawaii contained higher levels of carbon than are typically found in soils worldwide. This led them to wonder about the carbon-binding properties of soils in terrestrial landscapes outside of Hawaii. ""And that's a really interesting question ""î what is the carrying capacity, or the absorption capacity, of a soil anywhere for carbon?""ù Chadwick said. Chadwick and Kramer investigated by analyzing soil profiles from globally representative biomes. Their research, ""Climate-driven thresholds in reactive mineral retention of soil carbon at the global scale,""ù appears in Nature Climate Change. ""What we found that was really interesting was that the absorption capacity for carbon really depends on climate to a very great extent,""ù Chadwick said. ""In particular, it depends on the amount of mineral produced under different climate conditions that can then bond to the organic matter.""ù Soils in dry climates, such as deserts, tend to contain relatively little organic matter and have little mineral surface production. This leads to less sequestration of carbon ""î at least, by mineral absorption processes. In contrast, greater plant productivity and more chemically reactive minerals allow wet soils in wet forested biomes to retain much more mineral carbon. Other factors, including low pH and greater water movement, also led to greater carbon absorption. ""We find that the transition from dry soils to wet soils, and the storage associated with it, occurs over a relatively short distance in terms of water balance, which is rainfall minus evaporation,""ù Chadwick said. ""A small change in water balance will affect a very large change in carbon absorption by carbon minerals.""ù Looking from the standpoint of mitigation processes, Chadwick has explored ways to manipulate the soils to be able to store more carbon. However, he explains that soil storage of carbon ""is not going to solve greenhouse warming problems.""ù ""There's a fair amount of evidence suggesting that, in general, soil is storing about as much carbon as it can, given the climate conditions that the soil is in, unless it's been manipulated by humans, like if it's been bulldozed or it's been farmed very heavily,""ù he said. According to Chadwick, one of the main ways humans might be able to effectively increase carbon absorption in soils is to modify farming techniques. By planting deeper rooted plants, such as perennial grasses and trees, organic matter would be injected deeper into the soil. Adding depth would allow mineral production to occur without having the absorptive capacity of those minerals distilled by high levels of carbon. With crucial factors like temperature and precipitation timing expected to change alongside global warming, carbon retention in soils may be highly sensitive to future changes in climate. ""Different parts of the world have very different soils, and the soils are going to be more or less sensitive to changes in climate and how those changes might affect carbon storage in the soil. It all comes back to what the minerals are like in the soil, which itself is partly determined by climate,""ù Chadwick said.

science,The Swipe Right Love Story,14-Feb-19,8:22 AM,['Jennifer Sor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/the-swipe-right-love-story/,"† Even in the current age of prevalent online dating and dating app use, users tend to choose partners based on innate biological inclinations. Male users spend more time focusing on visual elements in their evaluation of potential partners, whereas women pay more attention to different attributes, including financial stability and education. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons There are supposedly plenty of fish in the sea, but before four Harvard graduates formed OkCupid in 2004, never before had the sea seemed so vast, nuanced, and oddly isolating. ""Tonight,""ù says Christian Rudder, co-founder and head of OkCupid's analytics department, ""some 30,000 couples will have their first date because of OkCupid.""ù Of these 30,000, Rudder and his team estimate that 3,000 of them will embark on a long-term relationship, and 200 will be successfully married within the decade. 200 out of 30,000 ""î which makes out to be a .66 percent success rate ""î isn't bad for a matchmaking service, an industry so notoriously rife with rejection, failure and heartache. In the digital age, where potential matches are virtually infinite in quantity, it seems alien to consider the old conventions of dating. With the help of dating apps, a romantic connection can be forged across hundreds of miles within seconds. This is stark contrast from in 1932, the year a University of Pennsylvania survey indicated that nearly half of all couples married someone who lived within twenty blocks from them, concluding that geographical proximity was one of the main predictors of a long-lasting relationship. ""It was easier in the olden days,""ù BBC's Paul Kerley muses. Or perhaps it's Aziz Ansari, in his 2015 book Modern Romance, who words the struggle most succinctly: ""Today's generations are [""¶] turning their 20s into a relentless hunt for more romantic options than previous generations could have ever imagined,""ù he writes. ""You have a recipe for romance gone haywire.""ù Both Kerley and Ansari make a fair point: Gone are the days of ""The Boy Next Door,""ù or stumbling into the love of your life at a coffee shop. This era is a highly advanced, barren wasteland where massive amounts of data and probability science are needed to meet your next lover. While the prospect of online dating is bleak, research has shown that its dystopian implication doesn't deviate as far from our primitive instincts as we might think. ""Many evolutionary psychologists put [online dating trends] down to the power of innate biological drives,""ù Marcel Zentner, a psychology professor at the University of Innsbruck, said. From an evolutionary perspective, Zentner points out, natural selection primes men to seek out signs of fertility in female partners, the logic being that greater fertility leads to a greater chance of survival for his offspring. On the flipside, the same is true for females, having what Zentner refers to as a ""primeval urge""ù to seek wealthy men. Regardless of gender, our romantic preferences lie in the vein of wanting what's best for our offspring. With our underlying biological instincts working in the background, enter the magic of apps like Tinder, Bumble and, of course, OkCupid, all of which continue to grow in popularity. Different methods are formulated to match users to their potential partners, but in general, the premise to online dating is simple: Upload a picture of yourself, or multiple. Fill out OkCupid's questionnaire. Depending on whether you like dogs, long walks on the beach or have a preference for cilantro, OkCupid's algorithm aggregates a feed of potential partners, ordered by compatibility. For apps like Tinder or Bumble, the process is even easier and more intuitive, so much so that its user interface heeds no explanation: Left means you pass, right means you like. Courtesy of Pexels By no coincidence, these platforms reveal trends consistent with the evolutionary research that Zentner outlines. Men, as researchers know, are profoundly visual in their evaluation of female partners, explaining why male online daters spend on average 65 percent more time reviewing photos of his potential matches than his female counterparts. Women, on the other hand, spend 50 percent more time reviewing the profile information of a potential match, paying particular attention to aspects like education (Ivy League Tinder users are predictably in high demand) and career, two reliable indicators of income and financial security. These biological preferences, it seems, are innate: ""Evolution [has] selected and encoded it in our genes, forever,""ù Zentner emphasizes. It appears that, on a platform where both male and female users are allowed to critically examine and filter for certain qualities, are primitive mating instincts are not only at work, but at work more so than ever before. Alicia Cast, UCSB's own sociology professor and researcher, confirms this. ""There still is a tendency for men to slightly emphasize physical attractiveness, whereas women are more likely to [prioritize] things like financial stability,""ù Cast says. She notes that ""those stereotypical views [on love] are still out there,""ù and moreover, still at play when it comes to the forces that drive our attraction to one another. Is it natural to browse through hundreds of potential love matches at the swipe of a finger? Perhaps not, but research at the very least affirms that it is natural to judge and eliminate partners in online dating in the way we do. ""I'm not sure if it's that much different than meeting people through social networks,""ù Cast muses. We have, Cast says, and always have been ""attracted to the things we're attracted to.""ù Her concern for online dating, however, echoes a reservation many users have upon making their accounts: ""We have a sense of unlimited quantity when online dating.""ù Although users' preferences may be evolutionarily based, the ubiquity of potential partners on dating apps has a way of influencing users to ""always think that there may be something greener,""ù Cast says. ""We may be really picky, and we can pick ourselves out of someone who's really quite a good match for us.""ù For any online dater, the thought is comforting, yet simultaneously perturbing: are we alone because there are too few or too many fish in the sea? I'll delete my Tinder if you delete yours.

science,"‚""òTrain Locally, Deploy Globally‚' with AI",14-Feb-19,12:03 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/train-locally-deploy-globally-with-ai/,"Technology undoubtedly plays a fundamental role in tracking climate change. Scientists and researchers can take advantage of a plethora of technological approaches to aid them in their work in widely diverse ways, including using remote sensing tools to monitor the decline of ice sheets at the poles, or in field applications to view the outcomes of environmental management. To help scientists in ""applying artificial intelligence (AI) to help understand and protect the planet""ù, Microsoft and National Geographic have partnered up to sponsor AI for Earth Innovation Grants. Eleven recipients were selected, including UC Santa Barbara's own Kelly Caylor. Caylor, an ecohydrology professor in the Department of Geography and the Bren School of Environmental Science as well as the director of the Earth Research Institute at UCSB, will use this grant to more accurately estimate and track agricultural land use change and groundwater use. ""Agriculture is a major user of water worldwide ""¶ What has been happening and what continues to happen around the world is that as there's a need for greater food production, we started moving agriculture into new areas, places that maybe weren't farmed in the past,""ù Caylor said. Many farms have been supported through rainfall ""î rain-fed agriculture ""î but are increasingly supplemented by groundwater accessed through wells, pumps and irrigation schemes that can be monitored by satellites. ""The goal of our project is to use the historical archive of satellite data to try to map the expansion of these emerging agricultural landscapes and see how much water they're using in order to try to figure out what the impacts are on groundwater in the regions that growth is occurring,""ù Caylor explained. Caylor and his associates, both at UCSB and at other universities, plan to start small. They will focus on places where groundwater use is known well enough ""î such as the irrigation sites in western Nebraska or areas in California ""î to train and hone their technological approaches. Once the researchers build up enough confidence, they will deploy them on a larger scale to other areas of the world where past or present groundwater use isn't monitored as comprehensively and they can do more prediction than confirmation. ""So we start small; ""òtrain locally and then deploy globally' is the strategy,""ù Caylor said. With the Microsoft and National Geographic sponsored AI for Earth Innovation Grant, Kelly Caylor and his colleagues will use artificial intelligence technology to track and estimate changes in agricultural land use and groundwater use in places such as sub-Saharan Africa. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Caylor's past work has been in sub-Saharan Africa, including Zambia. There, agriculture plays a crucial role for a large percentage of the population's livelihoods and has greatly converted from rain-fed to irrigation-dependent agriculture. In addition to figuring out where this change is occurring, Caylor and his colleagues want to know how that shifting land use may impact other important priorities for those countries. ""We're curious to what degree this change in how agriculture is done might be impacting conservation of wildlife in the lands that are placed in conservation in sub-Saharan Africa because it's opening up new areas for agriculture that people weren't using before,""ù Caylor said. The grant also gives free access to cloud-based tools and AI services, provided by Microsoft's Azure platform and National Geographic Labs, that will help Caylor and his team work on their ambitious project. ""National Geographic is interested in solving this problem and answering this question, and we want to do that kind of research. Microsoft is enabling those two things to happen through the support that they're providing computationally. And for us, that's as much of a learning process as it is the learning process of figuring out where the agriculture is [shifting]. So everyone's real excited about that.""ù Microsoft has built a set of machines ""î cloud computing environments ""î that are ""hand-tailored""ù for Caylor and his colleagues' work and optimized to run the types of algorithms they implement. Cloud computing usage hasn't been very common in university research settings until very recently, Caylor said. One reason is because it had been set up more for commercial applications, like Netflix or Google, rather than for the tools researchers utilize. ""It's really exciting just to see what the potential [for that technology] is, but to also have that support from Microsoft to figure out how to realize that potential,""ù Caylor said. Currently the project is in its embryonic stages. ""We're just getting started,""ù Caylor said. ""A lot of what we're trying to do now is getting our feet underneath us with respect to these new systems that Microsoft is giving us to work with""¶a lot of it is retooling and getting ready for the ""òbig race.'""ù ""We're learning a lot every day. That's one of the great things about working with a company like that ""î they really know how to support people and help us get what we need done.""ù

science,Express Yourself: UCSB Researchers Study RNA Roles in Cell Differentiation,21-Feb-19,9:44 AM,['Charlotte Marston'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/express-yourself-ucsb-researchers-study-rna-roles-in-cell-differentiation/,"Golkaram and colleagues set out to identify the patterns and interactions between mRNA and miRNAs, which control and regulate cell development through expressing specific genes. This may give further insight into neurodevelopmental diseases and gene expression patterns. / Courtesy of Pixabay Every cell in our bodies comes from the same source ""î namely, germ cells. So how do these cells develop to serve so many different functions in our body? From neural cells with axons over two feet long to skin cells with touch-sensitive hair follicles, the functions vary vastly due to different gene expression. All these cells have the same DNA we were born with, but messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribes the genes while microRNA (miRNA) regulates this process, resulting in many different, highly specific cell types. Several different departments at UCSB, UCSF and the Indian Institute of Technology recently worked together on an article titled ""Regulation of cell-type-specific transcriptomes by microRNA networks during human brain development,""ù published by Nature Neuroscience in 2018. The researchers essentially created a library of all mRNAs and miRNAs to identify the differentiation of cell types in the developing brain. These RNA fragments are expressed differently in every cell and are directly associated with the function of a cell. The single stranded mRNA works to transcribe genes into proteins for use in the cell. This gene transcription is regulated by non-coding miRNA which can alter genes after transcription, suppress unnecessary genes and serve as a marker for cell malfunction. Mahdi Golkaram, the first co-author of this paper explains, ""The core hypothesis was that the pattern in this network of microRNAs and mRNAs is related to cell-type specificity.""ù Golkaram received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering at UCSB in September 2018. He worked in Linda Petzold's lab to contribute a bioinformatics approach to this paper. Bioinformatics, the use of computer programming to organize and interpret biological information, can aid in understanding genomics. This analysis enabled researchers to condense and comprehend a large number of mRNAs, miRNAs and all of the patterns between them. These expression patterns can be useful tools in identifying how our cells operate, and in this case, how they develop. ""During development we have only two cells: an egg and a sperm and then they divide. But how do we get to a complex set of cells like the adult brain beginning from only two cells? The distribution of cell types differs significantly, and the ratio of different cell types is very important. The imbalance of this ratio can be pathogenic,""ù Golkaram said. In the most basic sense, there are neurons that communicate information with electrical signals and glial cells that assist the neurons by maintaining a precise environment in the brain. An alteration in this ratio can cause disruption in brain function and identifying the RNA expression patterns may help us identify this early in development. ""We can look at disease ""î for example, autism was one ""î but there are several different prenatal diseases we can potentially understand by looking at microRNAs. Introducing a mechanistic model that tells you this gene is causing this disorder is the first step to finding a cure,""ù Golkaram said. In order to organize such a complex system, Golkaram created a computer-learning program that would recognize patterns in the miRNA and mRNA. These patterns can be used to understand how the cell is differentiating and how it will function in a fully formed adult brain. In an attempt to simplify the concept, Golkaram explains, ""Certain mRNAs and microRNAs tend to have something in common and we found that what they have in common is actually cell types. We showed how they interact to control and regulate cell-type specificity at different locations or different stages of development.""ù The lab determined these RNA sequences using qPCR quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Instead of proliferating the genomes of a population of cells, they profiled single cells to find the specific mRNA and miRNA interactions. This single-cell sequencing can further define the differences between individual brain cell types. Golkaram gives an analogy. ""If you want to find an address and we have street addresses, zip codes, apartment numbers, it's essentially the same thing. We have mRNA expression and now we have miRNA expression. Each of these can be used as important information to determine cell types.""ù Cell-type-specific transcripts were presented as a bipartite network, meaning that a single miRNA has access to regulation of many mRNAs, but a single mRNA only has a few miRNAs that operate on it. This was then analyzed by a ""bipartite community detection algorithm,""ù as stated in the paper. The algorithm developed by Golkaram can detect patterns of the interactions between mRNA and miRNA and lead to insight regarding neurodevelopmental disorders. This emerging ""transcriptome""ù research can reveal a lot about how species differ so greatly when much of our genomes contain the same genetic material. Golkaram suggests that this research could take an evolutionary turn. ""A comparison of a human brain to an ape's or a monkey's brain would be a very interesting evolutionary biology question ""¶ That could be answered by looking at microRNAs and why certain genes are only expressed in humans but not in apes.""ù Each cell in our body contains the same DNA ""î our genomic blueprint ""î so this gene expression is crucial to understanding cell function. This experiment has provided strong insight into the patterns of expression in brain cells and could lead to a better understanding of diseases in early brain development.

science,"Chasing the Ever ‚""òMoving Target‚' of Ocean Restoration",21-Feb-19,11:52 AM,['Cristian Loza'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/chasing-the-ever-moving-target-of-ocean-restoration/,"To boost the recovery of marine species, the NOAA has programs to disentangle large whale species. While such measures including ending the harvest of cetaceans allow for initial recovery, temporal changes in environmental conditions demand revisions in setting achievable recovery targets and implementing innovative interventions. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons ""There is a real disconnect between what you hear in the upper echelon of the political sphere and [what you hear from] the folks that are in the water doing their best to enable ocean recoveries,""ù UC Santa Barbara marine ecologist Kurt Ingeman said. Ingeman is currently working in Oregon to fight the uphill battle of ocean restoration in a rapidly changing environment. With 2018 being the fourth-hottest year on record for global temperatures according to USA Today and the hottest recorded for ocean temperatures according to National Geographic, activists like Ingeman are striving to keep the world's oceans alive and strong for both humans and animals alike. Ingeman, along with colleagues Adrian Stier and Jameal Samhouri, have recently published a paper in the journal Science that discusses the ever ""moving target""ù that is ocean restoration. This ""moving target""ù not only reflects the human race and its demands, but also encompasses Earth's changing environment as a whole. The pace and magnitude of environmental change, especially as systems, are prone to abrupt tipping points, and may overwhelm slow-moving ocean conservation efforts. In other words, this nimble target renders slower adaptive efforts useless. ""This is a slow and difficult process, but that is not the fault of the people doing work. In many cases it's due to limitations in funding, so in order to develop the rapid responses required for climate change we need more funding, but unfortunately that is not always what we see with the priorities at the political level,""ù Ingeman said. ""Like turning a supertanker""ù is how Ingeman described making alterations to the governance side of ocean restoration policies. For example, the paper discusses how one-quarter of U.S. federally-listed species lack a recovery plan. Furthermore, half of these policies are over 20 years old and even fewer address climate change. Unfortunately, even the top members of our current administration have demonstrated they don't believe in climate change. ""In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In the coming days, expected to get even colder ""¶ What the hell is going on with Global Warming? Please come back fast, we need you!""ù President Donald Trump tweeted on Jan. 28 in response to the polar vortex that overtook the Midwest. A study done by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication in 2018 shows that 14 percent of Americans do not believe that climate change is happening. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are about 327 million people living in the United States, so 14 percent comes out to about 45.7 million people. Unfortunately, nationwide efforts to address ocean recovery are bogged down or rendered futile without discussing the elephant in the room. To make matters more difficult, the idea of a successful oceanic recovery is not the same to everyone. Ingeman's paper describes recovery as the return of population viability and ecological function. A component of this concept is to accept the possibility of a range of recovery scenarios rather than a single optimum state. This outlook is necessary when attempting to adjust to this moving target. Fortunately, as a byproduct of evolving technology in the 21st century, the ability to spread awareness has widened the scope of conservation efforts. ""I think that the part of my job that is to communicate my findings and to get people to be aware of their impacts on the ocean has only gotten easier. The challenge is not getting lost in the sea of information,""ù Ingeman said. Agencies like the California Department of Fish and Game and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are constantly working to make people aware of their impact on our oceans as well as our planet. ""The personnel from the government agencies that I work with include California Department of Fish and Game as well as the NOAA. These are conservation heroes,""ù Ingeman said. Santa Barbara County is doing its best to keep up with the moving target, as Santa Barbara Channelkeeper lists a total of 19 total Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in its channel (five along the coastline and 14 surrounding the Channel Islands). These MPAs are dedicated to protecting wildlife from overfishing and overdevelopment. ""Support politicians at all levels that care about and demonstrate a conservation ethic. You can also vote with your wallet by choosing products that don't degrade the ocean. Many people are on board with eliminating plastic straws, which is a great start, but there is more we can do like eliminating plastic packaging or taking a look at our seafood. To help recover the oceans is to be very careful and understand where your seafood comes from and be sure it's from a sustainable source,""ù Ingeman explained. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has a ""Seafood Watch""ù app (available on iPhone and Android) that helps users buy seafood from sustainable sources. With global temperatures rising, ocean health is at high risk for rapid degradation. According to a study by The Guardian, we have approximately just over a decade to act quickly as a planet, or the ever ""moving target""ù of ocean restoration may become unhittable and unreachable. Now, more than ever, being timely in our actions matters.

Compared to other racial groups, Black college students have the highest dropout rate at two-year and four-year colleges, the U.S. Department of Education states. Furthermore, African Americans represent just seven percent of S.T.E.M. majors in college, a†report by Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce finds. They tend to be underrepresented in college majors associated with the highest-paying, fastest-growing occupations, including S.T.E.M., business and health. Several UCSB faculty members and graduate students in social sciences and humanities shared their thoughts on the disproportionate representation for Black students not just in S.T.E.M. but in higher education in general, as well as how they perceive their identity affects their academic and professional experiences at UCSB.

Professors need to be aware of that, and especially in S.T.E.M.,""ù she said. For Laurent-Perrault, it's about ""improving and addressing the tools students were given to navigate higher education and opportunities to do things that they might not have had [otherwise or previously].""ù It's about ""applying that conscientiousness and self-reflection,""ù such as by perhaps having a professor encourage first-generation students who may not have had a smooth journey with certain types of expectations and pressures bestowed upon them. ""It has to be a concerted effort that is respectful to the student and the parents of the student and at the same time provides tools,""ù she summarized. Laurent-Perrault stresses ""the comfort and well-being and social experience of people of African descent""ù as well. Having an administration or faculty representative of the student population can be a driving factor in attracting more underrepresented students, and indeed, numerous†studies indicate that having race-congruent teachers have significant positive effects, including leading to higher performance levels by students. ""Not so much because you need to have people who look like you, but because you need to have people who carry culture like you so that the social experience is also rewarding,""ù Laurent-Perrault explained. But beyond the present issues, she points to how adequate representation in history plays an imperative role in informing not only the past but also the present and possible future. ""We need to look into the history of who was excluded from what. When you look at the rate of invention and the number of African Americans who have participated in the invention of things like the locomotive engine or the refrigerator, many of the things that we take for granted today have had contributions from African American inventors, and in times when it was even harder to have access [to those fields]. So [part of it] is demystifying the myth of S.T.E.M. always being this overwhelming white thing.""ù Courtesy of David Stamps David Stamps, fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Communication ""We're grossly underrepresented in a lot of spaces, and that is due to a lot of factors, some intentional and some unintentional. My thoughts are that it's time to correct course. It's time to make space and create resources so that this can be addressed appropriately. It's time to find co-conspirators and allies that see the value in creating equity and inclusion,""ù David Stamps, a Ph.D. candidate in UCSB's Department of Communication who identifies as African American, said. ""I specifically look for ways to empower individuals who look like me that are constantly reminded that they don't belong simply because they don't see themselves resembled in those spaces, that they do belong and they have things that are very valuable to add, and that who they are is more than enough.""ù ""That's why I pursue this career. I want people who look like me to see themselves in classrooms. I want people who look like me to see themselves in scholarship and being represented appropriately. I think that the power is shifting. The more agency that people of color have, the more push we can have to not only survive but thrive,""ù Stamps said. Stamps is currently the only Black male Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication, with nearly 30 years having passed since the last. ""My racial identity is at the forefront of everything I do because [what I'm doing] has [almost] never existed before. So what's considered normal and what's considered generalizable doesn't even apply to me. Everything I do, there is this heightened awareness because I am bringing my Blackness in because people have never experienced this. And so there's all these stereotypes and stigmas I have to push back against. And I welcome it because the only way things are ever going to change is if people have to confront it and they're thoroughly engaged,""ù he said. ""When I say I want a seat at the table, I'm not asking anyone to give up theirs. I am telling people to move over. There is more than enough space for diverse flavors and diverse identities and diverse schools of thought to all co-exist,""ù Stamps continued. ""I live a very unapologetic life. And so I think when people live unapologetically and embrace their identity, they shouldn't have to assimilate or acculturate their identity to make other people see the value in them.""ù Stamps underscores why having Black history portrayed accurately is vital to understanding and accepting this. ""Black history is about celebrating people who fought for civil rights and people who were trailblazers and people who were in active resistance and for people who fought for agency. It's not just about what's palatable for majority group members and not Blacks. And oftentimes, that's what Black History Month is. It's Dr. Martin Luther King and it's Rosa Parks. Sometimes it should be Marcus Garvey and Nat Turner and different individuals that didn't necessarily want to play nice when it came to Black liberation and Black freedom. That's also Black history, and it's a rich history that non-Black people should engage in and understand. We didn't get here just by non-violent resistance alone, and that narrative can misinform an individual. So I would want to lay claim to what Black history really is ""î that spectrum of Black identity, the spectrum of blackness ""î and not just those that are palatable to individuals.""ù Courtesy of Raymok Ketema Raymok Ketema, first-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of History ""My Blackness has shaped my experience here at UCSB ""¶ completely in totality,""ù Raymok Ketema, a Ph.D. student in the Department of History who identifies as African American, said. She, too, points out the potentially detrimental effects from history shining the spotlight on some Black historical figures while missing others. ""Something that could be interesting or is important for us to consider is who has been placed in the forefront as the historical Black figures and why are they in those positions? Who are other people doing similar work and why did they not get the same attention?""ù she asked. For example, Ketema looks to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as someone she wishes had better representation in history. ""I think that [Madikizela-Mandela] is a powerful figure that gets obscured in our history a lot, that gets painted as a villainous figure, especially when you think of her compared to how Nelson Mandela has been represented. I think that she's a good person to look at in Black history and somebody that I admire deeply.""ù
Her perception of a lack of diversity and of Black student representation on campus is what motivates her to pursue higher education. ""The best way to correct this would be to actually incorporate African history into our curriculums. Then we wouldn't just need to dedicate a month to Black history. These gaps in our knowledge systems need to be filled, and so that has really motivated my desires to get a Ph.D. so hopefully one day I will be able to teach and fill in some of these gaps and holes that have been present for so long,""ù she said. Relatedly, re-incorporating the ""marginalized from science""ù would help make S.T.E.M. ""a lot more attainable and accessible to students of color,""ù Ketema added. She also emphasizes the necessity of holistic knowledge and placing less significance on classifying what fits into S.T.E.M. versus humanities versus social sciences. Rather, she said, breaking down these categories to prevent pigeonholing would also help with fixing the curriculums in schools. Courtesy of Sharon Tettegah Sharon Tettegah, Director of the Center for Black Studies Research and Professor in the Department of Black Studies ""I am proud of who I am as a Black woman, or an African American woman. I've worked very hard and I think that I wear being an African American or a Black American as a badge of honor in some ways, so it's really important that individuals understand that my identity is most salient around being an African American woman, or a Black woman,""ù Sharon Tettegah, the director of the Center for Black Studies Research and a professor in the Department of Black Studies, said. ""Being at the intersection [of S.T.E.M. and social sciences], knowing there's a Center for Black Studies Research and having the ability to shape the narrative behind S.T.E.M. and social sciences as well as humanities are what has shaped my experiences [at UCSB].""ù ""Having this opportunity to be the director, I'm able to bring in undergraduate students and expose them to research in computational science, data science and help them understand that data science is not just for people in sciences and engineering or technology and mathematics, but it's also for individuals in social sciences and humanities as a science,""ù she continued. As for what could help get more students of color into S.T.E.M. and social sciences, Tettegah believes providing exposure to these academic areas is key. ""I think it's really important to expose students to things that they may not have been exposed to, especially underrepresented groups. Because a lot of times with Black and Brown students they don't get the same exposure to S.T.E.M. at all. It's not that sometimes they might not be interested ""î they might not know about it.""ù Additionally, establishing a support mechanism early on is crucial, according to Tettegah. If a mentor can guide a student through navigating a potential interest in S.T.E.M., it helps them to see it from the ""human experience""ù rather than a ""mechanical""ù one, she said. It may help the student see beyond the hard data or facts of the field to identify the human aspects, recognizing the people behind the work to produce those data. It would be great if students end up finding an interest, but they need to have that initial exposure to it first, Tettegah continued. In the spirit of Black History Month, but also as a celebration of Black influencers in general who may not have gotten their proper due in history, Tettegah highlights the HistoryMakers project. Created by Julieanna Richardson, the HistoryMakers website features the nation's largest African American video oral history collection. With over 3,000 interviews with well-known and unsung Black influencers in all backgrounds and fields, ranging from business to medical to religion and media, the expansive archive seeks to provide a more inclusive historical record of African Americans' contributions in the United States and internationally.

science,A Study of Love: UCSB Researcher Examines Altruism in Couples,7-Mar-19,9:48 AM,['Kyle Perkovich'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/a-study-in-love-ucsb-researcher-examines-altruism-in-couples/,"What is love? Love is happiness. Love is warmth. Love is a connection you rarely have the opportunity to experience. These may be the answers you get when asking the people around you to describe this powerful emotion, but what does science say? In looking at the brain activity of people placed in altruistic scenarios with their newlywed spouse versus with strangers, Acevedo and her group found that greater patterns of activation were shown toward the partner than toward the strangers. / Courtesy of Pixabay As we are increasingly discovering, the emotions we feel every day can be traced back to pathways within our brain. Each fleeting thought or feeling is a complicated, branching trail of neurons within our head, sending chemical messages at speeds we can barely imagine. With modern research, we are learning how to trace the chemical and neural systems within ourselves responsible for the emotions we feel ""î even those as seemingly abstract as love. Bianca Acevedo, a researcher at UCSB, has worked with her team and colleagues to help uncover how our brains define love. According to a recent study, published in the Behavioral Neuroscience journal, Acevedo examined the neural basis of a concept called altruism, in which someone acts in opposition of their own self-interest so as to help someone else. From an evolutionary standpoint, altruism is generally seen as a way to protect one's own kin and help pass on genes across species. To examine human altruism in the lab, the researchers studied and compared the brain patterns of newlywed couples when faced with altruistic situations involving their partners, versus in situations involving strangers. The study tracked brain activity through a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI). The fMRI is able to track changes in soft tissue and blood flow, allowing researchers to see which regions of the brain are activated in response to different given scenarios. Thus, by studying fMRI images while participants reacted to various altruistic scenarios involving first their newlywed partners, then strangers, the researchers were able to isolate specific areas of the brain involved in the emotional processing of loved ones. This research revealed that there are key chemical differences in the way a person reacts to an altruistic situation with their partner, as opposed to one with a stranger. As Acevedo explained, ""Some of the key patterns of activation were not shown to strangers, but were shown towards the partner.""ù While certain responses were common between both groups, as with the activation of the amygdala, a region of the brain connected to emotional processing, the differences in brain activity were vital to note. ""One area that showed robust activation in response to partner emotional situations was the ventral pallidum. The ventral pallidum is an area that is important for pair bonding and attachment processes. We did not see activation there for strangers, but did for pairs.""ù This research is significant, as it helps us to better understand the complex and fascinating ways in which our brains function, allowing us to understand ourselves better than ever before. We continue to learn that everything we feel has some neural basis, and, by discovering these pathways, we can understand our brains in ways we'd never thought possible. Specifically, Acevedo believes, ""It is important that this attachment system is showing response in areas related to attachment for altruism, or what could be construed as a caregiving system.""ù We are learning more and more about how evolution has lead to a compulsion to protect our loved ones and pass on our genes. As research on the subject progresses, findings show that this process is heavily ingrained in our brain systems. In the future, Acevedo's research will explore ""studies of empathy in couples who may have a sick partner""ù, as well as ""research on the neural and genetic basis of sensory processing sensitivity.""ù She continues to work on learning about how our genes, chemicals and neurons create the traits and emotions we all have. With work like this, we hope to further isolate and dissect those areas of the brain that truly make us who we are.
Print In breaking news, UCSB researchers find that different situations (friend vs stranger) lead to different loci of activity in the brain.  Who would have thought!?   I hereby speculate that seeing different colors will lead to different activation sites in the cortex.   Science of psychology on the march.   Oh the humanity! BTW, what in the name of altruism does neural activity tell us (or anyone) about the experience of altruism?  Or is altruism conceptually reducible to trains of neural activity? To paraphrase Wittgenstein, if you have zip to say, shut the hell up.

science,Food Partitioning Allows for Fish‚'s Pacific Coexistence,7-Mar-19,1:15 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/food-partitioning-allows-for-fishs-pacific-coexistence/,"Eurich and his team's research revealed that different damselfish populations at Kimbe Bay, Paupa New Guinea, are able to coinhabit the same coral reefs through sharing food resources and switching diets to reduce competition. / Courtesy of Jacob Eurich Within the Coral Triangle in the Indo-Pacific region exists the world's greatest richness of marine species, including seven species of territorial damselfish. Also found here is the smallest scale of spatial partitioning recorded for these species, with just one or two meters separating some populations. How, scientists wondered, do these territorial fish coinhabit the same coral reefs without directly competing? The answer lays in utilizing different food sources. At Kimbe Bay, Paupa New Guinea, in the Coral Triangle, researchers used stable isotope analysis to study the damselfish diet. What an animal eats gets incorporated into its tissues. By tracking specific molecules found in potential food sources and detecting them in tissues, the scientists were able to infer the diet of these fish. ""Rather than getting a ""òsnapshot' of [the damselfishes'] diet by looking at its stomach content, you get a long-term picture of what the animal consumes on a regular basis because the food is incorporated into the animals' tissue,""ù Jacob Eurich, a UC Santa Barbara postdoctoral researcher and the lead author of the paper, said in an email. Species must consider various significant factors including food sources and level of competition when it comes to their survival. Limited resources such as habitat or food prompt animals to adapt and carve out niches. Trophic partitioning, the sharing of food resources to minimize competition, occurs commonly among most species. The researchers found that fierce competition from neighboring damselfish species forced populations to adopt this adaptation. ""An animal can't spend all of its time and energy fighting a neighbor,""ù Eurich explained. ""Instead, animals can reduce competition by using a different resource. In this study we showed some of the species switched diets to reduce competition.""ù The results of this study, ""Stable isotope analysis reveals trophic diversity and partitioning in territorial damselfishes on a low""ëlatitude coral reef,""ù published in Marine Biology, changed the researchers' knowledge of these fish. A damselfish by a coral reef in the Coral Triangle. / Courtesy of Jacob Eurich As algae-farmers, these damselfish species were thought to have reef-based diets until Eurich and colleagues found evidence of two species foraging in nearby drifting water columns. This indicated pelagic, or open-sea, feeders. Using stable isotope analysis, they discovered that those damselfish species fed on microscopic zooplankton. They also observed an intermediate omnivore group, feeding on both algae and zooplankton. This opportunistic feeding ""î when the fish's preferred food sources may not be available for various reasons including competition ""î establishes one instance of how damselfish can readily acclimate to changing conditions. Such adaptations may help explain why damselfishes flourish and proliferate while climate change and coral habitat loss cause the die-off of most species. In fact, their high success in survival has earned them the title of ""òwinners of coral bleaching.' ""Baby fish, or larvae, float around in open ocean until they are big enough to settle onto a coral reef. In most cases the habitat they settle on is the habitat that is successful (individuals that settle on bad habitats likely will not make it) and where they will spend most of their life. These species then partition habitat at an even more fine resolution and complement this with trophic partitioning ""ì or using different food sources,""ù Eurich said. Eurich and his colleagues hope to continue exploring territorial damselfish ecology in areas such as the Caribbean and Great Barrier Reef, to see whether behavior changes by region. ""The study here shows how many of these species may coexist in the future. I think it is important to look at the competition and coexistence of species that may be the most abundant on future reefs.""ù Based on these new observations of diet and habitat factoring, the study recommends recategorization of damselfishes. ""It is common to generalize what animals are doing, especially when considering how they influence our environment,""ù Eurich noted. ""However, now, more than ever, we need to remember that species that look the same may not be doing the same things.""ù More on damselfish habitat:†https://doi.org/10.3354/meps12458  More on damselfish competition:† https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2389

science,First North American Occurrence of Rare Sunfish Discovered in Santa Barbara,7-Mar-19,2:48 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/first-north-american-occurrence-of-rare-sunfish-discovered-in-santa-barbara/,"Jessica Nielson examines the seven-foot hoodwinker oceanfish that washed up on a beach in Santa Barbara. / Courtesy of Thomas Turner Holy mola. Recently a shocking, exciting discovery at the Santa Barbara beaches sent the scientific (and non-scientific) community abuzz. The hoodwinker sunfish (Mola tecta) was found at UC Santa Barbara's Coal Oil Point Reserve when it washed in with the tide. This marks the first ever sighting of this rare species in North America, and only the second in the Northern Hemisphere (The only other record of a hoodwinker in the Northern Hemisphere occurred in 1889 in Holland). The fish's identification was confirmed by Marianne Nyegaard, the world's leading expert on the hoodwinker and discoverer of this species in 2017. UC Santa Barbara staff aided in the hoodwinker's identification. Jessica Nielson, a conservation specialist at Coal Oil Point Reserve, was alerted by an intern that the stranded fish had appeared at Sands Beach. The general assumption was that it was likely an ocean sunfish (Mola mola), the only sunfish species that frequents the Santa Barbara Channel. When Nielson posted the news on the reserve's Facebook page, Thomas Turner, an associate professor in UCSB's Evolution, Ecology, and Marine Biology Department, decided to check out the sunfish up close. With his family, Turner went down to the beach. He took pictures of the unusual-looking fish and uploaded them to iNaturalist, a citizen science site which relies on crowdsourcing to identify submissions. Across the world, Ralph Foster, an ichthyologist at the South Australian Museum, saw Turner's photos in iNaturalist. ""I was extremely surprised to find that the observation came from California and not New Zealand or Australia where previous records have originated,""ù Foster wrote in an email. Foster immediately contacted his collaborator, Nyegaard of Murdoch University in Australia, to inform her of the sighting. ""Ralph and I often discuss sunfish ID on the iNaturalist platform, but this one was absolutely extraordinary because Ralph asked if I thought it could be a hoodwinker ""ì in California!! I was so absolutely totally sceptical, as I have many times before been excited by a ""òhoodwinker' sighting in the Northern Hemisphere, which then turned out to be just a Mola mola or Mola alexandrini photographed from a tricky angle,""ù Nyegaard said via email. Nielson and Turner measure the clavus of the hoodwinker. / Courtesy of Thomas Turner While the body form of the Californian sunfish looked much like that of Mola tecta, the images didn't clearly show the diagnostic features they needed to positively identify it as a hoodwinker. † ""I was therefore extremely reluctant [to identify it as a hoodwinker] and kept thinking I was being hoodwinked by this cheeky Californian fish,""ù Nyegaard continued. ""There are three species of Mola, and they can all look deceivingly similar in that they all resemble outer-space alien fish modelled over a supersized pancake with wings.""ù The sure way to tell the different Mola species apart is to check the back flap, or clavus, where a normal fish's tail is, Nyegaard explained. The hoodwinker has a distinct clavus, with a strip of smooth skin dividing the clavus into an upper and lower part. Additionally, the Mola tecta has a low number of bony structures called ossicles on the clavus, different scale structures and a slimmer size. ""As Marianne commented, the fish seemed determined not to give up its ID!""ù Foster said. ""It was Tom Turner and Jessica Nielsen of UCSB who came to the rescue. Marianne arranged for them to revisit the specimen and examine and photograph the relevant features. But this relied on them being able to relocate it after the tide receded.""ù Turner went back to the beach at night to try to find the sunfish, only to realize it had floated away on the tide. ""At this point, I'm thinking ""òoh, man, we probably had this amazing discovery and we're never going to know for sure [what it is],'""ù he said. The following day at low tide, he and Nielson started at Campus Point and Coal Oil Point, respectively, and converged. Sure enough, they found the missing fish, now at an Isla Vista beach. They took tissue samples and better-quality pictures of the mystery sunfish, which then allowed Nyegaard and Foster to definitively confirm it as a hoodwinker sunfish.  ""The wait to hear if they were successful was nerve-wracking but when the photos finally came through and the ID was beyond doubt, frustration turned to elation,""ù Foster said. ""I was sitting on the edge of my chair that day here in New Zealand trying to be calm, but when their email with photos landed in my inbox I nearly fell off my chair. It was so unbelievably exciting and incredible! The photos were super clear and unambiguous, showing the textbook Mola tecta scales and clavus ""òback-fold,'""ù Nyegaard said. Nielson takes tissue samples from the rare fish. / Courtesy of Thomas Turner Now that the fish was confirmed as a hoodwinker, the next question was how did it cross the equator and end up here? The researchers speculate about whether this was simply a lost individual but aren't sure whether this happens regularly or was a one-time event. ""We've had to revise our ideas about where the hoodwinker may occur, however,""ù Foster said. Nyegaard's research indicates a temperate distribution in the Southern Hemisphere for this species. But with the Mola tecta having been formally described just in 2017, its distribution is not yet fully understood. For now, Nyegaard will be using the tissue samples to compare the Californian hoodwinker to New Zealand hoodwinkers. With any luck, they may reveal the species' population structures, including where and when it spawns, and if gene flow exists across the regions where it is known to occur regularly (Southeast Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile and Peru). Nyegaard, Foster and Turner all said they'll be keeping a keen eye on iNaturalist after this thrilling encounter. ""The whole episode is testament to the power of citizen science and what the ""òconnectedness' of the world allows you to do,""ù Foster said. ""To be able to rapidly arrange for a re-examination of diagnostic characters on the specimen, from halfway round the world, and have them reported back in real time is fantastic. Without this ability the fish would likely have passed unrecognised.""ù For Turner, it was ""a fun, natural history discovery. It's been fascinating to see just how much interest there is in the story. It just goes to show you that people love biology, and I would encourage [people] to get on iNaturalist.""ù Nyegaard said, ""It was really quite surreal ""ì exactly 24 hours after being alerted to the existence of this fish, we had a solid ID from an impromptu collaboration between California, Australia and New Zealand. All thanks to iNaturalist and people's passion for the natural world and zest for adventure!""ù

science,The Grass is Greener,14-Mar-19,10:18 AM,['Kelly Shi'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/the-grass-is-greener/,"Climate change is the defining feature of this generation, which is currently facing a critical period before potential global catastrophe. The climate change crisis is a popular topic among politicians and scientists in media today. Some people believe that global warming does not exist, while others believe that it will not affect them in their lifetimes.  However, studies from the world's leading climate scientists suggest otherwise. The consequences of climate change are already happening ""î the world has been experiencing record heat waves, wildland fires, ozone depletion and destructive hurricanes, to name a few. Climate change also poses a risk to public goods, food supply, economic growth and global health, which are often overlooked and understudied effects of global warming.  The United Nations warned that there is only a decade left to make significant changes in order to keep ever-increasing global temperatures at bay. Top scientists hope that climate change will be treated as a challenge, one that is more about technology than politics, rather than a controversy. One focus of fighting climate change is renewable energy, which may be the key to reducing our carbon footprint. In the United States, more than a quarter of global warming emissions come from fossil fuels. The golden age of technology is upon us, which means that alternative sources must be used to fuel the electricity sector in order mitigate environmental impacts. Several types of alternative energy sources exist such as nuclear, wind and solar energy. There has also been growing interest in biofuels and ethanol, which are plant-derived substitutes for gasoline. The current focus of biofuel research is to discover more suitable biofuel crops and to improve oil yields.  Biofuel production and biodiversity conservation have been considerable topics of interest for UC Santa Barbara professor David Tilman and postdoctoral researcher Yi Yang, now at University of Minnesota. Tilman co-authored a paper with lead author Yang, which was recently published to the journal Nature Sustainability in November 2018.  The paper detailed a decade-long experiment that explored alternative ways to increase biomass production and diversity while limiting environmental impact. In theory, traditional plant-based biofuels like corn and soybeans are preferred as alternative liquid transportation sources. In practice, however, the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers to maintain these crops contribute to greenhouse gas production. ""This is where our research comes in, we explored which intensification treatment could maximize yield while having small negative environmental impacts,""ù Yang said in an email. David Tilman and researchers explore ideal conditions to grow alternative biofuels for transportation use and to limit detrimental impacts on the environment. / Courtesy of Photos-public-domain.com Yang looked towards prairie grasses grown on abandoned agricultural land as a potential bioenergy source instead. ""Our long-term goal is to create sustainable biofuels and bioenergy that not only can displace fossil fuels but also bring in other ecological and environmental benefits, like high-diversity prairie grasses,""ù Yang continued. Prairie grasses of the Midwest offer environmental benefits because they have deep roots that can store carbon, so Yang wanted to test if prairie grasses were better biofuel crops in terms of yield, too. In addition, these plants can grow on degraded agricultural land, which would minimize competition with other crops and reduce carbon emissions that result from land clearing. †† In 2007, University of Minnesota scientists planted 36 plots of 32 native prairie and savanna species in the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. The researchers divided the plots and assigned treatments in order to determine the optimal amount of water irrigation and nitrogen fertilization required to produce the greatest biomass and highest diversity. They also considered environmental factors like carbon capture and nitrate leaching.  Nitrate leaching is a process that occurs when nitrate leaves the soil and enters runoff water, polluting the environment. This directly impacts public goods, like drinkable water, and human health, particularly in the young, old and immunocompromised. Nitrate poisoning can cause anoxia, so it is important to reduce the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used. Throughout the course of the next decade, scientists discovered that moderate treatments of irrigation and nitrogen will produce the highest biomass yields and carbon storage: 89 percent more yield, 61 percent more root carbon, 187 percent more soil carbon storage and 200 percent more greenhouse gas reductions, according to the study. In contrast, the intensively treated plots resulted in greater nitrate leaching, lower greenhouse gas reduction and lower plant diversity.  ""Increasing biodiversity has many benefits, including yield improvement,""ù Yang said in an email. Although the optimal method to grow prairie grasses yielded less energy per hectare than traditional corn ethanol, the plants in this study were grown in harsher regions, captured more carbon and used less nitrogen fertilizer. Nevertheless, the promising results of this study encouraged studies tailored to different regions in order to extend these findings. ""We hope other teams would apply our idea,""ù Yang wrote. There is unequivocal evidence for global warming, and scientists like Tilman and Yang are still looking for solutions to the challenge and consequences of climate change.

science,From Apprentice to Shadow: How Intelligent Machines are Changing Learning in the Workplace,14-Mar-19,1:40 PM,['Charlotte Marston'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/from-apprentice-to-shadow-how-intelligent-machines-are-changing-learning-in-the-workplace/,"Matt Beane gives a TED Talk on how the increasing prevalence of intelligent machines is affecting on-the-job learning in various fields. / Courtesy of TED.com The word ""apprenticeship""ù may spark visions of blacksmiths and woodworkers, but the process of employing skills by assisting experts is essential to learning in many fields. Whether you're following a seasoned server and coping with tough customers and crowded shifts or piloting a complicated experiment with a veteran researcher in a lab, the best results come from your struggle combined with a mentor's guidance. Matt Beane, an assistant professor at UCSB's Technology Management Program recently gave a TED Talk†on the prevalence of intelligent machines in on-the-job learning.  His study, ""Shadow Learning: Building Robotic Surgical Skill When Approved Means Fail,""ù looked at industries where apprentices were edged out of hands-on practice by new, efficient technology.  More specifically, he observed the process of teaching medical residents surgery. Robotic surgery allows experts to perform more of the surgery alone, eliminating the need for a trainee's assistance. This has impacted the involvement and subsequently, the learning experience of on-the-job training. ""If you're my mentor and I'm a trainee, I learn because you need my help to do the job. In open surgery you'd make some big incision but then someone has to physically hold that open while the other person does the surgery. You can't do it without me and because of that I have to learn while we're doing it,""ù Beane said. This new technology has separated residents from the traditional learning process of trial, error and mentorship.  In his TED Talk, Beane emphasized the importance of struggle and expert support in learning a complex skill. This classic form of apprenticeship or mentorship has been a part of job training even before formal training was recognized.  ""Formal training is important but before that existed, it was ""òyou know how to build a building so I'm going to show up and carry stuff for you,'""ù Beane said. The integration of AI and robotic technology has been developing at a rate faster than the workplaces have adapted to it. Although the technology does provide efficient and precise work, it's preventing new workers from having the hands-on experience they need to become experts themselves. Beane delivering his TED Talk / Courtesy of TED.com This change in the learning process has been such an obstacle to the residents' skill-building that top students have had to push boundaries in order to gain the experience they need to perform surgery. They had to go out of their way to gain fluency with the robots if they stood a chance at getting sufficient experience in the operating room. Beane likens this obsessive practice to video games, saying, ""It's a year's long practice, as you start your residency you find every shred of digital practice you can do. The simulator is like playing a basic video game. You're required to do that 4 hours a year in a training program, and the people who were very successful did it say 300 hours a year. They obsessively went and tried to get the high score.""ù Extra rehearsal of skills and attempts to understand the technologies used in the operating room allow residents to be more engaged in the surgical procedure, an approach he coined as ""shadow learning.""ù Residents who become accustomed to specific technologies will be able to get more time in surgery when the senior doctor recognizes their skill ""î which is not always the most suitable method.  ""The people who get ahead are learning through methods that are viewed as inappropriate by the profession they're trying to enter,""ù Beane explained. Surgery was not the only place Beane saw this occurring, which calls for a survey of workflow in environments that are integrating intelligent machines.  ""I looked for people who were trying to design these systems in a way where you get the expert to be more efficient by using this tool and it includes or mandates that trainees are involved, but I haven't found anyone,""ù Beane said. His TED Talk strives to shed light on this issue to people involved in technology integration so that they may be able to change the course of intelligent machines in the workforce. Involving trainees in the work they one day need to teach themselves is crucial to the future of these industries ""î and to the next generation of apprentices.

science,Two UCSB Faculty Named 2019 Sloan Research Fellows,28-Mar-19,11:51 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-28/two-ucsb-faculty-named-2019-sloan-research-fellows/,"Two junior faculty from UC Santa Barbara have been selected as Sloan Research Fellows for 2019. 126 ""outstanding""ù early-career researchers chosen across eight scientific and technical fields ""ì chemistry, computer science, economics, mathematics, computational and evolutionary molecular biology, neuroscience, ocean sciences and physics ""ì will receive a two-year, $70,000 fellowship to support their research. ""Sloan Research Fellows are the best young scientists working today,""ù Adam F. Falk, president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, said. ""Sloan Fellows stand out for their creativity, for their hard work, for the importance of the issues they tackle, and the energy and innovation with which they tackle them. To be a Sloan Fellow is to be in the vanguard of twenty-first century science.""ù UCSB's Sloan Research Fellowship recipients are Thomas Sprague for neuroscience and Xin Zhou for mathematics. Courtesy of Xin Zhou Zhou, an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, joined UCSB in 2016.  His research covers geometry including differential geometry, calculus of variations and general relativity. Currently, he ""plans to continue the development of min-max theory for minimal and prescribed mean curvature surfaces and for minimal surfaces with free boundary.""ù Specifically, the main subject he studies is the mathematical model for soap bubbles.  ""When we blow out a soap bubble, ideally the enclosed volume is unchanged, and the surface will try to minimize its area by the surface tension force,""ù Zhou explained. ""For an ideal stationary soap bubble, the average of how the surface curves, called the ""òmean curvature' of the surface, is everywhere a constant number.""ù  These surfaces are called constant mean curvature surfaces, and model a class of black hole boundaries in general relativity. Such surfaces are always round spheres in flat 3-D space, but by general relativity, the space we inhabit is curved due to the existence of matter, according to Zhou. His research aims to construct these surfaces in curved 3-D or higher dimensional spaces and to better understand their behavior under various conditions.  After learning he was selected as a Sloan Fellow, Zhou was ""very glad and honored.""ù  ""This is a very prestigious award for young researchers,""ù he stated. ""I hope that earning this award can help draw more attention from people, especially graduate students, to my research field. I also wish that this may help enhance the reputation of our math department to attract more brilliant young scholars.""ù Zhou wants to thank his department and family for ""long term support of my research.""ù ""The recognition is most important to me, and it will be a big encouraging force for me to further explore my research field,""ù he said. Courtesy of Thomas Sprague The other Sloan Fellowship recipient, Sprague, joined the UCSB Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences in January 2019 as an assistant professor. His work focuses on topics related to visual cognition such as attention and working memory. Because the visual system in humans comprises 30 to 40 percent of the size of the brain, it's ""really easy to access and measure""ù this model system through noninvasive tools like fMRI and EEG, according to Sprague. ""We can build quantitative models for how different parts of the brain should respond given visual input and see if changing the kind of task a subject is doing ""ì such as if they need to attend to a part of the screen or hold something in mind for a brief working memory delay interval ""ì changes responses in a way we might not expect. We use that to improve our understanding of how cognition shapes sensory perception,""ù he said. Upon finding out he had received the award, Sprague felt ""pretty good""ù and ""really excited.""ù ""These things are very hard to predict, and you never know what one place is looking for, and so even if you're confident in the application, or even if you aren't confident, it feels sort of like a coin flip,""ù Sprague reflected. ""As much as I'd like to take any credit for the success of getting the award, I was very grateful that they saw whatever they saw in me.""ù He emphasizes that these awards reflect a collective work of many people, including his advisors, colleagues and students with which he works. Sprague plans to use the funding to ""get things off the ground.""ù It also gives him flexibility in furthering his research. ""External awards like the Sloan help me do things that I might otherwise might not have been comfortable doing given the limited resources. I anticipate moving a little bit outside of my conventional research structure""¶and moving more into naturalistic types of behavior [such as looking at natural images],""ù he said. Sloan Research Fellows are given extensive flexibility to spend the fellowship on any expensive supportive of their research.  ""What young researchers need is freedom to follow where their research leads,""ù Daniel L. Goroff, director of the Sloan Research Fellowship program at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, said. ""Find the brightest young minds and trust them to do what they do best. That is the Sloan Research Fellowship.""ù

science,To Drink or Not To Drink,4-Apr-19,1:03 PM,['Sunidhi Sridhar'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/to-drink-or-not-to-drink/,"Szumilinski's lab found a mechanism in the BNST within the amygdala that helps to regulate levels of alcohol consumption. It may explain why people may overdrink if this mechanism isn't functioning properly. / Courtesy of pixabay.com Here at UCSB, the following sequence of events is all too familiar: college student goes out on a Saturday night, college student drinks four beers in under an hour, college student wakes up Sunday morning nursing a brutal hangover. Most of us can sense when it is time to put down the handle, find our friends and make our way home. On the other hand, there are those of us who are always up for another round of Gaucho Ball, even if they are so intoxicated they cannot tell the difference between their wallet and their keys. Karen Szumlinski, Ph.D., a neuroscientist and researcher at the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, conducted a study published in The Journal of Neuroscience which investigates possible underlying brain mechanisms that may explain why certain individuals continue to drink despite signals from their bodies telling them to stop. Her team has detected a mechanism within the amygdaloid region of the brain which can be suppressed and therefore fails to properly regulate the urge to consume alcohol. ""The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, or the BNST, is part of the subcircuit in the brain that is called the extended amygdala,""ù Szumlinski explained. ""The job of the subcircuit is to regulate your emotions and your motivation in response to these emotions. People with addiction disorders have problems within their extended amygdala, and [we] have been looking particularly at alcoholism because there is such comorbidity with depression and anxiety.""ù Alcohol consumption suppresses the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, but when an individual drinks excessive amounts of alcohol, a signaling pathway in the amygdala which elevates glutamate levels in the body is activated. ""We said, ""òYou binge drink, you elevate this glutamate signaling, and that is what is driving you to drink.' That was our story for years,""ù Szumlinski noted. The BNST is one of three regions that constitute the extended amygdala and sits between the central nucleus and the nucleus accumbens. Szumlinski and her team predicted that the results of the study would closely resemble what had previously been observed in the BNST's interconnected structures ""î there would be an increase in glutamate and other metabotropic receptors. When they manipulated the brain regions in mice and had them consume alcohol, however, the results were very surprising. ""We thought that blocking the proteins should stop drinking but what we found was the exact opposite. When we blocked those molecules in the BNST, the mice actually drank more. We had never seen this before with anything. When we drink, normally, the BNST is increasing its activity as a way to put on the brakes.""ù The effects of one protein in particular stood out to Szumlinski. The levels of the Homer-2 protein, which she has been studying for years, are found to increase with binge drinking in the other two regions of the extended amygdala. When these increases were blocked, the mice stopped drinking. When the expression of the Homer-2 protein was reduced in the BNST, however, the mice continued to binge drink. ""Normally, if you are more sensitive to alcohol, you drink less. But if it takes you seven beers to get drunk, you drink seven beers,""ù Szumlinski remarked. ""There's an inverse relationship between alcohol sensitivity and alcohol consumption. Our results flew in the face of what a lot of people, including clinicians, believed.""ù The team found an explanation in an enzyme called extracellular signal-regulated kinase, or ERK. ERK plays an important role in phosphorylating glutamate receptors, which allows the Homer-2 protein to bind better. Mice that carried a mutation which affects the function of ERK were drawn towards environments where they could find alcohol. ""The animals that had the mutations showed a strong preference for the place where they got the alcohol. The control group of mice stayed the hell away from that side.""ù So what should be the major takeaway from this study, especially for college campuses, where binge drinking is so commonplace? According to Szumlinski, one fact has been made apparent. ""The bottom line is that binge drinking, even if for a relatively short period of time, causes changes in your brain. We know from other research that these changes are very long-lasting. Some of these changes within the extended amygdala can actually lead to alterations in anxiety and depression-like behavior.""ù When asked about the next step in her team's research, Szumlinski admits that while the results of her study suggest certain conclusions, there is a lot that is still unclear. ""I'm writing a grant right now to look at how genetic vulnerability or environment-induced vulnerability might relate to problems within the BNST.""ù

science,The Future of Protein?,11-Apr-19,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/the-future-of-protein/,"Burger King's recent launch of a completely meatless, plant-based ""Impossible Whopper""ù that it claims to be identical in taste to its traditional beef patty indicates that our sources of protein continue to diversify and meat alternatives are increasingly becoming mainstream. As the second-largest contributor to human-made greenhouse gas emissions (after fossil fuels) animal agriculture may have a larger environmental impact than many of us realize. While the human population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion people by 2050, demand for agricultural products is predicted to double in that same time span, the UN reports. Clearly, our rate of meat and dairy production must change. That's where companies like Good Food Institute (GFI) come in. A non-profit institute that began in 2016, GFI intends to create a ""healthy, just and sustainable food system,""ù according to its 2018 Year in Review report. Taking on a ""future perspective,""ù GFI aims to help pave the way for global implementation of alternatively sourced proteins through promoting, funding research and providing education on plant-based meat and cell-based meat, eggs and dairy. GFI features numerous departments, including one for entrepreneurship and innovation that helps people looking to start companies in this space by providing a network for them to meet with potential co-founders and get connected with investors. The organization also works to educate large food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants and ingredient companies on consumer trends and how to stock these products on their shelves or menus. ""Our mission statement is to harness the power of markets and innovation to transform the current animal agriculture system more toward plant-based and cell-based solutions. That incorporates all different aspects of how we approach this, including from a science and technology perspective. We work to assess the technological landscape and then identify the technical bottlenecks that exist such that we can communicate those to people in academia and industry to bootstrap the early stages of the research and development that needs to happen for these technologies to smoothly progress over time,""ù Elliot Swartz, an academic research advisor at GFI who recently gave a talk at UCSB, said. Plant-based meat sources the components of animal meat including proteins, fats, minerals and water directly from plants. Cell-based meat can be produced from animal stem cells. Bacterial or yeast fermentation can create various proteins, such as egg white proteins. To feed the expected 10 billion people in 2050, we need to close around a 70 percent gap in the amount of caloric content that was produced from around 10 years ago, Swartz stated. ""To feed those people, you need alternate [protein] sources as the current agricultural system leads to many negative consequences in terms of the environment,""ù he said. Switching to plant-based and cell-based foods would significantly reduce land and water use and emissions compared to their conventional animal counterparts. In fact, greenhouse gas emissions could be cut in half if the average Western diet went vegetarian, according to a study in the Climatic Change journal. Advantages of cell-based meat, also sometimes referred to as ""clean meat""ù or ""cultured meat,""ù include no animal death, no fecal contamination that could contribute to water pollution and no antibiotics. ""You don't need to use antibiotics through the process itself of producing cell-based products,""ù Swartz said. ""That should help with the prevention of antibiotic resistance as well as potentially decrease food-borne illnesses.""ù Companies like GFI are working to widely implement plant-based and cell-based meat and animal product substitutes with hopes to create a more sustainable future. Plant-based meat products such as the Impossible Burger are rapidly growing in popularity, with its product offered in various restaurants such as Burger King, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and White Castle. / Courtesy of GFI Plant-based meat has been largely available for some time now, and are a fast-growing sector in the meat market. The newer cell-based products are not yet commercially viable, though they have been taste-tested. GFI is working to make these alternatively sourced proteins readily available to the public so that they ""compete based on price, taste and convenience,""ù the three fundamental parameters upon which consumers generally make purchasing choices, Swartz said. If a plant-based or cell-based burger was next to its conventional animal counterpart in a grocery store, Swartz predicts the consumer would choose the alternatively sourced burger. ""In addition to competing in the three fundamental factors, you have no antibiotic use and a lower greenhouse gas footprint [with the plant-based or cell-based burger]. Then you can gain consumer adoption because more people ""î especially younger demographics ""î tend to select or make more conscious choices with their food and cite environmental concerns or sustainability issues when making their food choices.""ù But GFI's efforts have not gone unnoticed by the dairy industry and Cattlemen's Association, which has pushed back through lobbying efforts and state legislature bills. Over 20 bills have been brought up in state legislatures across the U.S. that act to restrict the labeling of alternate meat products. Most focus on prohibiting labeling products as ""meat""ù if they are not derived from an animal source. Swartz admits there is also a challenge in getting consumers to adopt the relatively novel technology that produces these proteins, especially cell-based ones, as the concept may ""seem unnatural or has a synthetic feel""ù to it. However, he continued, proper education may the key to larger acceptance. ""GFI is looking to get ahead of the curve in terms of education for the public as well as the regulators and the stakeholders. It can go a long way in terms of preparing people for maybe what to expect in the future and making sure that things are fairly labeled and understanding what they are.""ù Additionally, large meat companies such as Tyson and Perdue have invested in plant-based or cell-based food companies and hope to rebrand as protein companies, Swartz noted. In the short term, the consumption of animal meat products will likely continue to rise alongside an increased consumption of alternate products such as plant-based proteins. With greater demand of these alternative products over time, GFI expects consumers will make more conscious decisions driven by animal welfare or environmental issues. But despite more conscious efforts to create protein alternatives and for people to buy those alternatives, the per capita meat consumption in the U.S. continues to rise each year, with last year being the highest yet. ""We [at GFI] don't view ourselves as activists, but we do think that things can be better improved through technology,""ù Swartz said. ""Despite a large trend in increased plant-based meat consumption in the U.S. from 2017 to 2018 with about a 23 percent increase in plant-based meat sales at retail, it still makes up less than one percent in the meat market.""ù GFI is looking to 2050 as a long-term goal for ""taking a large chunk out of conventional or traditional animal agriculture industry in terms of market share.""ù ""The goal is not really to target or eliminate animal agriculture, but to provide consumers with the technology that hopefully can impact the world in a more sustainable manner and eventually that may result in a large decrease in animal agriculture.

science,You‚'re Just Too Funny For Me,11-Apr-19,1:22 PM,['Jennifer Sor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/youre-just-too-funny-for-me/,"Numerous studies suggest that men are typically perceived to be funnier than women. Evolutionary reasons may help explain this phenomenon, including that men benefit from demonstrating humor when it comes to selecting romantic partners, while women don't. / Courtesy of Pixabay The truth is, I thought I was funny until I came to college. After 18 years of my sister, my mother and my ninth-grade tennis partner leading me to think I was hilarious, my self-esteem took a fat hit. ""Honestly,""ù my friend said, a fellow Gaucho who asked to remain anonymous, ""I usually just laugh to be nice.""ù I felt my heart crack in two. ""It's nothing personal. I don't think many girls are funny in general.""ù He sounded genuinely apologetic, but from a scientific perspective, my friend's opinion is hardly surprising. He adds to a plethora of evidence ""î both empirical and anecdotal ""î indicating that men are often perceived as the funnier sex. In a 2011 study published in Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, researchers concluded that men vastly outperformed their female counterparts when asked to produce humorous content on demand. When groups of men and women were tasked with writing funny captions for a series of images, the results were what most would expect: not only did the men expend more effort in creating funny captions, but jokes written by men were consistently rated as more engaging, nuanced and, simply put, plain funnier than jokes written by women. In other circumstances, one might find this research despairing, but the Psychonomic study affirms a cultural standard that has persisted (and that women have suspected) for a long time: men are the ones who make funny jokes, women are the ones who laugh at them. After all, comedy is notoriously male-dominated, male comedians outnumbering comediennes by a ratio of three to one, according to a statistics study conducted by comedian Meredith Kachel. The reasoning behind this is two-fold. Psychologist Gil Greengross's research at the University of Wales points to evolutionary science: people may perceive men as funnier because there is a strong evolutionary advantage for men to be funny, leading men to try harder at finessing their witticisms. ""Men are willing to take more risks [in humor],""ù Greengross concludes. When considering the laws of natural selection, it isn't hard to see why. According to Newsweek's article, ""Why Humor and Intelligence Go Hand in Hand,""ù humor has been repeatedly linked to high intelligence. Dave Buss, an evolutionary psychologist from Cal, also remarks that ""[humor] requires social verve or confidence.""ù Intelligent and confident ""î is there a more killer combination? Men are the ones who make funny jokes, women are the ones who laugh at them. The same, unfortunately, can't always be said for women. While women select their romantic partners based on behavior and underlying values like intelligence, men are far more visual in their evaluation of their female partners. Men, according to Buss, are looking for specific signs of fertility in a woman rather than her intelligence ""î let alone her humor. When determining her attractiveness, having a symmetrical face, a youthful appearance and an hourglass figure far outweigh humor in importance. This is so much so that women who are funny can come across as less desirable to men, another study from Psychonomic concludes. When 100 college students were asked to rate the attractiveness of the opposite sex, women who made a humorous first impression were consistently rated as less attractive than the women who didn't. For a woman, it hurts to be funny, whereas men have it the other way around. I asked my friend to confirm. ""So, if a girl is funny ""î funnier than you ""î is that a dealbreaker?""ù He thought about it. ""I don't know. Maybe?""ù Disappointing to hear? Yes, but there is, at least, an abundance of sympathy on behalf of other funny women. In her memoir Bossypants, Tina Fey famously commented on her experience as a female comedienne: ""Practical tips for how to make it in a male-dominated workplace,""ù she quips. ""No pigtails, no tube tops. Cry sparingly.""ù Indeed, wise words to live by.

science,UCSB Researchers Find Novel Genetic Mutation for Alzheimer‚'s Disease,18-Apr-19,9:08 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/ucsb-researchers-discover-novel-genetic-mutation-for-alzheimers-disease/,"While numerous aspects ""î including age and a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors ""î influence the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, only a very small percentage of cases are caused solely by genetic inheritance. The largest known family in the world with hereditary early-onset Alzheimer's disease resides in the state of Antioquia, Colombia. The members of this family have been studied extensively for over 25 years, with efforts led by professor and co-director of UCSB's Neuroscience Research Institute Kenneth Kosik and Professor Francisco Lopera, director of the Neuroscience Group of Antioquia of the University of Antioquia's School of Medicine. This population comprises around 6,000 individuals that descended from a couple of Spaniards who settled in the 1600s in a village 100 miles north of Medell√≠n, surrounded by the Andes mountains. Around one third of the family members carry a deleterious genetic mutation and will develop Alzheimer's disease by age 65. The Colombian family carries a specific mutation in the gene that encodes Presenilin 1, or PSEN1, one of the three major genes associated with genetic Alzheimer's disease. In this family the amino acid on the position 280 changed from glutamic acid to alanine (Glu280Ala). ""Presenilin 1 is a part of the gamma secretase complex, which cuts amyloid precursor protein into fragments that your own body is able to get rid of. When you have mutations in this gene, this complex doesn't work properly, and favors the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein into amyloid beta, which forms aggregates that are called plaques and is one of the classical brain changes seen in Alzheimer's disease patients,""ù Juliana Acosta-Uribe, a graduate student researcher in the Kosik group who previously studied at the University of Antioquia's School of Medicine, said. Testing for this specific mutation, or variant, in PSEN1 allowed the researchers to find numerous branches of the extended family. Recently, a second family from the northern part of Antioquia emerged. The researchers initially thought it was part of the larger Colombian family with the Glu280Ala mutation, as this 130-person group exhibited the same autosomal dominant inheritance pattern for Alzheimer's disease and presented with similar symptoms. ""The only thing that this smaller family may have that's different [from the larger Glu280Ala family] is slightly later onset of Alzheimer's. They get dementia in their 50s versus the larger family, which gets it slightly before their 50s,""ù Acosta-Uribe said. However, the smaller family tested negative for the precise Glu280Ala PSEN1 mutation. This prompted the researchers to sequence the entire PSEN1 gene in one of the affected patients, revealing a genetic variation in which the amino acid in position 416 that is normally an isoleucine was replaced by a threonine (Ile416Thr). The lab members performed a segregation analysis to confirm that members of the smaller family who were affected with Alzheimer's disease carried that variant and that unaffected, older family members were not. ""We concluded that, indeed, this variant was segregating with the illness. If you put the segregation test with the previous knowledge of how mutations in PSEN1 are causative of Alzheimer's disease, you can conclude that this mutation, or this variant, is pathogenic,""ù Acosta-Uribe said. A second Colombian family with a novel mutation on the same gene for inherited Alzheimer's disease had been discovered. The remarkable finding is documented in a new paper appearing in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia. UCSB researchers report a second large family with a genetic variant for Alzheimer's Disease also living in the state of Antioquia, Colombia. They traced the genetic mutation back to African ancestors. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons While the two families are neighbors today, identity-by-descent analysis revealed that the two families' genetic variations originated on different continents. The larger family's PSEN1 Glu280Ala mutation came from a Spanish ancestor, believed to be from when European settlers came to America in the 16th century. The researchers traced the other, smaller family's genetic mutation back to African ancestors, which correlated with the historic registries of African slaves in the region. Colombia's rich history supports this conclusion: Beginning in the early 16th century, Spanish conquistadors arrived in the New World and brought over West Africans as enslaved laborers. Both groups mingled with the native populations, resulting in mixed demographics, which are still reflected in present-day Colombian demographics. ""When you look at the genomes of Latin-American people, you can find genetic signature of different ancestries in different haplotype blocks, which are the segments, or ""òchunks' of your DNA that you inherited together from your mother or from your father,""ù Acosta-Uribe explained. ""[For the smaller family], we looked at the ancestry surrounding that part of the mutation. We saw that there were other variants close to our variant of interest that were only reported in African populations ""¶ So that is how we concluded that the mutation had to have happened in the context of an African haplotype.""ù Working with the larger family for over two decades now, the Kosik lab has done intensive follow-up for Alzheimer's disease patients through the entire process of growing up, getting early onset Alzheimer's disease and dying from the disease. The researchers have registered over 1,500 carriers of the mutation so far. Studying Alzheimer's disease in these families has helped to improve understanding of the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, before the patients begin experiencing memory issues. It permits close observation and study of the changes occurring as an affected person's healthy state transforms to a state of dementia, including how neurons begin to degrade, how amyloid plaques builds up and how the brain responds to this plaque accumulation. Work with these families also allows for preventative clinical trials and may help to develop preventative drugs. ""In the future, people who know they have relatives affected by this form of genetic Alzheimer's could get specific testing and genetic counseling to decide if they want to have babies or if they want to do any sort of in vitro method,""ù Acosta-Uribe stated.

science,There Are Not Plenty of Fish in the Sea,18-Apr-19,1:06 PM,['Kelly Shi'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/there-are-not-plenty-of-fish-in-the-sea/,"UC Santa Barbara postdoctoral researcher Christopher Free studies the effects of global warming on fish productivity in an effort to prevent overfishing and adopt sustainable fishery practices. / Courtesy of iStock ""There are plenty of fish in the sea.""ù This commonly heard idiomatic expression is starting to develop into an ironic saying as the impending climate catastrophe threatens fish populations around the world. Wild-caught and farmed seafood is the largest traded commodity in the world, and fish remains a primary source of protein for about half of the world's population today, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Climate change is affecting fish ecosystems and will undoubtedly pose a risk to both the future food supply and economic growth, as fisheries are crucial to food security and poverty alleviation. According to the United Nations, 97% of fishers are in developing countries, so the industry is a significant source of livelihood for billions of people. The future of fish is an important issue as our generation is ushered into an era of climate change-induced consequences . In order to prevent overfishing and resource depletion, scientists like UC Santa Barbara's Christopher Free are researching global fishery reform, sustainable aquaculture, marine biodiversity protection and more. Free, a postdoctoral researcher in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, led a study on the impacts of warming waters on fishery production. The results were recently published in the journal Science in March 2019. Current burdens on fisheries include stock overfishing and poor management, with climate change soon to be added to the list. Free and a team of scientists used temperature-dependent population models to compare records of ocean temperature to abundance data for 124 species in 38 different ecoregions. ""For the data available, we documented how temperature has either benefitted or negatively impacted populations,""ù Free said. The investigation also assessed how the ability of fish populations to provide food has changed, according to historical data from 1930 to 2010. Out of a total of 235 fish populations, 8% were negatively impacted and 4% were positively impacted by global warming. Free and other scientists used their model to hindcast temperature-driven changes in maximum yield, which showed a 4.1% decline in the food provisioning potential of fish populations since 1930. The paper also forecasted ""winning""ù and ""losing""ù ecosystems under warming waters, in which certain regions of the world would experience a loss of fish diversity and availability. This study observed significant regional disparities in food availability. The data showed that East Asian ecoregions showed some of the largest temperature-driven losses in fish productivity. These are the same regions that support the largest human populations in the world. Tropical developing countries, which are seeing large increases in human population and demands for food, will also experience loss in food availability. Free's findings highlight the importance of proper fishery management in the future to account for changing productivity and biodiversity as the ocean warms. This entails the development of new tools to observe fish populations, new strategies to avoid overfishing and new arrangements to distribute fish around the world. ""There are many other factors that are definitely influencing productivity,""ù Free said. Some of these additional factors include ocean acidification, falling oxygen levels and habitat loss ""î areas where further research is required. Overall, Free believes that two of the most important levers we have for mitigating the impacts of warming on fish populations are to prevent overfishing and to develop sustainable fishery management practices. ""I'm really interested in understanding more of the mechanisms by which climate change is affecting fish populations and using that information to design strategies that are adaptive and responsive to climate change,""ù Free said. His next steps include thinking about ways to set fishery catch limits that are adaptive to changing productivity and how to use marine-protected areas to buffer the impacts of climate change. Fish represent an important input in our society because they both feed and employ people. Many fish ecosystems will be disrupted as ocean waters warm and many regions will have less food as a result. Free's findings emphasize the consequences of climate change, and he urges us as a society to reduce greenhouse gas production in order to protect a vital source of livelihood for people around the world.
Print Fish farming is pointed to as a solution but it's actually a huge part of the problem. In addition to many of the wild-caught fishes being used as food for farmed fishes (and chickens, pigs and shrimps), it is a big source of water pollution and disease/parasite transmission to wild fishes. It is also extremely inhumane. What should be done is encouragement of everyone who doesn't need to consume aquatic (and other) animals as an absolute matter of survival (i.e., the vast majority of people) to opt instead for a vegan diet, which could also be a great boon for""¶†Read more ª

science,Exploring Mental Health Through the Art of Film,25-Apr-19,8:45 AM,['Sunidhi Sridhar'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/exploring-mental-health-through-the-art-of-film/,"Leslie Poston, a program facilitator for Art With Impact, facilitates a discussion during the ""Movies for Mental Health""ù event. / Courtesy of UCSB Active Minds The shift from high school to college is often seen as an important milestone filled with exciting opportunities on the horizon, but for many students, this period of transition can be difficult to navigate. Between the unrelenting stress of exams and the continual barrage of extracurricular and social commitments, these years can take a heavy toll on students' emotional and mental well-being. While mental health awareness has been spreading on college campuses and people are now able to have more open conversations about their experiences, there is still a lot of lingering stigma surrounding the subject. Active Minds, a nonprofit organization with a chapter here at UCSB, is an advocacy group dedicated to raising awareness and promoting healthy discussions about mental health in order to demystify common misconceptions about depression, anxiety and other common disorders. Recently, Active Minds hosted an event on campus called ""Movies for Mental Health,""ù where several short films about various mental illnesses were screened for an audience of students and attendees from the Isla Vista community. These films, all under five minutes in length, were submitted as part of a monthly contest put on by Art With Impact, an organization that addresses mental health issues through art and media. One feature titled ""A Short Film About Anxiety,""ù directed by London-based filmmakers Lily Rose Thomas and Stephen Isaac-Wilson, particularly resonated with fourth-year biopsychology major Cody Brink. ""It is something that is hard to put into words, and things can be communicated a little bit differently through film,""ù Brink reflected. ""The fact that the [cast] was filming themselves in their own personal space, rather than someone recording them ""î the cinematography makes the film feel like it wasn't scripted.""ù ""It was nice to see that, through their struggle, all of them were eager to share the things they had learned and their experiences living with [anxiety]. They have been getting the help that they need, and everyone should get the help that they need.""ù UCSB Active Minds' recent event, ""Movies for Mental Health,""ù screened several short films provided by Art With Impact about various aspects of mental health and featured four student speakers who spoke out about their personal mental health experiences. / Courtesy of UCSB Active Minds The two-hour-long event also featured a student-led panel in which four UCSB undergraduates courageously shared their personal struggles with mental health. They also focused on the resources and outlets they turned to during their most trying times. Second-year biopsychology major Arianna DiRomualdo, one of the panelists, spoke highly of her experiences in therapy and highlighted the incredible difference that the sessions made on her overall well-being. ""Therapy is not easy, but everyone should go. It's an amazing experience. I call it a journey because it is not linear ""î you go up and down and off the path and everywhere. No matter what, I'm always farther than where I started. Ever since I started therapy, I've learned to cope with my feelings better. It's been tough, but I've found my support and my people,""ù she said. Another panelist, third-year econ and accounting major Evelyn Gutierrez, commented on the stigmas more prevalent in certain cultures and the barriers these stigmas can pose. People who come from more conservative backgrounds may be more hesitant to seek treatment. For example, some cultures pride themselves on emotional self-control and mental perseverance and therefore view mental illness as a source of shame, she said. Gutierrez, however, feels like she has found a tight-knit community through Active Minds. ""There can be a lot of cultural stigma, but surrounding myself with people who have had similar experiences helps me be able to talk more freely about mental health. Having access to the resources and being able to get help ""î yes, it's a roller coaster ""î allows me to accept that the bad is going to be here but there is always going to be good,""ù Gutierrez shared. Under the pressures of college and early adult life, mental health issues may either become accelerated or present themselves for the first time. While it can be daunting to take the first step and reach out for help, advocates at Active Minds want students to know that there are several resources available both on and off campus. UCSB's Counseling and Psychological Services is located across the Arts Building on campus and offers both short-term and long-term individual counseling, as well as the Mental Health Peer Program, in which students are trained to address and advocate for the emotional well-being of their peers. There are several counseling and treatment centers located throughout Goleta and Santa Barbara as well. Leslie Poston, a program facilitator for Art With Impact, wants people who are struggling to come to terms with their emotions to know that mental illnesses do not discriminate. ""Mental illness does not sound like something that affects people who are established or married with a house and kids, but that's not true. It does not stop with accomplishment or age.""ù Active Minds can be reached at ucsbactiveminds@gmail.com.

science,UCSB Researchers Investigate Factors Affecting Gasoline Price Variability in Santa Barbara County,25-Apr-19,1:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/ucsb-researchers-investigate-factors-affecting-gasoline-price-variability-in-santa-barbara-county/,"California's average gasoline prices are the highest in the country at slightly above $4 per gallon compared to the national average of around $2.85 per gallon, as reported by the American Automobile Association. While several primary components ""î crude oil prices, taxes and refining and distribution costs and profits ""î reliably predict national and state gas prices, nuanced factors specific to neighborhoods may impact regional gas pricing. Adopting a more local viewpoint, UC Santa Barbara geographers explored spatial and other significant features affecting gas price variability in Santa Barbara County. They also sought to explain underlying factors behind unusual pricing practices in the region. ""Motivating the study was really trying to understand and explain variability in gas prices that we see, both in Santa Barbara and more broadly in the county,""ù Alan Murray, a professor of geography, said. Jing Xu, a graduate student researcher in the Department of Geography, co-authored a paper with Murray that appears in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science. Using the real-time tracking app GasBuddy, the researchers collected volunteer geographic information of daily gas prices at 108 gas stations in Santa Barbara County over a two-week study period. The two developed a spatial analytic framework which integrated remote sensing, geographic information science and spatial regression techniques to assess gas price variations between stations. ""The market competition is definitely the first factor that will affect gas prices,""ù Xu said. ""Spatial factors we found [to be important include] gas station density within a 2.5-mile radius and the distance from a station to its nearest competitor station. These factors significantly affect the gas price statistically in terms of typically decreasing price with more competition.""ù Additionally, the presence of a nearby store or car wash service resulted in lower prices. In urban areas with high gas station density, gas prices were typically lower than in more rural areas or those near the urban fringe, which observed low market competition. The researchers found that major gas brands such as Mobile, Shell and Chevron drove up prices, with a 32-cent-per-gallon difference higher than prices at minor brand retailers. And indeed, as we all might have presumed, station proximity to activity hotspots including shopping centers, school districts and major roads, freeways and highways influence gas prices. Gas stations closer to these hotspots often charged higher prices. ""If a gas station is closer to a school district or a shopping mall, it's going to have higher gasoline prices to take advantage of the fact that people are usually going to fill up their tanks on the road when they're doing other things,""ù Xu explained. Looking at Santa Barbara County, Xu and Murray found in their study that factors including market competition and urban areas with more gas stations tended to drive down gas prices. Major-name brands and stations near activity hotspots often charged higher prices. / Courtesy of Pixabay A major second interest in performing the study was to find pricing outliers, according to Xu. In particular, they identified three gas stations ""î in Carpentaria, Santa Ynez and Goleta ""î with higher gas prices compared to the average prices other stations in the county offered. Convenient station access and low market competition help to explain this phenomenon. ""The most interesting one is the Mobile near exit 108 of [U.S. Route] 101. That one sells gasoline at the price of $4.79 per gallon compared to the average price of about $2.80 per gallon in the whole county during our two-week study period. That's about 68 percent higher than the average of the gas stations, so that one is really significant,""ù Xu said. In their study, Xu and Murray found that the Mobile station at the intersection of Storke Road and Glen Annie Road was the biggest outlier in the entire county. Situated near the freeway and popular areas including Camino Real Marketplace and Isla Vista, the station can take advantage of its prime location through price-gouging behavior. The California Department of Transportation's daily observed transportation numbers show that Storke Road receives nearly double the average amount of traffic per intersection in the county annually, Xu stated. This particular Mobile is also the last major-name gas station before Solvang when traveling north on the 101 freeway. In their paper, the researchers concluded that spatial factors do play a significant role in gas price variation ""î at least in their area of study. Their work ""offers a first attempt""ù at analyzing the spatial factors associated with gas pricing outliers, in hopes of encouraging ""government agencies, urban planners and policy makers with capabilities to investigate regional gasoline price variation and potential gouging behavior.""ù ""Spatial advantage dictates, which isn't really a big surprise,""ù Murray said. ""But in this case, it's a bit more so than you would expect. In particular, the Mobile's prices are much higher than some nearby competitors and it appears to be a function of the traffic volume but also proximity and who some of those drivers are ""î students going to UCSB. Storke Road has a lot of traffic, or certain kinds of students in particular [including] graduate students and maybe upper-division students that live in parts of Goleta.""ù ""There could be aspects of taking some advantage of particular socioeconomic or particular kinds of groups. You have [Dos Pueblos] High School in the area and you have a less affluent residential area in proximity to that particular station,""ù he added. From onsite observations, the researchers noted that while the Mobile station charged distinctly higher prices, overall, less traffic volume passed through. Most drivers who stopped at the station either only bought items from the convenience store and left or simply left without purchasing gas. This led the researchers to think about their potential next steps. One idea could be to acquire more information on traffic volumes and other activities to better understand the relationship to pricing behavior, according to Murray. ""If we could, it would be quite interesting to look at some issues of volume and the degree to which pricing seems to be influenced by levels of volume, in addition to spatial issues. Relative to the study [especially in regards to the Mobile outlier], this issue of total sales and volume and the degree to which people are working profitability margins will be particularly interesting,""ù he said.

science,UCSB‚'s Bridge to the Doctorate Program,2-May-19,10:32 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/ucsbs-bridge-to-the-doctorate-program/,"† The 12 Bridge to the Doctorate fellows meet with the program's directors, Javier Read de Alaniz and Arica Lubin. / Courtesy of Bridge to the Doctorate Program Sponsored by the National Science Foundation's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, the Bridge to the Doctorate program at UCSB has chosen 12 doctoral students to support from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program aims to ""enhance the diversity of STEM graduate education by recruiting, enrolling, training and graduating a cohort of 12 talented doctoral students,""ù its website says. BD fellows receive financial support for the first two years and assistantship support for the remaining time. They also have opportunities for graduate student mentorship and leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (S.T.E.M.) communities, professional development and career preparation and academic support through workshops for technical writing of reports and papers. ""I was over the moon when I found out I was chosen as a BD fellow,""ù Lourdes Velazquez, a first-year Ph.D. student in the biomolecular science and engineering program, said in an email.""I still find it hard to believe that I have such amazing opportunities. Because my path has been very nonlinear, being chosen as a BD fellow reaffirmed my confidence in moving forward with a Ph.D. program.

""Prior to grad school, I had been studying biophysics with [physics] professor Deborah Fygenson for about ten years. Although I very much enjoy the field, it's the only research I've ever known. For this reason, I decided to use my rotations as an opportunity to branch out to other fields, learn new techniques and see what else I enjoyed,""ù Velazquez wrote. Aside from fostering professional connections, including through arranging conference participation and connecting fellows with peers and professors in their departments, the BD program helps to form a more personal support system. ""The BD program has been such a wonderful experience,""ù Velazquez continued. ""They support and help coordinate socials for the BD fellows which ultimately means we get to know each other well and gain a group of friends.

Although unable to come to UCSB for his undergraduate years, Reyes is ""pretty excited, pretty stoked""ù about being able to earn his Ph.D. at one of his ""dream schools.""ù Courtesy of Marcos Reyes ""I've been exposed to way more than I could even believe.

Being exposed to other S.T.E.M. majors like chemistry, engineering, bio, we all just talk about science and help each other talk about science. Like ""òyou need help on Fourier analysis? I know that. I did a project on it.' It's just nice to be exposed to different areas of S.T.E.M.,""ù Reyes said. Part of the math department's Directed Reading Program (DRP), Reyes works with undergrads to help them ""learn about areas of math that are not standard in classes,""ù such as knot theory. At the end of the program, mentees present their research projects. Reyes initially aspired to be a high school teacher, recalling his own high school teacher encouraging him to teach math. ""[The math] was interesting and he taught it in a funny way ""¶ he put a nice flavor to it,""ù he said. Reyes now aims to teach at a four-year college because it has a ""different vibe.""ù He wanted to ""try to find a different route where I do the same thing but people appreciate you [more], so that's where I'm at now.""ù ""In university, it's more of a relaxed environment,""ù he explained. ""I would play tennis with my undergraduate professors and it was a crazy environment. I felt like I wanted to be one of those people, one of those teachers for the students. That's why I chose this route and it worked out ""î it's working.""ù A first-generation college student, Roman Aguilera is now second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science. ""I was really excited when I got [the BD program]. I was very grateful because it's not easy to get funding for a graduate student without doing a TAship or fellowship,""ù he said. Aguilera found that the flexible research component of the BD program allowed him to ""approach pretty much any type of research [he] wanted on campus.""ù ""The fact that I was able to do computer science and I got the BD Fellowship pretty much seemed that I was very unconstrained in what I could possibly do. It felt like a very overwhelming thing but it's been more of a blessing, in my opinion,""ù he said. Aguilera's main research interests are machine learning and robotics, particularly in the area of reinforcement learning. His work aims to increase robots' agility and awareness of the environment, and to get them to interact with the environment in a more intelligible way. Courtesy of Roman Aguilera While he took an artificial intelligence class in his fourth year of undergrad at UC San Diego that ""naturally drew [his] attention""ù and further encouraged him to pursue machine learning, Aguilera found that he personally did not have many role models in science and engineering. ""There would be a lot of people that I couldn't relate to [in my math classes during my undergrad days]. I had to be comfortable in a setting where I didn't feel like I belonged. So I think that's made me very strong in that sense.""ù Since coming to graduate school, the feeling of being out of place has ""increased tenfold,""ù Aguilera reflected. ""There's a lot fewer minorities in that sector. Nowadays the thought [of not feeling like I belong] still lingers there but it's not as intense. For me, you have to figure out what to do in certain situations where you feel like you don't belong. There's always a certain club like National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) or SACNAS [Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science] ""î very small communities that are usually very there for you because they can share that same sentiment. So it's also a blessing as well because it gives you a community that will always be there for you.""ù That's one reason why joining the BD program means so much to Aguilera. ""It's also given me the opportunity to be part of a cohort,""ù he said. ""Part of the cohort's very diverse. You have people from statistics, you have people from biology, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering ""î all very broad areas.""ù While he finds it ""very easy to socialize with people""ù within his own department, being a BD fellow has allowed Aguilera to become familiar with people from other departments. ""It's a good way to hear about what else is going on on campus, what's going on with other fellows' lives. It gives us the opportunity to be a cool group of aspiring young scientists that are all going down the same path, though each department has its own different things. It's also given me an opportunity to network with other people that may have some expertise in an area that I need. And maybe sometimes I need to help someone else with some type of coding resource, teach them how to code or something like that,""ù Aguilera said. ""I'm very grateful for the Bridge to Doctorate fellowship. I hope opportunities like this can be more available to others.""ù

science,Ecosystems of the Santa Barbara Channel,9-May-19,9:30 AM,['Cristian Loza'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/ecosystems-of-the-santa-barbara-channel/,"Last week, Valentine gave a talk about the unusual ecosystems found around oil seeps around the California coast. His presentation is related to the exhibition about the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. / Courtesy of Cristian Loza Last Wednesday, UCSB professor of Earth science and biology David Valentine held a presentation to discuss the ecosystems of oil in the Santa Barbara Channel. ""The Pacific Plate is gradually sliding past the North American Plate, and it's tearing off pieces of the North American continent. In the course of that activity, what happens is the formation of a borderland with lots of valleys and ridges that separate basins from one another,""ù Valentine, of the Department of Earth Science and Marine Science Institute, said. A lot of Valentine's work revolves around studying these valleys and ridges that have been created in the last 20 million years, with a focus on the study of three local basins. ""A basin is basically a geological bathtub. The first is the Santa Barbara Basin, and it's about 2,000 feet deep. It's a sealed basin, meaning the bottom portion of it is restricted from the ocean,""ù Valentine said. According to Valentine, the neighboring Santa Monica and San Pedro basins are about 3,000 feet in depth. Because of the depth of these geological underwater bathtubs, they must be explored by using very specific tools. Valentine went on to describe four of his team's primary research tools, each engineered to perform a specific task. According to the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institution, the research vessel Atlantis is owned by the U.S. Navy and is one of the most sophisticated research vessels to date. The Atlantis is outfitted to deploy Alvin, a human-occupiable submersible dedicated to getting up to three researchers as close of a look as possible, down to ""a depth of around 14,000 feet,""ù according to Valentine. The second vehicle utilized aboard the Atlantis would be the Jason research vehicle, which, according to Valentine, is remotely operated from the ship and is tethered to the Atlantis. ""It has all the same capabilities as the Alvin, except there is just no person in it,""ù Valentine said. Finally, the third vehicle is the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Sentry. ""It is a vehicle you drop into the water, and it goes off and does its thing. It is preprogrammed to do whatever it is you told it to do over the course of the day,""ù Valentine said. According to Valentine, Sentry's biggest primary use is for the mapping of the ocean floor at high resolution and for mass image collection. ""It flies about nine feet off the seafloor, and often in a dive it will take about 30,000 to 50,000 images of the seafloor,""ù Valentine said. The images can then be reconstructed for three-dimensional renderings of the seafloor. Photo by Reena Nanavati Using the AUV, Valentine had the idea to create a continuous map from the bottom of the Santa Barbara Basin up to the surface of the ocean. Since the basin receives little to no circulation from the ocean, ""it's basically a closed bathtub,""ù Valentine said. Because of the lack of circulation, there is little to no oxygen at the bottom of the basin, meaning there is also little to no life. The goal of the mapping was to demonstrate what happens to the sea life as the amount of oxygen increases going upward or decreases going downward. But Valentine came across two issues when reviewing the 30,000-plus images that were taken: Not only were the images lower quality than expected due to the darkness of the seafloor, but ""there was a one-mile stretch of images that were pure white,""ù Valentine said. After further research, ""the white""ù was found to be bacterial mats that were using nitrate instead of oxygen to survive. This is because the water where the bacteria was located was found to have no oxygen in it whatsoever. Valentine speculated that the reason the bacteria was found at that exact depth was that any higher and there would be enough oxygen to support predators and any deeper there would be no nitrate for the bacteria to survive. As the Sentry traveled upward, it came across an underwater feature that was about 60 feet high and 400 feet across. After some evaluation, Valentine concluded that this feature would be something worth investigating further. After the deployment of the Alvin submersible, it was discovered that the entirety of the underwater feature was made of tar. ""What made this interesting was that the seafloor around it was coated in sediment. When you have a sediment-coated seafloor, there isn't a place for larger organisms to take root. Having a mound like this provided hard substrate for a tremendous amount of diversity,""ù Valentine said. In terms of the dating of these tar mounds, Valentine noted there is nothing specific within the tar's chemical makeup that allows for this. Instead he and his colleagues decided to take an alternate route that would allow for an accurate dating process. ""We looked at the microfossils, the organisms that were in the sediment that got incorporated into the tar. What we saw was that this feature was put into place about 40,000 years ago,""ù Valentine said. ""Bizarre ecosystems, fluid flow, unusual anaerobic communities and mount structures""ù are just a few of the wonders that can be found within our Santa Barbara Channel.

science,"The ‚""òInvisible‚' Pollution of Plastics",9-May-19,1:30 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-09/the-invisible-pollution-of-plastics/,"While many of us know about the harmful effects of plastics on marine ecosystems, including marine life getting snagged in plastic debris or ingesting microplastics, less apparent are their contributions to the air and climate change. To get a more comprehensive understanding of greenhouse gas emissions that plastics produce, UC Santa Barbara researchers performed the first global-scale study focusing on the impact of plastics on climate change. Their findings have been published in the Nature Climate Change journal. Zheng's study is the first to look at the greenhouse gas emissions of plastics production on a global scale. Today 99% of plastics are synthesized from fossil fuels, and even their end-of-life management is carbon-intensive. / Courtesy of Pixabay ""Some people are focusing on the fate and transport of plastics like in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the Pacific Ocean. To me, these are all the ""òvisible' pollution which is, of course, very important, but relatively less attention is paid to the ""òinvisible' pollution, which are emissions from the whole supply chain of plastics,""ù Jiajia Zheng, a graduate student in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and the lead author of the study, said. ""That got me interested in how large of a scale plastics contribute to climate change, and I decided to do a model myself to find out how large the problem is.""ù With the abundance of plastic products in our daily lives, it can be easy to overlook where they have come from and to fully realize their environmental impact. ""Plastics seem very simple ""î a bag, a bottle. But actually they've gone a long way to serve our lives,""ù Zheng said. Today 99% of plastics manufactured are synthesized from fossil fuels including coal, crude oil and natural gas, according to Zheng. Take a simple plastic bag, for example. Its life cycle begins with the extraction of petroleum, which is then distilled and processed in refineries to produce ethylene. These fossil fuel-derived monomers are polymerized in a polymer manufacturing plant ""î emitting more greenhouse gases ""î to form low-density polyethylene (LDPE), resulting in the characteristic plastic bags we use. ""It's gone a long way. It's a long process. And after that, we only use the bag for a couple of hours or probably one to two days and then we throw it away,""ù Zheng said. The plastic bag will likely end up at a landfill, where the majority of plastics are fated. In fact, the recent influential study from Roland Geyer, a professor of industrial ecology also in UCSB's Bren School, found that 79% of plastic waste we produce globally ends up in landfills. Only 9% of all plastics ever produced were recycled in 2015. The remaining option for end-of-life management of plastics is incineration, which was at 12% in 2015. Even these end-of-life processes add carbon emissions. The researchers found that plastic production has increased dramatically in the past six decades. Between 1950 and 2015, the production rose from zero to over 400 million metric tons, with an annual growth rate of 8.4%. The annual increase was 4% between 2010 and 2015. Looking forward, the researchers expect to see a continued rising trend of around 4-5%, especially as residents of numerous developing countries still require the usage of plastics in their daily lives. If these oil consumption and plastics production trends continue at their current rate, plastics will account for 20% of our total oil consumption by 2050. In their paper, Zheng outlined four strategies to curb emissions from plastics, including reducing the growth in demand for plastic. Potentially the most effective strategy, according to Zheng, would be to decarbonize the entire energy system in the plastics supply chain. ""If we replace the current energy with 100% renewables like wind or energy or biogas rather than fossil fuels, we would see a 50% [to 75%] reduction from where we are now.""ù Another mitigation strategy she proposed is the replacement of fossil fuel-based plastics with bio-based plastics, derived from plants such as corn or sugarcane. Recycling also plays an important role role in reducing the carbon-intensive polymer production and decrease emissions levels from incineration. ""If all four strategies can be combined together so that we're using a multi-layered strategy, we can see emissions have a reduction of as much as 93% compared to the baseline in 2015,""ù Zheng said. The paper acknowledges that a 100% recycling or conversion to renewable energy may not be ""practical nor economically feasible in reality,""ù but the urgent message behind their strategies remains clear. Zheng concluded, ""The carbon emissions from the plastic supply chain are enormous. If we do nothing, this dramatic rise will [continue to] happen. We should adopt an integrated strategy to tackle this challenge ""î and to do it fast.""ù

science,Recapping Undergraduate Research Week,16-May-19,9:30 AM,['Sunidhi Sridhar'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/recapping-undergraduate-research-week/,"During the event-filled Undergraduate Research Week, students showcased their research projects at either the Math, Life and Physical Sciences or the Social Sciences, Humanities and Fine Arts colloquiums. They also had the chance to participate in the Undergraduate Research Slam. ANDREA VERDUGO / DAILY NEXUS Every year, the UC system is inundated with hundreds of thousands of applications from prospective freshman and transfer students. In addition to the stellar academic programs and career prospects after graduation, students cite one aspect in particular as a major draw: research. Here at UC Santa Barbara, research plays an intrinsic role at the undergraduate level; over 56% of UCSB undergraduates are involved in research. Undergraduate Research Week, which took place from May 6 to May 10, was a culmination of students' hard work and dedication to their research projects over several quarters. Over the course of two days, students showcased their findings at one of two colloquiums ""î Math, Life and Physical Sciences, or Social Sciences, Humanities and Fine Arts ""î to their fellow peers and faculty members. These undergraduate researchers were also eligible to apply to be a part of this year's Undergraduate Research Slam. ANDREA VERDUGO / DAILY NEXUS This annual event invites students to present their findings in three-minute speeches, resembling an elevator pitch, to a panel of judges. 50 students took part in the preliminary round, from which the top 15 participants advanced to the final round. The top three finalists receive research grants worth up to $2,500. This year, the final round took place on May 9 at the Old Little Theater. One finalist, Kat Sitnikova, a fourth-year environmental studies major, presented her research on composting around Isla Vista. ""Most people in Isla Vista don't have a choice but to put their food in the trash, which eventually goes to the landfill. When food gets piled in the trash, it loses access to oxygen. When it biodegrades in anaerobic conditions, it produces landfill gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.""ù Sitnikova acknowledged that while composting does require significant time and effort, she wants to educate people on its importance for the wellbeing of the planet. She highly endorses Isla Vista Compost Collective, a student-run organization that gives students compost buckets, shows them what is and is not compostable and picks up the food waste weekly. ""I surveyed 180 students living in Isla Vista and I found that while only 11% of them compost, more than half showed interest in receiving a compost bin,""ù Sitnikova explained. ""I want to understand the factors that encourage participation but also the factors that make students hesitant to participate. I surveyed 46 participants in order to understand the weaknesses and strengths of the program. I'm hoping that this research will be useful in determining how to create campaigns that will encourage people to participate and also make it easy for them to do so.""ù Fellow finalist Alexander Landry, fourth-year psychological & brain sciences major, conducted a social science survey in which he looked at the psychological impact of the 2016 presidential election on Americans. ""Those who were stressed by the results felt that the world had become more unfair, and they were less optimistic about the future. We also found that those who experienced stress during the election had lasting stress symptoms on a scale designed to measure PTSD.""ù Landry's findings inspired a different question: How did Americans cope with the stress? He found that people tended to frame their experiences in one of two contrasting ways. One of the participants in Landry's study stated, ""I felt optimistic about this country, but then the election happened. I was disgusted, depressed and shocked.""ù Another participant admitted that while seeing Trump get elected was difficult, ""good people are trying to come together and fight against all his hate and vitriol.""ù People who viewed the results of the election with the mindset of the latter participant tended to report a higher overall wellbeing and no lasting stress symptoms related to the election. ANDREA VERDUGO / DAILY NEXUS Fourth-year linguistics major Anusha Anand explored the social significance of media portrayal of minorities, specifically the portrayal of the Indian accent. She noted that Apu from ""The Simpsons""ù is often called to mind when people think of Indian stereotypes, but most viewers do not know that the character is voiced by white actor Hank Azaria. ""Growing up Indian American, when I think of the Indian accent in a humorous context, my mind goes here,""ù Anand observed as she played a video of YouTube star Superwoman imitating her parents. ""Through a series of focus groups, I asked some questions to Indian American teens in the Bay Area. I asked them what they thought of Superwoman's reenactment of the Indian accent, and the responses were overwhelmingly positive. One of the participants even demonstrated how she imitates her own parents. Both Superwoman and the teenagers in the focus groups were joined by their shared experiences of growing up Indian American with Indian parents. So the question we need to be asking is, ""òWhy do we imitate the Indian accent?' ""ù Anand admits that the line between empowering portrayals and offensive portrayals of minorities in the media will never be entirely clear because no singular person can speak on behalf of an entire community. However, the responses she received through her focus groups allowed for her to reflect on her question in a different way. ""I did find for certain that with Indian Americans, the question of who can do the Indian accent is a lot less based on restriction by appearance but on the celebration of a unique shared experience.""ù With every discovery, a new question emerges in its place, and the importance of innovative research cannot be overstated. In addition to being an excellent enhancement to any resume, it teaches students how to defend a statement with viable data and strong conclusions and how to translate their findings in a way that can be understood by the public. Boasting six Nobel Laureates and 12 National Research Centers, UC Santa Barbara is making remarkable contributions to the academic world every year, and Undergraduate Research Week celebrates the vital role undergraduate students play within UCSB's research community.

science,UCSB Researchers Discover Potentially Druggable Pathway Involved in Neurodegenerative Diseases,16-May-19,1:30 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/ucsb-researchers-discover-potentially-druggable-pathway-involved-in-neurodegenerative-diseases/,"Abnormal aggregates of the tau protein are pathological characteristics of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's and Alzheimer's. Tau mutations often lead to frontotemporal dementia. Researchers at UCSB have discovered a potentially druggable pathway that may help in treating these neurodegenerative disorders, or tauopathies. Their findings appear in Science Translational Medicine journal. ""A new pathway exists that can potentially be targeted for drug delivery that can improve the lives of patients of these neurodegenerative diseases in a relatively short amount of time. And that's particularly encouraging given the observations that the drug was very efficacious in reducing the pathology in mice [with frontotemporal dementia],""ù Israel Hernandez, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of UCSB professor and Neuroscience Research Institute co-director Kenneth Kosik, and the paper's lead author, said. The RASD2 gene encodes the signaling protein Rhes ""î part of the Ras superfamily ""î and mediates this regulatory pathway. While not much is known about this gene, it is implicated in Huntington's disease. Rhes plays a role in various signaling pathways and in the development of Huntington's. Through the process of farnesylation, a chemical compound ""î a farnesyl group ""î anchors itself to Rhes. Another closely related process called prenylation facilitates the protein's attachment to the inner layer of the cellular membrane, where it functions, Hernandez described. ""That is believed to be understood as an important mechanism by which it can actually control tau aggregates and their toxicity in cells,""ù he said. Hernandez and his colleagues realized that if they could arrest farnesylation, they might be able to prevent Rhes from being toxic to the cell. Hence, using a farnesyltransferase inhibitor ""made sense.""ù Using the drug lonafarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, the researchers could target Rhes to reduce its levels. In testing lonafarnib in mice models with frontotemporal dementia, the researchers saw significant reductions in behavioral abnormalities and neural atrophy. As the mice models age, their pathology further develops. They concurrently exhibit worsening behavioral deficits, including poor nest shredding and obsessive running around in circles by the beginning of 10 weeks. At 20 weeks, treated mice produced well-built nests and displayed less erratic behavior. They also showed less reduction in brain size and in microglia counts than their untreated counterparts. The researchers concluded that lonafarnib did not seem to reverse existing pathology but appears to act as a preventative measure. ""When we further analyzed the pathology in the brain, we observed a major reduction in the amount of tau tangles in the brains of these mice, which implies that the behavioral improvement was a consequence of the reduction of the extent of the pathology in the mice,""ù Hernandez said. Using the drug lonafarnib, UCSB researchers found a novel pathway that may potentially be druggable and may help to treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's or Alzheimer's. Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of tau protein, which forms neurofibrillary tangles. / Courtesy of National Science Foundation Originally developed with the intent to disrupt the signaling involved in cancerous cell proliferation, lonafarnib was unsuccessful in fighting cancer. However, because it has already undergone extensive clinical experience, the drug may be fast-tracked for pre-clinical human trials after repurposing it to treat tauopathies. ""Right now these neurodegenerative diseases are basically nontreatable. All the clinical approaches are done in a palliative manner. You're maybe trying to make their life better, but you're not really trying to cure them. And that's something that we think must be addressed as energetically as possible,""ù Hernandez said. Lonafarnib works through a potentially druggable pathway, meaning ""you can develop drugs that will be able to direct to Rhes in a manner that can be disease-modifying, as opposed to a target that is more difficult to modify its activity,""ù Hernandez explained. ""In this case, as an example, by using a prenyl activity inhibitor we [can] reduce the activity of Rhes and its levels. Therefore it's a target that's easy to develop drugs for.""ù While the drug's mechanism of action is still yet to be fully uncovered, Hernandez and his team found that it increased autophagy, the regulated mechanism to degrade and recycle cellular components. Lonafarnib also increased lysosomal proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins ""î notably in this case, aberrant tau ""î by lysosomal enzymes. The discovery of this biochemical pathway partaking in tau degradation helps to further uncover how such pathways interact together and are regulated by prenylation. Another impactful discovery is that there appears to be a feedback loop in regard to how Rhes recognizes tau and modifies its levels, Hernandez noted. ""The presence of the tau mutation is actually regulating the levels of Rhes present in the cell. That's very, very interesting because it suggests a regulatory loop in how Rhes reacts to the presence of mutation. Reducing these levels [of Rhes] would reduce its potential cytotoxic effects,""ù he said. Hernandez hopes to next uncover the mechanism by which prenylation regulates lysosomal proteolysis, including the processes of exocytosis and endocytosis. ""All of those are biochemical examples that are intimately related, but which prenylation was not known to be an important regulator until now. And our team discovering which are the proteins and which are the important targets in those molecular pathways will uncover further potential therapeutical targets and uncover very, very exciting biology in the tau field.""ù

science,Friends with Health Benefits,23-May-19,9:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/88467/,"In addition to the basic needs for food and sleep, humans have a basic need to form relationships and belong socially. It's no surprise that our close relationships with loved ones benefit our health and well-being, both physically and mentally. Numerous studies have shown that the effect of social support on good health and longevity appears to be on par with the effects of obesity or other lifestyle factors. One study even suggests having a network of meaningful relationships may be a stronger predictor of mortality than many lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and physical activity. However, the underlying mechanisms of how well-functioning relationships promote (or hinder) resilience to stress and thriving ""î defined here as ""coping successfully with life's adversities and actively pursuing life opportunities for growth and development""ù ""î are still not completely understood. In a 2014 paper published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Review, UC Santa Barbara psychology professor Nancy Collins takes a closer look at the effects of social support on thriving. As naturally social beings, humans are greatly affected by the social support they receive. Meaningful relationships provide physical and mental health benefits, with effects on our stress resilience and ability to thrive. According to Collins, they serve as a source of strength and as a relational catalyst even in the absence of adversity. / NEXUS FILE PHOTO The interpretation of a strong relationship may differ but in general, the given support should be ""sensitive and responsive to the recipient's goals, needs, and preferences such that the recipient feels understood, validated, and cared for.""ù Based on the attachment theory, which notes that the early emotional bonds we form affect the dynamics of future short-term and long-term interpersonal relationships, Collins proposes that close relationships with family, friends and romantic partners serve as a source of strength and as a relational catalyst.
In acting as a source of strength, relationships help us to not only cope with stress but to flourish after dealing with a stressor and to promote thriving through adversity. ""A useful metaphor is that houses destroyed by storms are frequently rebuilt, not into the same houses that existed before, but into homes that are better able to withstand similar storms in the future,""ù the study states. ""So too are people able to emerge from adverse life circumstances stronger and better off than they were before with the support of significant others who fortify and assist them in the rebuilding. In this sense, relationships can provide a source of strength, in addition to a refuge, in adverse circumstances.""ù When facing adversities, we turn to our supportive relationships as a ""safe haven""ù ""î a comfortable environment allowing for emotional or physical relief through the expression of empathy, reassurance and acceptance. Such relationships also provide fortification to nurture strengths and talents, and assist in emotional reconstruction through providing motivation and encouraging perseverance. Finally, they help to redefine the adversity as a mechanism for positive change. Collins's paper highlights that even in the absence of adversity, our social bonds serve as relational catalysts to support our ability to thrive. Meaningful relationships ""nurture a desire to create and/or seize life opportunities for growth,""ù and in doing so, promote development and exploration. This comes through the shared development of plans, strategies and skills for approaching opportunities and through being encouraging and non-intrusive, yet available, during life exploration. It's when loved ones celebrate our accomplishments and successes, respond sensitively to setbacks and help make adjustments along the way. According to the paper, ""supportive relationships can help people thrive by promoting engagement in opportunities that enable them to enhance their positive well-being by broadening and building resources and finding purpose and meaning in life.""ù Receiving support yields immediate benefits, Collins reports. In one experiment in which participants faced a stressful speech task, their levels of cortisol (commonly known as the stress hormone) were lower when they received emotional support from their romantic partners. ""Recent experimental research also shows that the actual or symbolic presence of attachment figures can attenuate neural activation in brain regions associated with threat and emotion regulation and reduce perceptions of pain,""ù the study states. In fact, neuroscience reveals that our brains are inherently social. Matthew Lieberman, a psychology professor at UC Los Angeles, found that the default mode of the brain (i.e. the resting brain function when we aren't performing an active task) appears practically identical to the brain during social cognition in ""making sense of other people and ourselves.""ù In his 2013 book Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect, Lieberman asserts that this predisposition toward the default network ""may nudge our attention toward the social world ""¶ to think about other people's minds ""î their thoughts, feelings, and goals.""ù ""It suggests that evolution, figuratively speaking, made a big bet on the importance of developing and using our social intelligence for the overall success of our species by focusing the brain's free time on it,""ù he continues. Here in Isla Vista and the UCSB community, opportunities to forge these strong social connections are abundant. If you feel like you may lack these sorts of connections, just know that ""we Gaucho back.""ù

Especially noteworthy in the study were the creative methods used to study these enormous fish, capable of growing up to nearly five feet. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Palmyra Atoll is a small island in the Equatorial Pacific, almost due south of Hawaii. As undisturbed by humans as a place can be, it features white sand beaches, coconut palms, four o'clock flowers and, off the coast, coral reefs teeming with life. Here, researchers follow the path of the bumphead parrotfish, or ""Bolbo,""ù as they're affectionately called. They snorkel behind these enormous ""underwater elephants""ù who, through their consumption of coral skeletons, shape the shallow seas that they call home. ""Palmyra is this really pristine coral reef atoll ""î for the most part ""î that's a thousand miles south of Hawaii. It's a speck in the Pacific, and it provides this great system for researchers to come back to with all sorts of different questions about how coral reefs and Pacific coral reefs in particular function. People study everything there,""ù Grace Goldberg, a marine scientist with UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute (MSI) said. Goldberg first began work with data from Palmyra while she was an undergraduate at Stanford University. ""I was at Stanford as a student, and Professor [Douglas] McCauley, who's on the paper, was a Ph.D. student at Stanford. We both ended up going to the Marine Science Institute,""ù Goldberg†said. At MSI, they began to focus on the bizarre eating habits of the bumphead parrotfish (bolbometopon muricatum), the largest species of parrotfish. Their diet, unusual compared to that of other primarily herbivorous parrotfish, consists of structural reef carbonates and the lifeforms that corals harbor. ""[When they're eating] they're redistributing the sand, so they're taking chunks of coral. Behind that beak they have is actually like a rock crusher, and they poop out this white sand,""ù Goldberg said. Their sheer size makes them integral bioeroders. These parrotfish cycle the matter of the reef and keep it moving throughout the system. ""They're absolutely enormous and for that reason ecologically relevant in a different way than little parrotfish,""ù Goldberg said. ""They have this role in shaping the structure of the reef ""î that's why they're called bioeroders. The coral reef is this rock structure, and the fish are facilitating breaking that down into sand.""ù Goldberg and her colleagues wanted to study how this redistribution of raw materials affected the living system. ""We wanted to understand how maybe the sand, having all that calcium carbonate in the water, has some ramifications for how ocean acidification is going to affect reefs where they live. Yes, they're moving calcium carbonate around, but they're also moving nutrients around. We wondered whether or not they had a fertilizing effect,""ù Goldberg said. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons In order to gather field data, researchers in Palmyra would follow a parrotfish and mimic them when they fed on coral skeletons. ""A colleague spent days picking a fish and snorkeling along behind them, and the fish would take a bite, and they would go with a chisel and take a ""òfake bite' next to that bite. We would have a ""òfake bite' ""î of what they would've eaten, basically ""î and we'd take that back to the lab.""ù Once at the lab, Goldberg and her colleagues used calorimetry in order to gauge the available energy of each ""bite.""ù Each one was slightly different. The ratio of living-to-dead matter, as well as the manner of microorganisms that inhabited coral skeletons, had a significant influence on the quantity of energy to be found in each one. ""They're eating a lot of live coral, and live coral is like eating something that is the opposite of an orange ""î there's like a thin peel of meat around a big piece of chalk. There's only a little bit of nutritious good stuff. They're eating a lot of just, like, skeleton material,""ù Goldberg said. ""But then there are also areas where the coral animal has died, the skeleton is there and all sorts of things have grown over it and gone into the skeleton to live in it. When they're eating that stuff ""î the dead coral substrate ""î they're getting three times as many calories out of every bite.""ù However, more notable than the findings itself were the technical methods with which the researchers gathered and compiled data upon returning to the lab, according to Goldberg. Goldberg employed calorimeters that had been more commonly used to gauge the fuel obtained from burning coal in order to get a clearer picture of the sum total of everything that they were consuming through their grazing. ""The parrotfish are not just eating the food on the plate, they're eating the plate also, and then pooping out white sand ""î a ground-up plate. In other research they've washed the food off of the plate, would be the analogy, and then measured those calories,""ù Goldberg said. She is excited to see how researchers adopt this perspective and MSI's methods in later studies. ""One thing that this paper contributes is that it shows ""î it kind of creates ""î this example of how ecologists can use these tools in materials science and new techniques in ocean chemistry to ask these types of ecological questions.

science,Marine Species More Vulnerable to Global Warming Than Terrestrial Species,30-May-19,9:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/marine-species-more-vulnerable-to-global-warming-than-terrestrial-species/,"A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that marine species may be more susceptible to global warming effects ""î specifically increases in temperatures ""î than land creatures. The international group of researchers, including Douglas McCauley from UC Santa Barbara, was interested in figuring out which parts of life on the planet would be most challenged by climate change. They performed a two-way comparison of species on land and species in the ocean to look at their vulnerability to warming temperatures. Specifically, they compared the sensitivity of ectotherms, or cold-blooded organisms, in the two major realms. ""All organisms, whether you're warm-blooded or cold-blooded, have this range of temperatures that you can tolerate before your body starts to shut down and experience serious physiological stress ""î a lower bound and an upper bound. And so with warming, we're mostly concerned about the upper bound because these temperatures are getting hotter and hotter,""ù McCauley, an associate professor in UCSB's Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology and its Marine Science Institute, said. The main takeaway of the study is that ectotherms in the ocean are more likely to be vulnerable to thermal stress, he stated. The scientists compiled the upper thermal limits for 406 total ectothermic species ""î 88 marine and 318 terrestrial ""î and assessed their position relative to the temperature threshold before they would begin to experience heat shock or heat stroke. ""It turned out that in the ocean, marine animals were sitting much closer to that maximum, much closer to this ceiling where they would overheat and get into a real physiological stressful situation than terrestrial animals were, on average ""î which means that there is then less buffering for them to get to these overheating points in the ocean,""ù McCauley said. In addition, McCauley and his colleagues found that local species extinctions in the ocean occurred at twice the rate than those on land. ""We think that much of those local species extinctions in the ocean is being driven by marine animals that are right up against that ceiling or have crossed that ceiling, so either local species have gone extinct or have to, like a climate refugee, get out of there and go somewhere else,""ù he said. Generally, land species are advantaged to cope with global warming because of microhabitat thermal refuges found within the natural variability on land, such as a burrow or shade under a tree, in which they can hide and cool off. In the ocean, ectotherms may face greater stress because of the fewer thermal refuges available there than on land. If a thermometer were placed in 12 different locations outside with different exposures to light and shade, it would record a range of different ambient air temperatures, McCauley said, whereas almost no variation in temperature would be found underwater if a thermometer were placed in 12 different locations in the ocean. ""It's like one big water bath. Just like in a swimming pool or in a bath, it's pretty much the same temperature once the water gets mixed everywhere that you experience throughout,""ù McCauley said. ""If you hide under a hole in the ocean, water is pretty much the same temperature that it is outside because the temperature that you experience in the environment is controlled by the water temperature.""ù Terrestrial animals, such as these elephants, are advantaged with more thermal refuges on land, including the shade from a tree. Fewer thermal refuges underwater may be one reason why marine species are more vulnerable to warming temperatures than terrestrial ones. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Marine organisms may also have heightened vulnerability and sensitivity to thermal stress because they experience less thermal variability on average than do land creatures. During the transition from winter to summer or even across the duration of a day, a temperature logger tracks noticeably greater changes on land than in water. ""It's possible, and I think there is promise for causality here, in that all that variation you see on land challenges organisms that live on land to expand this [thermal] window because they experience that range and those fluctuations in temperature across a day, across a year,""ù McCauley said. ""Day to day, year to year, they have to figure out a way to physiologically deal with all that variability in temperature.""ù Marine species haven't needed to worry about temperature fluctuations as much, leaving them more disadvantaged to deal with the rapidly rising ocean temperatures. ""In the ocean, because there's less of that flux, we challenge them to come up with physiological solutions when historically there hasn't been a lot of changes in temperature. The oceans have been more static. That could give them less practice, if you will, with how to deal with temperature extremes in hotter directions, so they don't know how to cope with it because they have no history with it.""ù McCauley notes his team's findings do not necessarily indicate that terrestrial animals are much better off than marine ones. ""We're not saying that all attention should be paid to the oceans right now and we're not saying that life on land is going to be okay. We saw a whole lot of stress for life on land and life in the oceans, but we see this elevated stress and these accelerated local species extinctions in the oceans,""ù he said. As for how to aid these vulnerable marine species, McCauley urges taking measures to help grow their populations, such as limiting fishing activity or creating protected areas. Larger populations have more genetic variability, which increases the probability of biologically inventing a solution for global warming. ""Climate change management is a bit like a triage exercise: The first thing you want to do ""î and the first thing that should be taken away from this ""î is that if there is so much more vulnerability in places as important as the ocean, we probably need to redouble our efforts to figure out how to take this vulnerability away, how to deal with global warming.""ù While acknowledging that these are big challenges, McCauley says that having this understanding that these species are living precariously close to the upper bounds of their thermal thresholds, especially if they are profitable seafood species important for food, may ""inspire global leaders that are already thinking of meeting these commitments to the Paris Agreement [which aims to have the global temperature rise for this century remain below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial era levels] and ""¶ give them more incentive and more motivation to stick with those commitments.""ù Beyond looking to mitigate the effects of global warming, the study's results could help marine scientists like McCauley in trying to find solutions to relieve some of the stress marine animals face. Species like salmon or tuna encounter many stressors that are more immediate, including overfishing or a lack of protected areas or plastic pollution, in addition to the ongoing thermal stressor. ""In some ways we can think of these cases ""î like a cod ""î like individuals that are admitted to a hospital where you have some chronic stress like cancer that is going to kill them, but then there are a lot of things like flu that is really making them sick here and now. If you can deal with some of the things that are making them sick in the here and now, maybe that gives them more energy and more capability to be resilient to deal with this longer-term stress,""ù McCauley said. ""Knowing that the ocean life is more vulnerable helps us take away from the stressors that we can actually manage tomorrow or today, but [it also helps us] not forget we have to deal with the cancer, we have to deal with the global warming. That's really important to do that, and to do that quickly because of this hypervulnerability that we see.""ù McCauley is next focusing on the finding about local species extinctions being twice as high in the ocean and to better quantify what loss of these species means to humans. ""It's sort of obvious that if you lose a species in the ocean, you lose biodiversity and there may be other consequences, but it's not as intuitively as clear what that means for the economics and health of people that depend on these species,""ù he said. With his collaborators, McCauley is working to understand the implications of loss of species for populations who depend on those species, particularly in terms of food and nutrition. ""We're trying to understand how important are those species to human nutrition so that when we see a species go missing in the ocean, we know exactly what that means for human health, which maybe gets people more motivated to care about some of those numbers and for us to know what those numbers of local species extinction loss would mean.""ù

science,African Social Spiders Demonstrate How Group Dynamics Influence Success of Individual Colonies,30-May-19,1:15 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/african-social-spiders-demonstrate-how-group-dynamics-influence-success-of-individual-colonies/,"Pruitt's study looked at the performance of African social spider societies depending on their levels of aggressiveness or docility. / Courtesy of Jonathan Pruitt In Southern Africa, as one walks through sparse woodland, they may come across white sheets ""î reminiscent of translucent tablecloths ""î set atop brambles or foliage and left to dangle. Spiders here have evolved to bunch together in colonies, building these intricate webs which they use to ensnare unsuspecting prey together as a collective. Jonathan Pruitt, a UCSB associate professor with the Department of Evolution, Ecology, and Marine Biology, has spent the better part of eight years studying African social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) in Namibia and the Drakensberg, and his latest work with them has shed light on the various ways in which the success of a colony can be affected by its behavioral tendencies. ""Most recently I did research regarding what traits enable the success of societies and whether or not that the optimal strategy of a society might change based on what the other societies around you are doing,""ù Pruitt said. African social spiders are the perfect test subjects because the researchers could establish experimental colonies in a site which would then reliably stick to the location where it was placed. ""What social spiders do in the wild is they basically create a multifemale colony that they use to intercept prey, like a shared trap together in their web. They basically are filter feeders and they wait for prey to come by,""ù Pruitt said. ""Social spiders are a special case where basically, all these little spiders are trapped on a ship ""î their colony ""î and if the ship goes down, they're screwed.""ù Pruitt and his team created experimental groups of colonies which they compared with one another. On a given tree in the field, they would place together five colonies composed of 10 spiders, each of which had different temperaments and levels of aggression. ""In some of those patches I had colonies that were all aggressive, all docile, and then I had varying ratios of docile to aggressive groups. I monitored their performance. How much food did they get? How many offspring did they produce? Et cetera, et cetera, for the next five months in the wild,""ù Pruitt said. The researchers defined aggressive and docile behavior according to levels of activity which individuals exhibited within a colony and then the activity of the colony as a whole. ""Aggressive societies produce massive filters to skim prey out of the sky, and they're very responsive to prey when it hits the web. Docile societies produce relatively small filters and aren't as responsive to prey, such that when prey hits the web only one or two spiders will come out, versus an aggressive society, where when prey intercepts the web maybe 20 individuals will come out,""ù Pruitt said. The presence of two dispositions begs the question, which one leads to greater success? According to Pruitt's findings, the answer depends. ""I created a generalized linear model to answer how does the performance of a society change depending on whether it's aggressive or docile, and does that relationship change based on who's around it, so [that includes] the frequency of an aggressive colony strategy in that neighborhood,""ù Pruitt said. The study, published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, found that the success of a given community was contingent on the behavioral tendencies of the surrounding communities, coupled with the availability of resources. More abundant resources in the environment made for more successful aggressive colonies. ""If there are lots of resources that can be exploited, then it's advantageous to be an aggressive society; you're able to capture more food, you're able to exploit lots of resources and you're able to produce lots of offspring,""ù Pruitt said. However, the density of aggressive societies in a given experimental group would affect the success of a group of colonies as a whole. Aggressive colonies performed best when they didn't have to cohabit with other aggressive colonies. ""When aggressive societies become more abundant, they end up depleting those resources ""¶ Under those circumstances aggressive societies can't exploit resources and are burning all this energy basically waiting for resources which are never going to arrive.""ù During these periods of scarcity, docile societies would end up winning out over ones who put in more effort to find resources ""î resources which no longer were present in the volumes which are necessary to support colonies with a high energy expenditure. ""At that point, it tends to be docile societies which can live off of less. So docile societies might not be so good at exploiting resources when they're around, but they're able to live off of basically nothing,""ù Pruitt said. Pruitt now works at McMaster University in Canada but maintains a soft appointment at UCSB. Students working in his lab at McMaster are conducting research with other animals, including wasps, acorn ants and ""î tentatively ""î damselfish. ""It's still ongoing, and we're looking to see whether or not this is an anomaly of one particular study. We want to see if the findings are robust, but in principle, it stands to reason that what your society should do, in terms of optimal strategy, will depend on what your rivals and neighbors are doing, with virtually any species,""ù Pruitt said.

science,Isla Vista Compost Collective Plans to Double Composting Service for Fall 2019,6-Jun-19,9:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/isla-vista-compost-collective-plans-to-double-composting-service-for-fall-2019/,"† IVCC, which began its program in Fall 2017, will expand its weekly service to 96 houses in Isla Vista for Fall Quarter 2019. / Courtesy of Siena Hooper Around 30% of landfills consist of food scraps and yard waste, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. If these organic wastes were instead composted or disposed of in soil, soil quality could increase and provide nutrients for plants. By not occupying space in landfills and decomposing, compostable organic materials can also significantly reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Dedicated to enabling Isla Vista residents to learn and execute this eco-friendly practice, the Ocean Friendly Gardens Committee of Isla Vista Surfrider founded the Isla Vista Compost Collective during Fall Quarter 2017. ""The Surfrider Foundation is a nationwide foundation that works on protecting our nation's beaches through advocacy with the government, beach cleanups and other programs such as monitoring the water quality of our oceans or maintaining healthy soil in our gardens, which is what our compost program does,""ù Siena Hooper, co-director of the Isla Vista Compost Collective (IVCC), said. The composting initiative began with an idea by Jacob Bider, the other co-director of IVCC, almost two years ago. ""I returned to UCSB after my first year eager to make a positive impact on the community of Isla Vista. As I moved out of the dorms and into a house on DP, I began to notice the excessive amount of waste produced by I.V. residents,""ù Bider said. ""While there were existing efforts being made to handle the recycling and disposal of solid waste from residences, there were no efforts being made to properly dispose of organic or food waste,""ù he continued. ""I saw this not only as a problem that needed to be fixed, but also as an opportunity to provide residents with the ability to properly dispose, or compost, food waste from home. After joining the Ocean Friendly Gardens Committee of Isla Vista Surfrider in Fall 2017, I proposed that we create a compost program for Isla Vista, and we did just that.""ù IVCC first tested its composting service during Fall 2017, serving under 10 I.V. houses. Currently, IVCC services 51 houses in I.V. It composts an average of 600 pounds of organic waste weekly, with over 10,000 pounds of compost produced since the program's formation. ""If we are able to expand to 96 houses in the fall, then we'll be composting, on average, over 1,000 pounds per week. By the end of the 2019-2020 school year, we will have composted over 30,000 pounds,""ù Bider said. Each week, ""Dirtriders""ù on bikes with a cargo trailer attached pick up buckets filled with food product from their designated houses. Then, they drop off a new, clean five-gallon bucket for their houses to compost in for another week. Dirtriders maintain weekly communication with each house, informing the residents how many pounds of compost they've generated each week and helping them improve and learn if they've composted incorrectly. ""In the beginning of the quarter, we provide every house with laminated guidelines which explain what can and can't be composted, such as no meat, dairy, or stickers on fruits and vegetables. When our Dirtriders sort through the compost and find something that wasn't supposed to be composted, they will text that house and remind them to not put certain things in their compost in order to educate them on how to properly compost,""ù Hooper stated. Courtesy of Siena Hooper The Dirtriders then transport the food product to St. Michael's University Church and the University United Methodist Church in Isla Vista to be added to their compost piles and community gardens. Working with Isla Vista Recreation & Park District and the Resource Recovery and Waste Management Division of Santa Barbara, IVCC gives a portion of the collected food product to MarBorg Industries, a waste management service. This food product is converted to a nutrient dense soil amendment for use in Santa Barbara County orchards, minimizing the need for chemical fertilizers. ""One benefit of donating food product to the St. Michaels and Methodist Church compost piles is that there are no greenhouse gas emissions associated with its transportation, since we use a bike and cargo trailer. A typical waste management service would transport food product by truck, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions,""ù Bider said.  ""Another benefit of donating to these churches is that food product of Isla Vista residents is created into compost that is ultimately used on community gardens in Isla Vista, contributing to a circular economy,""ù he added. IVCC aims to service at least 25 houses over the summer before expanding its service to 96 houses in the 2019 fall quarter. IVCC's goal is to ""expand [the program] as much as we can,""ù Hooper said. ""Once we get a stable source of funding, we'll probably try to invest in an electric golf cart so we can serve more houses during one shift. The bike isn't the most efficient because we can only fit four buckets at one time ""¶ We just want to be able to serve as many people in our community as we can.""ù To encourage participating houses to compost, IVCC holds a weekly competition in which it tracks how much compost is produced per person in each household. ""We'll track the house that composted the most weight per person and we'll highlight them every week. Since we began this competition we have seen an influx of food product being composted by houses,""ù Bider said. The winner is featured on IVCC's Instagram, @ivcompostcollective. ""We have everyone in the winning house take a picture with their compost bucket, which is posted on our Instagram. Our houses have gotten really excited and competitive about it, which gives them an extra incentive to compost more each week,""ù Hooper said. For those who may not be able to sign up with IVCC but are interested in composting, food products can be brought to the compost piles at St. Michael's University Church and the United Methodist Church, which are open to the community. Compostable items can also be dropped off at Pardall Center's compostable receptacle.  Isla Vista residents interested in composting with IVCC or becoming a Dirtrider in the summer or Fall Quarter 2019 can sign up at islavistacompost.com.

science,Bren Professor Researches Logistics of Carbon Capture and Utilization,6-Jun-19,1:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-06/bren-professor-researches-logistics-of-carbon-capture-and-utilization/,"An illustration depicting implementing CCU technologies and subsequent changes in the life cycles of established chemicals. / Courtesy of PNAS Researchers with UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, in collaboration with RWTH Aachen (Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule Aache) University in Germany, have performed complex data analysis and modeling, aiming to understand the logistical feasibility of carbon capture and utilization. Carbon capture and utilization, or CCU, is a process in which atmospheric carbon is captured and recycled into various materials. This is in contrast to carbon capture and storage, where atmospheric carbon is instead deposited in a location where it cannot enter the atmosphere. ""The concept of Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS, is widely known, but if you do that you are not really utilizing it. Instead if you turn [carbon] into plastic then you can create value out of it,""ù Sangwon Suh, a Bren professor of industrial ecology and a co-author of the paper, said in an interview with the Nexus. Plastics have become ubiquitous in the relatively short time since beginning production on a large scale. This coincides with rapid global industrialization, which has resulted in dramatic increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Suh and his colleagues began to wonder how carbon emissions could be harnessed and stored in plastic and other chemical materials. ""The question is whether we can turn this large volume of carbonaceous material that we are producing into an opportunity to store the carbon that is emitted into the atmosphere that creates the greenhouse gas effect.""ù To investigate this, those same researchers collected process-level data from the chemical industry. ""It's all about modeling. We're using data that covers about 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions covered by the entire chemical industry. There's a very detailed engineering model that covers the global chemical industry, so we analyzed greenhouse gas emission and energy requirements by these industries,""ù Suh said. The researchers then began to study the processes which could be employed when turning carbon dioxide into potential substitutes for petrochemicals, which are currently used in the manufacturing of plastics. Unfortunately, according to their study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, CCU may not be as viable as originally thought. In order for carbon dioxide to act as a feedstock for CCU, hydrogen needs to be produced as an additive. ""Petrochemicals normally contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. With carbon dioxide, you have carbon and oxygen, but there's no hydrogen, so we have to bring hydrogen from somewhere else,""ù Suh explained. ""Currently the largest source of hydrogen that we are using at the industrial scale is coming from natural gas. If we use natural gas to source hydrogen, we are actually creating more greenhouse gas emissions than if we produced plastic with petrochemicals.""ù Electrolysis of water can be used as a source of hydrogen; however, this requires energy and, if this energy were sourced from fossil fuels, it would be counterproductive and result in more emissions than we are able to utilize.  ""That leads us to an interesting question. Yes, there is a very significant potential for CCU to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ""î but in order to do that you need a huge amount of renewable energy, largely for the electrolysis,""ù Suh stated. ""We would need more [renewable energy] than what was projected to be produced by 2030, which was largely considered a very ambitious target already.""ù In order for CCU to be viable, Suh believes that the adoption of CCU must coincide with a widespread transition to the use of renewable energy sources to accommodate the energy demands of electrolysis. ""The magnitude of renewable energy generation needed is huge ""î beyond what countries and international organizations are expecting to generate. And, going further we will need to develop means to regulate this: For example, large-scale battery storage technology.""ù  There are more complications involved with generating and transporting hydrogen than with the energy used in electrolysis. ""We need large-scale hydrogen production that is close enough to renewable sources to be able to use renewable electricity. Say the Mojave Desert produces a lot of renewable energy. If there [are] no means for us to transmit that electricity to a facility in, say, Santa Barbara, then we cannot use it,"" Suh detailed.  Transporting hydrogen to facilities that produce plastics and other chemicals is another issue exacerbated by the physical properties of hydrogen and the lack of infrastructure currently dedicated to the transport of hydrogen on an industrial scale.  ""Hydrogen is such a low-density material; it's the second lowest density material that we know of. So unless we have a pipeline infrastructure that is established, moving around hydrogen will be a huge challenge.""ù Going beyond the issues of CCU and hydrogen generation, CCU doesn't solve other issues related to plastic pollution, such as the accumulation of microplastics and single-use litter in the environment. ""The properties of those plastics will be identical to the plastics that we are generating today. There is no difference in terms of how they behave in the environment,""ù Suh said.  Suh believes that before CCU can be considered as a solution, scientists and producers must ask themselves two questions:  ""First, [is it] even possible? Second, if it is, is it really the best use of renewable energy to dissociate hydrogen from water electrolysis to create plastics? I think ultimately it'll take transitioning to a low-carbon infrastructure, and we need that at a massive scale,""ù Suh said.  ""I think that's what our paper is telling us. CCU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provided that we have a massive scale of renewable energy available. Unless we achieve that, CCU will never work.""ù

science,Where in the World is Marine Biodiversity Risk More Prevalent?,27-Jun-19,10:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-27/where-in-the-world-is-marine-biodiversity-risk-more-prevalent/,"In assessing the health of Earth's oceans, researchers at UC Santa Barbara and Virginia's Old Dominion University set out to map the global distribution of where marine species are most at risk for extinction. The study, published in the journal Conservation Letters, also considers how this risk may be affected in marine protected areas (MPAs) compared to in non-protected areas. ""If we compare conservation status to the species range of thousands of different species at the same time, we can get a sense of where in the oceans are the ecosystems, the biodiversity, most at risk for extinction from threats that people put on the species,""ù Casey O'Hara, a doctoral student in UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and lead author of the paper, said. After compiling the range and conservation status of 5,291 marine species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, O'Hara and colleagues, including his advisor, professor Ben Halpern, calculated the average extinction risk for each species against their worldwide distribution. Species on the Red List are categorized into nine groups which fall under three broader groups: ""extinct,""ù ""threatened""ù and ""lower risk.""ù ""Threatened""ù species can further be classified as ""critically endangered,""ù ""endangered""ù or ""vulnerable""ù, and ""lower risk""ù incorporates species which are ""near threatened,""ù ""conservation dependent""ù or of ""least concern.""ù The researchers found that global marine biodiversity risk averaged just under ""near threatened,""ù with nearly 0.1% of species considered to be of ""least concern.""ù For 83% of the ocean, at least 25% of species are deemed ""threatened.""ù Additionally, the study revealed that high seas biodiversity faced a disproportionately higher risk of extinction than in national waters. The Mediterranean and Black Seas faced the greatest biodiversity risk. Interestingly, although ecosystems by the coast and continental shelves experienced more cumulative human impact, they largely presented less biodiversity risk than did open oceanic habitats.

Sidebars present the span of conservation status and proportion of threatened species. / Courtesy of Conservation Letters When examining biodiversity risk in MPAs versus in non-protected areas, O'Hara noted that variations in risk were nearly indistinguishable. But different regions showed considerable variation in how they set up marine reserve protection. ""There are two different philosophies of protection that you can consider: One would be proactive protection, which would be ""¶ maintaining [an already] healthy, pristine area for future generations [and to] allow that place to remain relatively untouched by human threats,""ù O'Hara explained. The other strategy is reactive protection, which ""[reacts] to the threats that are already existing""ù in a heavily impacted place. The main goal to alleviate stressors and allow it to ""recover back to healthy states.""ù In contrast to European, African and Central American reserves which focus more on less-impacted places ""î following proactive protection ""î MPAs in places such as Asia and North and South America favor protecting higher-risk areas, exhibiting reactive protection.†† According to O'Hara, achieving a balance of both protection approaches would provide the ideal ""representative protection.""ù One concern the scientists had, particularly for protection in less-impacted areas, was the presence of ""paper parks.""ù These regions appear protected on paper but may lack biodiversity risk in the first place. Their research does not identify paper parks but offers a clearer profile of where signals to find paper parks may exist.† ""Those areas could also be less impacted just because they're far away; they don't have a lot of resources that people are actively using. So you run the risk of protecting an area that is not actually really at risk,""ù O'Hara said.†† Inversely, he added, for places emphasizing reactive protection such as North America, the data could provide valuable insight into where to potentially implement proactive protection while incurring a lower political and economic cost. Such considerations may come in handy as the global biodiversity protection and conservation targets set by the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity in 2010 will undergo renegotiations in 2020. ""With these results, this can help inform that renegotiation process by highlighting some areas where a greater proportion of threatened species [are], to help focus attention on conserving those areas,""ù O'Hara said.  ""It takes a lot of people doing a lot of research [including at UCSB] and a lot of effort to be able to protect our oceans for the future. We're not where we need to be, but hopefully we'll be there soon.""ù†

science,Monitoring by NGOs Helps Increase Compliance with National Mandates,5-Jul-19,10:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-05/monitoring-by-ngos-helps-increase-compliance-with-national-mandates/,"In democratic countries such as the United States, the public's voice, when augmented by the media and nongovernmental organizations, can more effectively hold local governments accountable in monitoring their compliance with national mandates. In other places such as authoritarian China, enforcing municipal compliance with centralized mandates is made more difficult by, among other things, heavy censorship and the fact that taking collective action to openly challenge governmental policies and actions is illegal. To understand how non-state actors, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), can still act in a place like China, UC Santa Barbara's Sarah Anderson and Mark Buntaine partnered with researchers from China's Nanjing University for an ambitious national-level study. Their results have been published in the American Journal of Political Science. ""If you're the central government, and you need activities to take place at the municipal level, it is just really, really hard to observe whether that given city is taking that action. So they face a big information gap. They can ask for reports, but it's pretty hard to know even the quality of that information. And so, that's where we think these NGOs have this capacity to provide that information,""ù Anderson, an associate professor of environmental politics at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, said. To address air pollution, China's central government issued mandates to local governments.†The Chinese NGO, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), annually rates municipal governments on their compliance with these national mandates. In this case, since the central government's goals align with those of the IPE, the government ""welcomes social organizations to actively participate in the promotion of environmental information disclosure,""ù according to the paper. The investigators saw it as a prime opportunity to perform an ""interesting""ù study, ""which was a huge undertaking,""ù Anderson said. ""What we did was think, ""òI wonder if that has any effect; I wonder if this is a way that an NGO that wants sort of the same thing as the government wants ""î a reduction of pollution and increase in [local government] transparency ""î can act in ways that help the central government to achieve that.'""ù A thick layer of smog, a type of air pollution, in Beijing, China / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The research team partnered with the IPE to monitor air pollution at local levels. The process included figuring out how much pollution was emitted as well as what actions the localities were taking to try to mitigate air pollution. After selecting 50 cities, Anderson and colleagues told half of them that they would rate their compliance with the transparency mandates. Additionally, they would reveal that rating to the city, the public and the central government. The other 25 municipalities were still rated but were not aware of being monitored and did not have their scores disclosed to them nor to the public. ""The control cities didn't really know that we were watching them, and the treatment cities were being watched and they knew they were being watched,""ù Anderson explained. Over the course of three years, the research team tracked the changes in government practices for the 50 municipalities. All cities improved in compliance after receiving pressure from the central government. However, the localities that were rated and knew their ratings would be publicly revealed doubled their score improvement compared to the localities whose ratings were not divulged.† ""We think this is a really great way of being able to say there's a causal relationship between rating and revealing and changing behavior on the part of cities, across these cities,""ù Anderson remarked. One reason for this effect is top-down pressure, according to Anderson. ""The cities that have their ratings revealed also get additional pressure from our equivalent to a county-level government. There are other ways that that pressure can come to bear, especially in a place like China where there are a lot of incentives for officials and cities to meet compliance targets ""¶ They're used to a system where when they're told they have to do this, if they know that the upper-level government will know that they did it, there will be consequences.""ù In checking China's equivalent to Twitter, called Weibo, the investigators found no evidence of bottom-up pressure. They did not observe that public discourse from residents in the monitored cities that would have their ratings revealed was influencing the cities' compliance. ""That might be a limitation of this approach for an NGO in a place like China,""ù Anderson said. ""They've had to be very careful to make sure that they are not mobilizing the public because you can imagine that ""¶ [it] is not a particularly good strategy.""ù One significant takeaway from the research is that NGOs can still play an integral role even in an authoritarian country like China. ""We wouldn't be surprised maybe if we found this in the U.S., but I think it's surprising in China,""ù Anderson noted. ""It opens up our thinking about what roles these non-state actors can play in that kind of system in ways that we didn't really understand before.""ù Secondly, the study ""shows the efficacy [of ranking schemes] in a causal way and on a really big scale, which is something we may not have known before.""ù Anderson hopes to further explore and understand the role of transparency and how it can be utilized as a tool to help solve environmental and other problems. ""That has in the past been a really hard problem, because you're all for transparency when you're doing well, and you're all not for transparency when you're not doing well. So you can imagine you often observe a relationship between transparency and good outcomes,""ù Anderson said. ""We're hoping this opens up the research agenda into actually unpacking whether transparency [is] improving outcomes, like reducing pollution.""ù

science,UCSB Researchers Uncover Conditions Leading to Unusual 2015 Algal Bloom,11-Jul-19,1:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-11/ucsb-researchers-uncover-conditions-leading-to-unusual-2015-algal-bloom/,"The coccolithophore bloom in the Santa Barbara Channel in June 2015. / Courtesy of Paul Matson A combination of conditions during May and June of 2015 made the Santa Barbara Channel shimmer with a turquoise hue that was more reminiscent of a tropical paradise or a glacial lake than a strip of California coast. Now, a team of researchers working with Dr. Debora Iglesias-Rodriguez of UCSB's Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB) Department has found the answer as to why: an unprecedented coccolithophore bloom in the Santa Barbara Channel. ""We're both very interested in coccolithophores, and one day, there were reports of the water looking a strange turquoise color,""ù Paul Matson, a postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, said in an interview with the Nexus.† ""It's weird; it looked very similar to coccolithophore blooms which Dr. Iglesias-Rodriguez studied before in the North Atlantic.""ù Coccolithophores are a type of small phytoplankton, or microscopic algae, covered in chalky plates of calcium carbonate. Although they are usually present in the waters off of California, it is rare for them to be found in the abundances that Matson and his peers observed. Coccolithophores turn water turquoise during bloom events because the chalk from their plates reflects a particular wavelength of sunlight. This coloration in other turquoise regions can be attributed, yes, to coccolithophores, but also to the depth of water as well as dispersed or settled sediment such as rock flour. ""We were really excited to see this happening. This happened to occur when we were observing abnormal environmental conditions,""ù Matson said. ""There was an event called the ""òWarm Blob' in 2014 where we saw massive warming in the northeastern Pacific, and following that was the 2014 El Ni√±o event which happened along the coast.""ù The coccolithophores studied in the Santa Barbara Channel, namely Emiliania huxleyi, or E. hux for short, need particular conditions in order to grow prolifically. ""It needs to have stratified water, which you tend to find in the summertime here. Stratified water is not really well-mixed. You have these different layers of water masses; coccolithophores tend to bloom up in the surface when you have stratification,""ù Matson explained. ""It also helps not to have a lot of nutrients in the water. Coccolithophores are really good at growing when there's not a lot of nutrients available.""ù These appropriate climatic conditions set into motion a chain of events which precipitated the abnormal coccolithophore bloom.††† ""We had these warm water conditions. Along the coast of California, there's a nice correlation between lower temperatures and the amount of nutrients you have, because the nutrients are coming up from deep water through upwelling,""ù Matson said.† These low-nutrient conditions coincided with diatom blooms. The rapid population growth of diatoms, or single-celled algae, used up much of the nutrients which were present in the water initially and left very little remaining once their bloom concluded. Coccolithophores do not need as many nutrients to thrive; an environment with a dearth of nutrients actually benefits them because these conditions snuff out would-be competitors, giving them much more room within their ecological niche to grow. ""They were able to expand their population without having to compete with the diatoms. It was the perfect environment for a coccolithophore bloom to happen,""ù Matson said.† An image of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi taken using scanning electron microscopy. / Courtesy of Paul Matson The researchers employed scanning electron microscopy to confirm the presence of coccolithophores and collaborated with other scientists to document the spatial distribution of the bloom and its movement in accordance with current.† ""We used information about surface currents ""î how water was moving and how fast it was going ""î and we were able to do simulations regarding how the water parcels the particles and moves them around, hour by hour and from one day to the next day, to see how the bloom was being pushed around off the coast,""ù Matson described. It was especially fortuitous that the bloom occurred in the Santa Barbara Channel, a strip of coast which has been subject to close monitoring.† ""If this had occurred further up or down the coast where we didn't have this data, we wouldn't know what the background conditions were like, and we couldn't generate a data set with regards to how blooms form and move around.""ù† ""We're able to piggyback on that information. The bloom happened to occur in a region we have been actively studying for years,""ù Matson said. ""One of the really cool things about this is that we've had people doing long-term monitoring in this area for a long time, and this allows us to form a baseline of conditions. When we have a really rare event, it gives us a starting point to understand what is happening differently now,""ù Matson said.

science,Forming and Fueling Galaxies,18-Jul-19,12:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-18/forming-and-fueling-galaxies/,"Galaxies steadily form new stars and merge with other galaxies; they also steadily leak stars and gas. Less well known is how galaxies continue to acquire gas to feed the sustained creation of new stars over billions of years or even how this gas surrounding galaxies moves. Published in The Astrophysical Journal, a new paper from UCSB researchers explores the environment of galaxies to help answer these questions. ""Scientists don't understand very well how galaxies can continue to get additional fuel over cosmic timescales. Our study was about trying to find the reservoir of gas that feeds galaxies like the Milky Way,""ù Crystal Martin, a professor in UCSB's Department of Physics, said. Martin and graduate student Stephanie Ho were among the investigators to study the behavior of the gas surrounding galaxies ""î circumgalactic gas ""î and its effect on galaxies. To do so, they used bright beacons of light emitted from quasars, supermassive black holes, behind galaxies. As the light from quasars travels through the halo gas surrounding the galaxy, the gas absorbs some of the light at a specific wavelength based on its chemical composition. Martin and her team measured these wavelengths to identify the location and size of 50 nearby galaxies. They also tracked the activity of circumgalactic gas, observing small velocity shifts at several 100,000s of kilometers per second. ""We use [the spectra] to tell whether a given type of gas is moving toward us or moving away from us,""ù Martin said. Wavelengths from halo gas in approaching galaxies appear bluer. In retreating galaxies, they appear redder. Called the Doppler shift, this physics phenomenon is also observed when an approaching train whistle has a higher pitch that then drops when the train passes by. ""In our case, we're dealing with light, which is electromagnetic waves instead of sound waves. But the Doppler shift is the same principle: Frequency is high when [the gas] is approaching, and the frequency is low when it's moving away,""ù Martin explained. The researchers discovered that much of the halo gas is spinning and ""in a direction that seems to know about the galactic disk.""ù The observation suggests that the disks seen in present-day galaxies developed from a similar gas as in older galaxies because they have the same rotation, Martin said. ""It strengthens the idea that circumgalactic gas is a reservoir of fuel out of which star-forming galaxies form.""ù Martin's research explored circumgalactic gas, including how its angular momentum influences the shape of galaxies, depicted in this artist's rendition of the Milky Way. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Moreover, the rotating activity of the halo gas determines the rotation of the galactic disk it forms. Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy, about 24,000 light-years away. The angular momentum associated with the orbital motion maintains our solar system's relative position, without which we would hurtle toward the galaxy's center. Martin uses the analogy of a figure skater to describe angular momentum: A spinning skater initially with outstretched arms begins to rotate faster when she quickly brings her arms to her chest. ""That's kind of the idea here, that we were detecting gas at large radii that has some angular momentum. And the gas falls in toward the galaxy due to gravity. This angular momentum is conserved, and it causes [the gas] to spin up, to rotate at higher velocities and form a disk,""ù Martin described. This creates the classic picture of the Milky Way galaxy ""î a spinning galactic disk with spiral arms ""î you might spot in a science textbook. Martin plans to further explore the circumgalactic gas. Its structure consists of a multi-phase medium which is similar to the atmosphere's, with clouds embedded within a smooth medium. While she has been investigating the motion of the colder clouds surrounding the galaxy, Martin is interested in more closely examining the hotter, diffuse medium. ""We would like to use other spectral lines that are in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum instead of the optical, that we probe [for] how this warmer component of the gas moves. We'd like to see if it is rotating the same way as the cold clouds,""ù she said.

science,The Art of Change: Dissecting the Role of Lobbying in Climate Policy,25-Jul-19,10:00 AM,['Natalie Overton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-25/the-art-of-change-dissecting-the-role-of-lobbying-in-climate-policy/,"Climate policy is a hot topic these days (pun intended). Yet, there's a sense of frustration that accompanies many discussions of climate-targeted legislation: why isn't anything happening? Is it gridlock? Is bipartisan climate legislation politically feasible or even desirable? What will it take to change our world for the better from the top down?† For the first time in a while, we seem to have some answers.† In the Bren-based Environmental Market Solutions Lab (emLab), UCSB-affiliated researchers Kyle Meng and Ashwin Rode have some big ideas brewing, as seen in their study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.† The subject of their analysis is the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill, also known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). This bill was, and still is, the piece of climate regulation in the U.S. that has come the closest to becoming law ""î it's the only one that has passed either house of Congress. Using some pretty clever data analysis, Meng and Rode were able to measure exactly how the Waxman-Markey bill was affected by the lobbying money surrounding its approval in the House and its no-show in the Senate.† Here's their main finding: Lobbying by various public firms lowered the probability of Congress passing the ACES by 13%. And because it wasn't enacted, Meng and Rode found an expected social cost of $60 billion.† The study also notes a few other significant findings. Firstly, Meng and Rode show that there is a statistically significant relationship between the amount of money a firm puts into lobbying the bill and how much the said firm expects its stock values will increase or decrease if the bill is enacted. Simply put, if a firm expects the bill to greatly affect its stock value, it will put more money into lobbying that bill. This is illustrated in the graph pictured below, pulled from their published paper.† The relationship between lobbying spending on the Waxman-Markey bill and change in firm-level stock value is depicted, with the solid line showing a linear fit and the shaded area showing an associated 90% confidence interval. / Courtesy of Nature Climate Change Second, in this case at least, losers win.† Meng and Rode write, ""Our statistical analysis suggests that firms that are expected to lose [money] are more effective at lobbying to lower the policy's chances than firms that are expected to gain [money] are at lobbying to raise the policy's chances.""ù† Finally, whether or not these firms are pro- or anti-bill, the more they lobby, the less they get. Meng and Rode refer to this pattern as ""diminishing returns to lobbying.""ù† Most importantly, though, Meng and Rode's study provides sorely needed insight into climate policy's optimal politically successful form.† ""In particular, we demonstrate [""¶] how more sophisticated targeting of which firms get free permits under a cap-and-trade programme can increase the probability of policy enactment,""ù Meng and Rode write. In the ""na√Øve""ù carbon trading permit allocation scenario, free permits are distributed evenly to all the tested firms ""î the winners and the losers. This effectively eliminates the competition between firms that incentivizes opposition to these climate policies.† The figure depicts the likelihood of policy enactment under various free permit allocation schemes. / Courtesy of Nature Climate Change This approach's effect is depicted in the gray line on the graph pictured above. The paper shows that even the ""na√Øve""ù approach is effective. Even better is the ""sophisticated""ù scenario, in which the firms that lose the least (aren't as sorely affected) get fewer permits than those who lose more (are more affected by the policy). This scenario, represented by the brown line on the graph, maximizes the probability of the policy being enacted.† This important research sheds light on why the ACES bill failed and, to some great relief, how to navigate the issue of interest groups' moneyed involvement in politics.† Meng and Rode have struck gold, providing those interested in progressive climate change legislation with a reason for optimism and the beginnings of a path toward making that optimism a reality.

Purple sea urchins / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Documented in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, researchers with UCSB's Marine Science Institute (MSI), led by postdoctoral scholar Christie Yorke, have found that urchins have a beneficial role in the circulation of smaller particles throughout the kelp forest ecosystem: acting as shredders, processing coarse organic matter for other detritivores and retaining this resource in the living system.† ""There were some existing papers suggesting that urchin feces had a relatively high caloric content relative to fresh kelp. There were these novel compounds present in urchin feces that maybe weren't present in fresh kelp, suggesting that they could be a valuable food source to reef consumers, but there was nobody actually showing that that pathway existed,""ù Yorke said.†† In 2015, Yorke began designing an experiment to support or disprove the existence of this pathway. By labeling kelp with heavy stable isotopes, carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 specifically, and tracing the movement of these isotopes throughout the food web, she and her collaborators were able to gauge how much of an impact urchins had on their ecosystems.† ""We fed this kelp to urchins, and we had these tanks with a presence or absence of urchins and kelp in them. We were able to trace that level through other invertebrate communities that were in spaces that were in the tank,""ù Yorke said.† They found that the movement of these isotopes from one trophic level to another was to a large degree contingent on the presence of urchins.† ""I ran that experiment for about a month, and then I dissected all of the animals and did isotope analysis on all of their tissues. I was able to run that through a statistical model to estimate the proportion of their tissue that was comprised of labeled kelp, and I was able to compare the two treatments.""ù In environments with more urchins present, there was a much higher percentage of labeled kelp which had been digested. ""A lot of these animals that live on the seafloor and kelp forests are unable to use kelp unless it's been processed by urchins. They can't just use kelp that's not naturally degrading on the floor. They're able to utilize it better when urchins are present,""ù Yorke said. Urchins, being inefficient digesters, have a twofold effect, breaking down kelp into more manageable components for detritivores and having a gut microbiome which synthesizes essential nutrients not present in undigested kelp.† The most common recipients of urchin-processed kelp included brittle stars and other more active feeders.† ""Sea stars and really active barnacles that might live on reefs that are kind of actively filtering larger particles out of the water, and anything that's kind of in the sediments and feeding from the sediments themselves, is most likely to benefit from the presence of urchins,""ù Yorke explained.† An illustrated example of shredders in a stream ecosystem, which inspired Yorke to study shredders in marine ecosystems. / Courtesy of Christie Yorke Yorke was inspired by scientific literature she encountered which examined the benefits of shredders on stream environments and wanted to explore this concept through the lens of marine life.† ""I hadn't been able to find anyone looking at that concept in marine systems. They are a lot more difficult to study. Streams have like this linear flow, right. You can easily see the differences from one end to the other, whereas marine systems have these complex flow regimes, and it's [a] more three-dimensional, chaotic environment. It was just a matter of figuring out an experiment to where I could look at that,""ù Yorke said.† Outside of these lab experiments, the researchers made use of long term data from the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Project to further support their hypothesis.† ""We looked at urchin biomass and leaf litter availability in kelp biomass over time, a period of about 11 years, to show along with our measured lab feeding rates that urchins are abundant and present within kelp forests,""ù Yorke stated.† ""Based on these feeding rates and the fact that litter is not limiting, urchins are producing enough feces and shredded kelp to provide a meaningful food source for reef communities when compared to other potential sources of foods such as phytoplankton, other detritus and other benthic algae.""ù Knowing this, Yorke argues that perhaps it is a good idea to reexamine how urchins are dealt with and treated by conservationists.† ""The logical next step is to question whether or not management practices such as smashing sea urchins are, are based in science,""ù Yorke said. ""I think we need to do more work to understand the whole view of the kelp forest ecosystem and the roles that different species play in them before we try to actively manage systems by culling urchins or other animals that we feel might be harmful for kelp forests.""ù

Karp Discovery Award. The prestigious award is ""intended to provide seed funding to the most exceptional young postdocs at UC Santa Barbara early in their careers and support their innovative research,""ù its description states. Taylor works in UCSB assistant psychology professor Emily Jacobs' lab, which examines how sex hormones Å†""î and in particular, how changes in sex hormones Å†""î impact the brain. While Jacobs mainly studies the cognitive and physical impacts of the menopausal transition in the brain, Taylor's line of research focuses on hormone-brain effects in younger adulthood. ""Instead of having some sort of internal trigger to trigger the change in hormones like [in] menopause, I'm asking what changes [occur] or do we see an effect on the brain ""¶ if someone takes birth control pills, which is an external source of hormones that stops the production of endogenous hormones in the body,""ù Taylor said. Naturally, sex hormones, including estrogen, progesterone and testosterone, play essential roles in major life stages such as puberty and menopause. In the brain, they typically impact areas involving learning, memory and higher-order thinking, such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. Thanks to the Karp grant, Taylor now has dedicated funding for developing the large-scale brain imaging database called the UC Women's Brain Initiative. ""I can focus 100% on getting this database off the ground and really growing it to the size that we are projecting it to be,""ù she said. The researchers are studying the impacts of oral hormonal contraception on the brain. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The idea for the initiative emerged when the researchers recognized there was not yet any consistent replication across current, public studies on the short- and long-term effects of the birth control pill on the brain.† One concern was the surplus of uncontrolled factors that may affect the impacts of oral hormonal contraception on the brain, including when someone started taking the pill, how long they remain on the pill and what formulation of the pill they use. In looking at existing neuroimaging data consortia, Taylor found that there was an inadequate amount of information collected about people's reproductive health and hormone history, including usage of the pill.  Taylor also identified the issue of relatively small sample sizes, which is ""an issue with most neuroimaging studies,""ù she noted. ""It's difficult to get the number of people involved that you need to really see robust effects.""ù† To effectively approach these studies, the researchers aim to amass large numbers of data by capitalizing on belonging to the larger UC system. ""So we decided, OK, we're part of the UC system; we have people coming, people using our neuroimaging centers to conduct studies ""î why don't we try and pool our data across the system and leverage the power of the numbers that we recruit across the UC? And why don't we develop a database that is dedicated to asking the questions of women's health that have been overlooked in these other databases?""ù Taylor described. The researchers plan to have all eight UC campuses with a neuroimaging system participate in the initiative. / Courtesy of UC Women's Brain Initiative Taylor and Jacobs are implementing their initiative in phases, with a goal to expand the database to all eight UC campuses with a research-dedicated Brain Imaging Center. Annually, it's estimated that around 10,000 unique participants will contribute their data. The first phase began at UCSB, in which their fellow investigators are gathering data from willing participants. UC Berkeley has already joined UCSB in the initiative so that volunteers at either campus' brain-imaging center will have their data added to the shared, centralized data repository. Participants also fill out an online questionnaire about their general health history, use of hormones and reproductive health history. The information is de-identified so that no one in the dataset can be personally identified. ""And so by collecting their [brain] structural scans and their questionnaire data, we're then building this database where we can ask questions about hormone use or reproductive health history and any correlations with brain structure,""ù Taylor said. So far, the initiative has collected over 200 data points from males and females. The researchers' current efforts are figuring out the logistics of sharing and accessing the data across campuses. They then plan to form an advisory committee and grow the database with the remaining UC campuses with neuroimaging centers. As the recipient of the Karp Discovery Award, Taylor found her win to be ""very exciting.""ù ""It was really gratifying and rewarding just because I find this work to be really important, and I think that there has been a trend in science and just in the public eye recently that women's health studies ""î studying the female brain ""î has been overlooked or hasn't really been approached to the extent that we've studied the male brain,""ù she said. ""And so, I think this focus on asking the question about what happens when we take the pill, asking that question has been overdue.""ù ""I think it's important that we ask questions that are relevant to women's health, and so winning the Karp Award was a nice validation of that reason and a recognition that other people also value that line of questioning.""ù

The World Bank estimated that 62% of all seafood will come from aquaculture by 2030.† Global seafood consumption has more than doubled in the past 50 years, putting a strain on Earth's oceans and incentivizing the need for reliable seafood production. Currently, 90% of all seafood in the United States is imported, suggesting a large potential market for domestic seafood production. California is one of the states with the highest seafood demands and an expansive coastline, making it a prime candidate for sustainable seafood production.† However, with such a large potential comes a lot of questions, and for UCSB researcher and Ph.D. candidate Jade Sainz, aquaculture became her main academic interest.† ""I became even more aware of the importance of aquaculture for seafood production and jobs, but also I noticed the many challenges that the farmers face, and also the problems we need to solve as managers to ensure aquaculture sustainability,""ù Sainz said.† Her research, published recently in Frontiers in Marine Science, used historical environmental data collected from 1981 to 2008 and reanalysis data to predict the profitability of 223 hypothetical mussel farms along the coast from Point Conception to the Mexico border in a region known as the Southern California Bight.† The researchers studied mussel farms in the coastal region of the Southern California Bight, highlighting variability in productivity at three representative regions over a 27-year period. / Courtesy of Frontiers in Marine Science The study used particulate organic carbon, temperature, current velocity and mixed-layer depth as biological parameters which were then fitted to predict how the uptake of light, food, nutrients, etc. would manifest in thriving mussel populations. There is a significant ecological relationship between the variability of the sea and the effect it has on the mussels, the paper found.† To show the effects of environmental variability on economic value, the Net Present Value (NPV), commonly used in economics and finance, was used as an economic indicator. NPV takes into account investments and the cost of running the mussel farm, minus the cash flow derived from the profits of the farm.† The study additionally focused on how climate variability, including oceanic fluctuations such as the Northern Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), can have a substantial impact on the productivity of aquaculture. A strong correlation existed between the ocean's fluctuations and the success of these mussel farms, with the NPGO serving ""as the main driver for mussel productivity.""ù† The research found the best locations for maintaining a stable productive mussel farm despite these changes were between Point Conception and Los Angeles. Farms in the north proved to have a faster recovery time from the effects of the NPGO. Additionally, the study reported ""that productivity in the center region is unstable compared to the North (with high productivity) and the South (lower productivity).""ù It was thought that the reason the southern region had lower productivity was due to warm currents coming from the south.  The study showed that the NPGO has a large impact on mussel production, but why doesn't another large oscillation, such as the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, have such a significant effect as well? ""The NPGO explains variation of nutrient dynamics in Southern California so this is why this climate trends have relevance for mussels,""ù Sainz explained. Also according to Sainz, being decadal trends, the two climate patterns can overlap or influence dynamics.† ""Having a Ni√±o year means that these effects will overlap with the NPGOs, causing a major or minor effect on mussels depending on the phase of the NPGO,""ù Sainz stated.† This could be due in part to rain patterns produced by El Ni√±o that supply nutrients and particles through runoff to the mussels, which could have a big impact on their populations.† While scientific research can help guide the way to a more sustainable future it is difficult to predict how aquaculture may be affected by the impacts of climate change.† ""Climate change is expected to change the atmospheric and ocean mechanisms that regulate climate, including Pacific decadal variability. There is a lot of uncertainty of how this will happen, but according to the body of research on the topic, the variance of these decadal trends tend to increase under anthropogenic forcing,""ù Sainz said.

Throughout the center's history, it has saved tens of thousands of animals' lives. The Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network (SBWCN) has cared for a whopping 170 different species. Last year, in 2018, it cared for a total of 3,297 patients; this year, it has already taken in over 3,100 patients. ""The only things we are not allowed to care for are adult deer, adult coyotes, wild boar, bears, mountain lions, seals and sea lions. But every other bird, mammal and non-venomous reptile we can care for at the center,""ù Claire Garvais, communications and development coordinator at SBWCN and UCSB Class of 2018 graduate, said.† That includes pelicans, raccoons, bobcats, hummingbirds, owls and many other species beyond the common duck, opossum and corvid. When an animal is found, SBWCN recommends putting the animal in a quiet, dark and warm padded box with holes for air to let the animal calm down, refraining from giving the animal food and water and bringing it to the wildlife care center. The animal can be handed off directly at the center ""î at 1460 N. Fairview Ave. in Goleta ""î or someone from a team of volunteer transporters can come pick the animal up. ""Animal cruelty is pretty rare around here, and most of the animals that come in are injured by car strikes, cat attacks or window strikes. Those are the three biggest things [why animals come in]. And many are just babies that fall out of the nest a little bit too early,""ù Garvais explained.† Spring and summer are the height of wildlife baby season, so that's when the center sees the biggest spike in numbers of patients on site. Garvais shares some of the more intense rescue stories she's seen in her time with SBWCN. The great-horned owl injured by barbed wire during the Thomas Fire in 2017. / Courtesy of Ojai Raptor Center Back in December of 2017, off in Buellton, a male great-horned owl had been caught on barbed wire. SBWCN was able to remove the barbed wire piercing through his wing and stabilize him. SBWCN needed to get him to the Ojai Raptor Center for specialized care. This was during the Thomas Fire when roads were closed, so getting him down there was a puzzle. ""The 101 was closed because of the Thomas Fire ""¶ [so] we weren't able to drive him down. So we asked our friends over at the Condor Express whale-watching boat if they would take this great-horned owl aboard the boat and transport him down to Ventura, and they did! ""¶ A driver was able to get him from Ventura to Ojai, and the owl rehabilitated well at the Ojai Raptor Center and was released! It was really cool. Garvais also recalls the story in 2018 of a great blue heron that had been shot four times with a BB gun and was rushed to the care center. Sitting on her nest in Lompoc, the heron had been about to lay an egg.† The great blue heron helped by SBWCN. / Courtesy of Jessie Zamichow ""Herons never lay eggs in captivity. So we were really worried, trying to get her better and out, so that she could lay her egg. We hatched a GoFundMe to try to pay for her surgery, and it was really successful; we raised all the funds we needed to in less than 24 hours, and she got a surgery. All the pellets were removed, and she was looking a lot better,""ù Garvais said.† As for the health of the egg, the heron was less fortunate. ""Unfortunately, the egg had already died inside of her. But we were able to release her back into a safe area of Lompoc, and she flew away just fine after two and a half weeks of care.

SBWCN also gives rescuers the opportunity to reach out and check in on the animal's health.  Many wildlife rescues have occurred in Isla Vista. Here are some animal rescue stories from local community members. Most common animals at SBWCN / Courtesy of SBWCN Sarah's Squirrel Sarah Cortez, a resident of Isla Vista, brought in a squirrel during the colder rain month of February. She was walking her dog, Ben, who loves sniffing out ground squirrels, along the Del Sol Vernal Pool Reserve. When he hovered over the same spot for a long time, Cortez went to investigate and found a squirrel stiff from being cold. ""The squirrel was soaking wet, breathing slowly, eyes closed and had its arms extended straight out, almost as if it was reaching for air. It was still alive but never opened its eyes or moved apart from breathing,""ù Cortez said. A Facebook post from Cortez asking for advice received responses to contact the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network, who told Cortez to put the squirrel in a box with soft padding and openings for air, and bring her over to the center. SBWCN offers updates on the animals brought in, and Cortez reached out and learned from them that the squirrel, bone-cold from the storms, would have passed away if not for her. Two days after being taken in, the squirrel was released back into the wild. ""She was released back into the same field she came from which made me extremely happy, because I was concerned she would be taken from her possible squirrel friends and family. Me and my dog, Ben, walk through that same field every single day and like to think that she is one of the squirrels we constantly see running around.""ù Minsu's Del Playa Seagull Minsu Kim, another Isla Vista resident, found a seagull on the ground in his backyard on Del Playa that sported head wounds and couldn't stand or fly. Unsure of what to do, Kim texted one of his friends who was involved with SBWCN. He followed his friend's advice and put the gull in a cardboard box lined with a towel for shelter overnight, and even though it was after hours, called SBWCN and left a voicemail. At 8 a.m. the next morning, a volunteer transporter came to bring the gull to SBWCN. Unfortunately the gull didn't make it, but Kim described the experience as positive.

science,UCSB Researchers Examine Effective Communication of Environmental Issues,4-Sep-19,9:45 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-04/ucsb-researchers-examine-effective-communication-of-environmental-issues/,"Countless times, we've heard communication is key. For environmental issues, there's no exception. The researchers' study on effectiveness of messaging frames for invasive species management used the example of wild pigs. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Published in PLOS ONE, a recent paper from Alex DeGolia, a 2017 UCSB Ph.D. graduate; Elizabeth Hiroyasu, a Ph.D. candidate at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management; and Sarah Anderson, an associate professor of environmental politics at the Bren School, investigates how environmental managers can frame messages about environmental issues to more effectively garner public support. ""We were interested in knowing if there were ways to talk about invasive species management policies or practices that were being put into place that would increase support for that management action,""ù Hiroyasu explained. To test this, the researchers gave different messages about hypothetical management of invasive wild pigs to a survey of over 1,000 California residents. Set up to look like press releases from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the statements were conveyed using ecological or economic frames and highlighted either benefits or losses. The ecological attribute frames described effects of an action or non-action on the environment, and effects of the invasive species on the environment. The ecological gain message discussed facilitating benefits to native ecosystems such as soil nutrient cycling from the pigs' foraging, Hiroyasu said. The ecological loss treatment focused on averting losses to native habitats, including preventing water pollution caused by the wild pigs wallowing in water. In terms of the economic attribute frames, the research team talked about management actions based on monetary values. The economic gain treatment emphasized an increase in economic production and tax revenue from implementation of the management program; the economic cost message stressed loss of economic production such as crop damage if the pigs invaded agricultural fields or from digging up golf courses. The paper's ""surprising""ù main finding, according to Hiroyasu, was that ecological messages, both positively and negatively framed, were significantly more effective at motivating the public to support invasive species management than economic messages were. ""I think that that's particularly interesting because in the environmental field in particular, we talk a lot about how we need to be talking about the economics of any kind of environmental action because people [often] care more about their pocketbooks or they want to know in terms of dollar amounts ""î a more tangible way to think about problems. And we just didn't find that to be the case in this for wild pig management,""ù she said. The study additionally reports that frames highlighting loss prevention were more effective than frames highlighting achieving gains. This confirmed the investigators' hypothesis that people's reactions would follow prospect theory, or ""loss-aversion""ù theory. Also used in economics, the concept submits that people are more emotionally impacted by losses than by equivalent gains, that ""the psychological effect of losing $100 is greater than the positive effect of gaining $100,""ù the authors write.† The paper's results show that ""the public is more concerned with managing invasive species for intrinsic environmental worth than economic benefit and that preventing further environmental degradation is more motivating than promoting additional environmental gains.""ù Hiroyasu and her colleagues performed subgroup analysis of the study's participants, notably political ideology. In discussing the ""really politicized arena""ù of climate change, people often look to their political party in deciding whether to support certain policies, Hiroyasu pointed out. This led the researchers to predict that different frames would vary in effectiveness depending on the political leanings of the message's recipient. But their findings suggest that the same types of messaging frames can be effectively used to communicate to conservatives and liberals, rather than speaking to each group individually. ""We can talk to everybody at once with one single message, and so that is more efficient for [environmental] managers,""ù Hiroyasu noted. Although much of previous work related to message framing and the environment has been focused on climate change issues, Hiroyasu described focusing on messaging surrounding the less politically-charged issue of invasive species management as ""really exciting.""ù ""Invasive species management, or even wildlife management more generally ""¶ can be real opportunities to talk either across those party lines or to message multiple parties at the same time,""ù she stated. Since public sway can affect the rollout of policies, Hiroyasu stressed the importance of being able to communicate environmental issues efficiently to gain public support. ""Invasive species are particularly difficult and can [create] very time-sensitive problems. And so public support can be really crucial to making sure that any kind of management on the ground is effective,""ù she said. Hiroyasu is next thinking about what aspects of invasive species are important when it comes to message framing for supporting invasive species management, such as introduction pathways. Invasive species can be introduced in two major ways: intentionally by humans or unintentionally by humans. With the effects of climate change, many more species are shifting their spatial distributions ""î including some that may not be expected to become invasive. Some species are even moving without human assistance, according to Hiroyasu. ""We're interested in knowing how that method of introduction interacts with talking about the ecological or economic consequences ""î again, those attribute frames for supporting management.""ù

science,"Epigenetics, Corals and Climate Change",12-Sep-19,9:30 AM,['Hannah Hirou'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/epigenetics-corals-and-climate-change/,"Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems distinguished by reef-building coral. They are often thought of as the ""rainforests of the sea,""ù famous for their beautiful colors and thousands of varieties of aquatic animals. In recent years, the public has become aware of the threat that climate change has presented to these sensitive ecosystems. The poster child of this is the Great Barrier Reef, which has lost more than half its coral since 1985 as of 2012.† Studying how these reefs are responding to a changing ocean is a vital step in learning how these and other organisms may respond to climate change.†† Unfortunately the negative impacts that climate change could have on coral reefs have not been fully realized.† UC Santa Barbara ecologist Holly Moeller wants people to realize the importance of coral reefs to make their conservation more effective. ""Despite how vibrant a healthy reef can appear, these ecosystems can be delicate when it comes to stress. And unfortunately the sources of stress are many for a reef: they can be poisoned by pollution, bleached by hotter temperatures, damaged by overfishing, and dissolved by a more acidic ocean. Even well-meaning visitors can damage the reef when they stand on or touch the corals,""ù Moeller said in an email.† Moeller and other marine scientists received a $3 million, five-year funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to set up long-term research on the coral reefs around Moorea in French Polynesia.† Prospectively, UCSB Theoretical Ecologist Roger Nisbet, Moeller and researchers from many different universities will be studying coral epigenetics in Moorea, where the NSF operates the Moorea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) project.† Epigenetics is the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression, rather than an alteration of the genetic code itself. It is a dynamic method that allows an organism to react phenotypically to its environment by essentially expressing certain genes in response to its environment. Genes can be silenced by another gene, for example, but it becomes a problem if the expressed allele is damaged or contains a variant that increases the organism's vulnerability to microbes, toxic agents or other harmful substances. These are the factors that could challenge a coral's survival. Thus, studying the epigenetic response coral reefs have to their environment could tell an abundance about their biology in regard to climate change. One potential source of stress for coral reefs is bleaching. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Coral reefs have blossomed against the odds in the past. It may seem counterintuitive but the warm waters of the tropics are often nutrient poor, lacking the nutrients of colder waters that are rich with phytoplankton and zooplankton that sustain a vast array of ocean life.† Coral circumnavigates this problem by forming a mutualistic relationship with zooxanthellae algae. The glucose the algae makes from photosynthesis feeds the coral animal in exchange for a home in a calcium carbonate castle.† ""Together, this coral-algal partnership creates a physical structure where other organisms can gain a foothold, find a place to hide or go to forage for food. Even open ocean species, like pelagic fish and sharks, will stop by coral reefs!""ù Moeller explained. As ocean acidity levels rise it puts stress on these algae that could cause them to die in a phenomenon known as coral bleaching. With coral reefs being the anchoring point for the complexity of life in tropical waters it should come with great alarm that coral bleaching threatens their existence as ocean acidification increases. However, the research to come is not limited to just the effects of ocean acidification.† ""Our work is trying to address basic scientific questions about how corals respond to changing environments, and how fast they can do it. So in that sense our goal is pretty broad, but we may indeed find some signs of how corals might be able to (or might not be able to) adapt to future ocean conditions,""ù Moeller said.†

science,Evaluating Cumulative Human Impacts on Marine Ecosystems,19-Sep-19,9:00 AM,['Hannah Hirou'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/evaluating-cumulative-human-impacts-on-marine-ecosystems/,"As climate change rapidly makes its impact on the world, the existing scientific data monitoring and evaluating what changes are occurring and what impact they have may struggle to keep up.† Due to the sensitive nature of marine ecosystems, the impacts of climate change are far-reaching for marine aquatic life. A fundamental gap in understanding how humanity is affecting the oceans is our limited knowledge about the pace of change in cumulative impacts on ocean ecosystems. What's more is the need to find out the locations, drivers and patterns of these changes.† Recently, UCSB researchers, including Benjamin Halpern and Melanie Frazier, and a Stanford University researcher, published their paper ""Recent pace of change in human impact on the world's ocean""ù in Scientific Reports which addressed for the first time the combined impact humans are having on our marine ecosystems. ""To assess the pace of change in cumulative human impacts (CHI) we calculated and mapped the cumulative impact of 14 stressors related to human activities (including climate change, fishing, land-based pressures, and other commercial activities) on 21 different marine ecosystems globally for each of eleven years spanning 2003""ì2013,""ù Halpern and Frazier reported in their study.† The 14 stressors included ocean acidification, sea surface temperature, sea level rise, shipping, nutrient pollution, organic pollution, direct human, light pollution, commercial fishing (five types) and artisanal fishing. ""We found that most of the ocean (59%) is experiencing significantly increasing cumulative impact, in particular due to climate change but also from fishing, land-based pollution and shipping,""ù Halpern and Frazier wrote in their groundbreaking study.†† These findings beg the question: What aspects of climate change have caused a doubling of impacts on sensitive marine ecosystems like coral reefs and mangroves?† According to Frazier, ""increasing greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in large increases in ocean temperature which impact many ocean habitats and animals.""ù Figure a shows the calculated annual CHI change with red indicating more change and blue indicating less change. Figure b shows the CHI in 2013. / Courtesy of Scientific Reports High sea surface temperatures (SST) account for 75% of CHI, making it the largest influencer globally. However, high SSTs along coastal ecosystems only account for 40% of CHI, while increasing sea level explained 41% of the increasing CHI. ""Furthermore, the consequences of increasing temperature are compounded by the resulting loss of sea ice and rising sea levels. In addition to warming, carbon dioxide emissions also cause ocean acidification,""ù Frazier stated in an email. In areas with low cumulative impact such as the Indian, Mid-Atlantic and Western Pacific Oceans, increased SST accounted for most of the CHI increase. Despite the many alarming findings of the study, a handful of countries, including areas of Europe, Asia and parts of Africa, saw declines in the impacts caused by commercial fishing and land-based pollution. ""Some countries were able to stabilize, or even slow, the impact of some of the stressors on their ocean waters. This suggests that good policies can definitely contribute to improved ocean health,""ù Frazier asserted. Creating policies is rather hard-pressed in countries where economic and social viability under the current infrastructure is indirectly associated with destroying the environment. ""One of the best actions we could take to slow down our impact on oceans is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is challenging because it requires concerted action among many countries, and the political motivation to achieve this goal is depressingly low in many places,""ù Frazier said. Along with SST, ocean acidification played the second-largest role in increasing the cumulative human impact on average. Most countries saw an increase in ocean acidification by 99% during the study period. This increase was not alone; other areas where high changes occurred were shipping with a 92% increase and direct human impact with a 70% increase. ""A reduction in carbon dioxide would also help prevent further ocean acidification, which can be damaging to certain ocean animals,""ù Frazier addressed. Ocean acidification is one of the largest threats to coral reefs which were among the most affected marine ecosystems along with sea grasses and mangroves.† Greenhouse gases remain one of the largest obstacles to overcome despite the numerous others.† The study detailed that the Paris Agreement would have a tremendous impact on the state of many marine ecosystems and significantly slow or halt the increasing trend of cumulative human impact.† As far as policies go, Halpern elaborated that, ""there are a huge number of possibilities, because the different impacts come from almost every sector of human activity, on land and in the sea.† So there are lots of options.""ù Nonetheless, there are many variables that are known stressors that the study mentioned it did not include due to difficult data sourcing such as deep sea mining, plastic pollution, offshore energy, aquaculture, noise pollution, terrestrial mining, logging and oil spills.† As far as making a difference as climate change takes its course, Frazier added, "" I (mostly) haven't lost hope that we can come together to improve the situation.""ù

science,UCSB Researchers Discover Mechanism Potentially Accelerating Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease,19-Sep-19,2:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/ucsb-researchers-discover-mechanism-potentially-accelerating-progression-of-polycystic-kidney-disease/,"PKD progression is depicted, with a normal kidney represented on the right side of each diagram for comparison. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disorder causing clusters of cysts to form in the kidneys that may lead to eventual kidney failure. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) makes up about 90% of all PKD cases and affects over 600,000 Americans and 12.4 million people worldwide. Individuals with PKD can face symptoms such as elevated blood pressure, possible development of cysts in other organs like the liver, higher chances to develop brain aneurysms and kidney stones and chronic side or back pain. Although there is currently no cure for PKD, numerous supportive treatments and lifestyle changes may help control symptoms and slow down or reduce loss of kidney function. Much research is being done on PKD, including in Thomas Weimbs' lab at UCSB. In their paper published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the lab members identify a tubule dilation mechanism that may accelerate the formation of kidney cysts. Based on diet, our metabolism results in the formation of different substances such as calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate and uric acid. Microcrystal versions of these molecules are produced daily and get harmlessly excreted through normal kidney function. But for individuals with a propensity to form kidney stones, crystal deposits can get lodged in renal tubules. This may lead to kidney stone formation and cause health complications. ""You can imagine that if you're trying to filter the urine out ""î and the kidney has a lot of tubes ""î and if the kidney stones get stuck in any of these tubes, the kidney would stop working. There wouldn't be any kidney function equivalent to filter any more urine out. So there has to be a way to deal with these little microcrystals before they become stones,""ù Jacob Torres, a postdoctoral researcher in the Weimbs' lab and the lead author of the study, said. The scientists found that in response to calcium oxalate crystal deposition, a protective mechanism is triggered in which renal tubules dilate to flush out these lodged crystals. While researchers in the natural sciences field studying kidney stones have observed dilated tubules before, ""it has not previously been recognized as an active protective mechanism,""ù the paper states. The fact that the tubules dilate and how or why the dilation happens hadn't been thoroughly analyzed until now. The endogenous crystal clearing mechanism was ""kind of unlooked at up to this point,""ù Torres said.†† Their findings further show that calcium phosphate deposition led to increased cyst formation and PKD progression. Calcium oxide crystal deposition in mice activated mTOR and Src/Stat3 signaling pathways accompanying tubule dilation. ""In a lot of diseases, mTOR is dysregulated because it's either overactive or underactive. Most of these are overactive diseases like cancer or PKD ""î that's when mTOR is doing too much. And that kind of tells cells that they can grow and proliferate,""ù Torres explained.† The study reports that blocking mTOR signaling diminished tubule dilation and stopped effective crystal excretion. This suggests that these pathways are implicated in ADPKD and renal cyst growth, the investigators wrote. Courtesy of the Journal of Clinical Investigation Additionally, their results conclude that this protective mechanism can be a ""third-hit""ù trigger accelerating PKD progression through causing dilated tubules to ""overshoot""ù to form cysts. Reminiscent to the third-hit model in the cancer field, the concept expresses that mutations ""accumulate on top of each other""ù before individual cysts form in ADPKD, Torres described. The first hit occurs when a gene responsible for ADPKD gets mutated, either in PKD1 or PKD2. After several gene mutations and potentially through an environmental stressor, a somatic mutation may occur in a renal tubule cell (the second hit) and cause or continue a disease through a kidney insult, triggering a repair response (the third hit). ""There's a lot of debate about what kind of sufficient trigger is the cause [of the third hit],""ù Torres said. ""Studies show that now you need to have an injury on top of that second [hit] in order to cause a cyst to form ""¶ And so our research is kind of building on that idea that microcrystals are acting as that third hit, the ""òsome other injury' trigger that's causing the cyst to form.""ù The protective mechanism ""is probably broken in PKD,""ù according to Torres. ""And then that might be a way to prevent the progressive decline of kidney function by minimizing or mitigating the crystal burden that patients have. So it kind of leads to a therapy or therapeutic approach for individuals that have PKD.""ù Potential treatments such as modifying diet can help reduce kidney stone formation and crystal deposition, Torres said. Taking steps like drinking less soda, which contains high levels of phosphoric acid, and avoiding foods rich in uric acid or rich in oxalate such as spinach and beans, can help individuals with PKD. Increasing water intake and taking citrate supplements can also help. ""A big piece of the puzzle is because PKD is a genetic disease, there's probably not going to be a silver bullet where people can just take this one thing and it's going to fix everything. So it's probably going to be a bunch of behavioral stuff that people are gonna have to do ""¶ to make the biggest impact.

science,Mechanism to Develop Mineralized Skeletons Likely Evolved Independently Across Diverse Taxa,26-Sep-19,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/mechanism-to-develop-mineralized-skeletons-likely-evolved-independently-across-diverse-taxa/,"Paleontologists at UCSB, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, have shed light on how biomineralization, the mechanism by which mineralized skeletons develop, may have evolved independently among many different evolutionary lineages. The cephalopod and modern nautiloid Nautilus pompilius is an example of an organism that uses crystallization by particle attachment to form its shell, or mineralized skeleton. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America details how the researchers managed to pinpoint evidence of biomineralization in a wide variety of fossils from the Cambrian Period.† ""One of the most striking aspects of the Cambrian explosion is the independent appearance of mineralized skeletons after three billion years of life just making soft-bodied things,""ù Susannah Porter, a professor in the Department of Earth Science and co-author of the paper, said.† ""We see evidence for widespread controlled biomineralization, where the organism is actually directing the formation of the mineralized structure,""ù Porter said, a phenomenon unprecedented before the Cambrian. Over a period of 40 to 50 million years, all sorts of mineralized structures would spring up across wide swaths of taxa. The new article suggests that despite the fact that these organisms are not all that closely related, they share the same mechanism, known as crystallization by particle attachment, for biomineralization.† ""They use this interesting process where first they collect the materials for the mineral, either calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate, and store them in these vesicles in an amorphous form That means that if you were to look on the atomic level, the molecules aren't lining up in a nice crystal lattice, they're kind of all randomly mixed together,""ù Porter said.† These amorphous nanoparticles are stored in the vesicles until the body calls upon them to be used in a mineralized structure, at which point they are transferred to a site and the particles are attached together. ""Only recently has evidence been accumulating for this [process] going on in various different modern groups,""ù Porter said, citing taxa such as ""sea urchins, starfish, mollusks, modern corals, zebrafish bone and mouse tooth enamel.""ù Now the researchers have uncovered a morphological marker preserved in fossils which provides more evidence of crystallization by particle attachment having occurred all throughout the animal kingdom and across hundreds of millions of years. Even more significant, perhaps, is evidence which suggests that the mechanism evolved independently across different lineages.††† Impressions of the Australohalkieria sclerites forming the exoskeleton of the halkieriid are visible. / Courtesy of Susannah Porter ""The first author on the paper Pupa Gilbert, used techniques where she can see very high-resolution ""î on the 10s of nanometers-scale ""î mineral structures. What she has found is that even after these shells form, you can break them open and see this nanoparticulate texture in these shells,""ù Porter said.† ""The textures are very irregular textures rather than the regular shapes of crystals, with perfect angles or faces. The grains are all different sizes and different shapes.""ù Upon seeing these markers, Gilbert resolved to search for it in well-preserved fossils, enlisting the help of paleontologists such as Porter to acquire samples across a wide range of taxa and ""step back""ù in time.† Thus it was discovered that the irregular texture identified in modern mineral structures created through particle attachment was comparable to the texture found in fossilized remains from many taxa. The process of phosphatic fossilization ""î in which calcium carbonate structures are replaced by calcium phosphate ""î in very ancient organisms turned out to be a nonissue.† ""She cracked them open and she was able to find evidence for this nanoparticulate texture, and so then we said, ""òOh great! That suggests that the process of phosphatization isn't destroying this signal,'""ù Porter said. Gilbert and her colleagues would continue to observe this texture as more and more fossils came their way, evaluating specimens such as halkieriids, nautiloids and notably, specimens of Cloudina, recognized as one of the most ancient animals performing biomineralization, about 550 million years ago. ""We know that their skeletons are not homologous. Their last common ancestor did not make a skeleton They evolved skeletons† independently of one another and yet they appear to be using the same process,""ù Porter said. ""Way back when these organisms were first making mineralized skeletons, they used this same process of crystallization by particle attachment, and [today] it's the same. Maybe it's not a surprise that you would find the same process of biomineralization going on 550 million years ago as you do today, but still, it's a neat thing to figure out.""ù

UCSB is among 134 institutions which have been awarded with a gold rating or higher by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), out of the 970 campuses currently registered. AASHE's Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS), an assessment of campus sustainability efforts, is a set of criteria intended to guide institutions and provide a frame of reference to measure sustainability progress in ""all sectors of higher education,""ù according to the STARS 2.2 Technical Manual.†† STARS standards are organized into 19 categories, with 67 credits in total, and those credits further subdivided into individual points. These categories pertain to curriculum, research and the operations of the campus as a whole. For instance, in the category of Curriculum exists the credit AC 1, or Academic Courses, of which 14 points could potentially be earned. A campus earns points through sustainable practices related to a particular credit.† The criteria are closely aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a 15-year agenda with 169 targets meant to balance ""the three dimensions of sustainable development, the economic, social and environmental,""ù according to the manual. STARS may be used by an institution in order to gauge contributions to SDGs.†† UCSB placed ninth in the waste category through its efforts in waste management.

UCSB ranked also ranked ninth in the waste category, receiving 75.8% of the available points, compared to an average of 48%. This can be attributed to the significant progress the campus has made in regard to waste management. UCSB diverts 69% of its waste stream away from landfills through composting and recycling. In addition, programs have been established to recirculate food and clothing to those in need, providing a service and avoiding further waste.† ""665 students received 1,454 articles of free clothing from the Career Clothing Closet, a campus pop-up thrift store that provides students with free clothing for job interviews and the workplace,""ù Maynard said.† The first organics collection program in San Clemente Villages was also established last year, as a collaboration between Associated Students Recycling (ASR), the Bren School Sustainability Committee (BSSC) and Housing, Dining & Auxiliary Enterprises.† ""Last year BSSC and ASR worked together to recruit and educate 136 apartments and divert over 4.5 tons of compostable material from the landfill, thus reducing 3 metric tons of CO2-equivalent,""ù Maynard noted.

Investment and Finance include such credits as disclosure of investments, investor responsibility, and sustainable investment.† A 2018 Best Practice Award was presented to UCSB at the California Higher Education Sustainability Conference in Renewable Energy for their project to increase the renewable energy generating capacity of the campus tenfold, according to Maynard. A multi-site Power Purchase Agreement has solarized the energy mix, helping renewables generate one-third of the campus's peak electrical demand and 15% of the annual electrical consumption.† Furthermore, Scope One and Two greenhouse gas emissions ""î direct emissions from controlled sources, such as vehicles and equipment managed by the campus, and indirect sources from the generation of purchased power respectively, such as electricity bought from power grids ""î have fallen 21% from 2013. Overall, the campus has reduced the intensity of energy use by 19% over ten years.† Still, the work is far from over, and UCSB aims to reach Climate Neutrality, in which there would be no net release of carbon dioxide from scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025, according to Maynard.† UC Santa Barbara continues to make strides in environmental progressiveness, both at the administration and student level. In 2018, 83% of UCSB students voted to reaffirm The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF), a green fee created by students in 2006 intended to reduce UCSB's environmental impact with a lock-in fee.† ""In Spring TGIF allocated $191,364 to fund 20 student, faculty, and staff led projects,""ù Maynard wrote.† ""UCSB is committed to being a living laboratory for sustainability efforts where students can learn from their physical environment and local community in addition to learning in the classroom.""ù

science,Genetic Variation Can Affect Embryo Formation,3-Oct-19,8:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/genetic-variation-can-affect-embryo-formation/,"In a recent study published in eLife, UCSB scientists have found that while the end result of embryo formation may appear the same, the assembly instructions can vary widely between individuals of one species. Transgenic C. elegans expressing a red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the pharynx is shown. The gut lining is labelled by cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and the nuclei with green fluorescent protein (GFP). / Courtesy of Pradeep Joshi Specifically, researchers in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Professor Joel Rothman's lab and at the University of Auckland studied gene regulation affecting gut development in embryos of C. elegans, a nematode commonly used in scientific research. They tracked the development of the endoderm layer, which eventually gives rise to the entire gut. Two genes, skn-1 and mom-2, were thought to be key regulators in this process. ""When you're trying to assemble such a complex organism, you follow a sequence of instructions. You have a defined assembly manual and instruction manual to put things together,""ù Pradeep Joshi, a senior scientist in the Rothman lab and co-author of the paper, said. ""In specifying the gut, there are key transcription factors whose role has been shown to be extremely critical throughout evolution from Hydra to humans.""ù Because the hermaphrodite worm contains exactly 959 cells, the researchers can track the lineage and fate of each cell during embryonic formation. Using the technique of RNA interference (RNAi), they can selectively switch off the expression of native gene function. This allows for the rapid discovery of gene function. In observing this phenomenon in various strains of C. elegans, the investigators began seeing different phenotypes. Some animals developed no gut at all, indicating that the non-expressed genes were essential to their gut development. In others, a gut developed even when one of the critical components was knocked out, meaning these assumed critical genes didn't play an active role in building a gut. Think of it as if you had to make a souffle using a set list of ingredients while following a complicated recipe, Joshi said. ""And you were then told that you can make a souffle without one critical ingredient and it will still turn [out] just as fine. It will still be just as delicious, it will look just the same as if you had used all the other ingredients.""ù This discovery disrupted the scientists' understanding that these genes were absolutely required in nematode gut formation. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the underlying genetic circuitry can work differently between individuals of the same species but still produce similar results. ""[We] thought that evolution would act gradually and from species to species as they evolve. You can think of rewiring the genetic circuitry, the genetic network and then some genes become critical, some genes become less critical as they evolve. But to think that between individuals of a given species, to find such variation in how you are built, seems quite counterintuitive and was quite surprising to us,""ù Joshi stated. This may be nature's way to have built-in redundancy or a failsafe. It's similar to the idea that if the brakes of a car fail, the vehicle can still be stopped using the handbrake or ignition switch, Joshi described. ""Nature has incorporated a lot of failsafe mechanisms, redundancies, such that when something goes wrong, it can still get through and develop into a normal organism.""ù Because humans and other vertebrates share a common regulatory mechanism for endoderm development with nematodes, the study's results may have potential implications for drug therapies. If imagining RNAi as a drug to silence a particular gene function so that a protein is not made, it's as if you didn't need that particular protein, Joshi said. ""So then you're saying that this RNAi drug in some individuals has no effect on inhibiting gut development and in others, it has an absolute effect of inhibiting gut development.""ù ""This basically then gives us a window into why individual humans show such differences in responses to drugs,""ù he continued. The study may help explain why a drug may be noneffective in one patient but cause hypersensitive or even adverse reactions in another. ""It might not just be limited to how a particular drug is metabolized in individuals, but actually how the underlying genetic pathways function, say, in different cancers from different tumors in different patients,""ù Joshi explained. This fits in with the current age of personalized medicine. In treating cancer, for instance, it is becoming increasingly common for the tumor to be genotyped to see if certain biomarkers in critical genes are upregulated or downregulated as a tissue. This can help inform what effective therapy can be carried out for that particular patient, according to Joshi. ""It's no longer the standard that you come in and we'll blast you with radiation, we'll blast you with chemotherapy and then just randomly kill everything""¶now you see more gentle, more targeted treatments, less severe side effects and also we're seeing higher and higher success rates ""¶ [of] beating cancer,""ù he said. The Rothman lab plans to further investigate why some nematode individuals do not seem to require specific critical transcription factors for gut development while others do. Joshi hopes to also answer questions such as does this fundamental toolkit, because it is used in multiple scenarios including to specify the nervous system and muscle cells, modify other networks? Joshi said, ""Right now, we have just stumbled on the fact that, yes, the genetic pathways are vastly modified between individuals within the same species. That makes sense as to how has evolution acted on those species. [But] is there a trade-off? What are the other compensatory changes that have occurred to ensure a perfectly functioning perfectly normal gut ""¶ [and] a fine, healthy individual?""ù

science,UCSB Selected to Host New Quantum Foundry,3-Oct-19,2:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/ucsb-selected-to-host-new-quantum-foundry/,"With the future of electronics potentially heading toward quantum technology, UCSB secures its place at the forefront of this emerging field with its new Quantum Foundry.†† The National Science Foundation (NSF) has granted UCSB $25 million over six years to advance the ""discovery and control of materials that support protected quantum states with unprecedented coherence and scalable entanglement,""ù the Quantum Foundry's website states. The center will be located in Elings Hall within the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI). With classical technology seemingly having reached many of its limits, researchers are increasingly exploring quantum computing. ""What's next for electronics is maybe you can make computers for certain applications that can be more powerful by switching the mode of computation from classical computation to quantum computation. There's games that can be had if you can build quantum computers,""ù Stephen Wilson, co-director of the Quantum Foundry and an associate professor in the Materials Department, said. But pursuing this ""new frontier""ù will provide challenges as progress is still at a ""basic research level""ù with no general consensus on what types of materials or designs and architecture are recommended to utilize and manipulate quantum information, according to Wilson. Through three research thrusts, the Foundry will attempt to address these limitations ""î namely to suppress decoherence, in which once quantum states of materials interact with the environment, quantum phenomena is decohered and will appear to behave classically. The first research thrust proposes to characterize materials with ""highly entangled many-body states and protected coherence,""ù according to the website. The second thrust aims to create and control protected quantum states in hybrid materials so that quantum information can be generated within the materials and have native decoherence protection from the environment. The third thrust will engineer material platforms that host localized quantum states with robust coherence to ""basically encode quantum information that is protected from decohering natively""¶called a natively entangled state,""ù Wilson detailed. Efforts to realize these goals will involve researchers from multiple departments and disciplinaries, fostering a collaborative environment. ""Suppressing decoherence is a challenge, and a challenge that involves a lot of materials work, a lot of physics, a lot of chemistry ""î sort of a very multi-pronged effort to be able to battle decoherence and actually realize quantum phenomena in useful ways,""ù Ania Bleszynski Jayich, co-director of the Foundry and an associate professor in the Department of Physics, said.† Added Wilson, ""That ends up being a very interdisciplinary thing, trying to weave together engineering aspects, the quantum information science and obviously the core physics of quantum information science, but also having other fields where you have different perspectives like chemistry involved. And also getting electrical engineering and materials industry [involved].""ù The Foundry's work will include a significant data science component as well. ""We're getting data science students involved with the quantum researchers and quantum mechanics, just sort of understanding how does one take data and curate data in such a way to make it accessible to data scientists and vice versa,""ù Bleszynski Jayich said. The Quantum Foundry, dedicated to engineering and characterizing materials with protected quantum coherence and entanglement, will be located in Elings Hall within the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI). / Courtesy of the CNSI The NSF grant will be largely used for equipment and infrastructure to synthesize and characterize these mostly not-yet-existing materials that exhibit quantum phenomena. The equipment will be ""all multi-user""¶very much in the spirit of how UCSB does things,""ù Bleszynski Jayich said. One pillar of the Foundry is to have industry partnerships to ""interact and intertwine industry and academic research in the space,""ù according to Wilson. With a deep technology connection in terms of industry funding and encouraging entrepreneurship on campus and in Santa Barbara, UCSB boasts strong industry partnerships that made it an ideal candidate to host the Quantum Foundry. 10 industry partners that have signed on will utilize the center to explore applications in the quantum information field. ""Because these are really state-of-the-art equipment that can benefit a lot of people,""ù Bleszynski Jayich said. The Foundry intends to ""facilitate this broader national network [and try] to lead a coalition of partners,""ù Wilson described. This includes research partners at other universities, in national labs, in industry and partners like other federal agencies to ""collectively push forward""ù in this field. Education will also be a large focus of the Foundry. The NSF funding will support workshops that can bring industry and academic partners together and a visiting lecture series granting a broad quantum education, according to Bleszynski Jayich. This is in addition to new graduate courses that will be offered year-round in various departments, including physics, materials and chemistry. These classes will focus on quantum science and mechanics, but also specifically provide a practical quantum education. The Foundry plans to have lab classes with curriculum focused beyond the theory of quantum mechanics, to investigate its realized implementations and tackle preventing decoherence.† ""In practice, how does one actually design and build and control quantum systems in order to be able to use them and maintain their quantum property? So that's a challenge that's really cutting-edge research, but that is to the point where we can now start beginning to introduce that in lab classes,""ù Bleszynski Jayich said. She expects undergraduate students will take advantage of these courses as well. ""There are a lot of undergraduates out there hungry for quantum education because they really are excited by the new phenomena and the very fascinating phenomena that they learned in quantum mechanics. And they also see that there's really a market for that, too.""ù Having numerous industry and academic partners signed onto the Foundry will offer plenty of opportunities for trained students to contribute and make progress in this growing field. These may involve industry internships and externships, as well as ""ample opportunities for undergraduates to get involved in research. Which, there's a huge appetite for already,""ù Bleszynski Jayich said. In retrospect, Bleszynski Jayich says UCSB was ""an obvious choice""ù to be selected to host the Quantum Foundry with its reputable physics department ""î the largest in the nation with over 700 undergraduates ""î in addition to its strong materials, electrical engineering and computer engineering departments. ""Not only are we strong in those areas, but we work together already. And people know that very well. UCSB is known for its collaborative nature. And that's sort of necessary to address these very difficult problems that have to be solved in order to bring sort of quantum technologies to fruition,""ù she stated. Wilson agreed, stating, ""[S]panning from electronic state prediction to electronic state discovery to new material synthesis, UCSB is sort of the leader in this space""¶and we have a lot of activity, and we have a lot of strength""¶ [in] basically translating new ideas into eventual applications.† And so we are sort of a natural place to try and lead the effort.""ù As co-directors, Bleszynski Jayich and Wilson will manage the Foundry, ensuring that the numerous research, education, industry and networking aspects run smoothly in an interconnected way. ""We're excited about getting started. I think it'll be fun. It'll be a really exciting effort on campus,""ù Wilson said. Bleszynski Jayich emphasized that they've gotten to where they are with much support from ""really good role models""ù on campus, who have contributed significantly. Additionally, she stated that the process to establish the Foundry at UCSB has showed her how ""supportive""ù the community is and what ""fantastic scientists""ù are on campus. ""It's pretty amazing to see that in action at UCSB. And that whole process has made me proud to be at UCSB for that reason, and makes me want to continue that tradition.

science,Potential Positive Impacts of Seaweed on Climate Change,10-Oct-19,9:00 AM,['Hannah Hirou'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/potential-positive-impacts-of-seaweed-on-climate-change/,"A recent study from UCSB researchers examined the potential impacts of seaweed aquaculture on carbon offsetting. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has cautioned the world that it is crucial to limit global warming to 1.5∫C and not reach 2∫C above pre-industrial levels to prevent greater ""robust global differences in temperature means and extremes.""ù This requires rapid and intense global reductions in both carbon dioxide and non-carbon dioxide climate pollutants. Many governments have addressed climate change, and reports and policies such as the Fourth National Climate Assessment, California Climate Action Plan and Paris Climate Agreement stress the urgency to react to climate change. It is perhaps a silver lining that when it comes to environmental markets, carbon markets are now the most expensive markets in the world. New research by UC Santa Barbara researchers Halley Froehlich, Jamie Afflerbach, Melanie Frazier and Benjamin Halpern, titled ""Blue Growth Potential to Mitigate Climate Change through Seaweed Offsetting""ù and published in Current Biology addresses the impact that seaweed farming could have on carbon offsetting, as well as other ecological benefits. Carbon offsetting is compensating for emissions of another industry or human activity with a process that reduces carbon emissions to a net zero. Seaweed naturally plays a role in the sequestering of carbon by storing carbon in their tissues that is then exported to the deeper ocean via what the study calls a ""biological pump.""ù The carbon is deposited on the seafloor, in the depths of the ocean and out of the atmosphere. Currently seaweed is farmed, but on a scale that would only account for 1% of carbon sequestration if it were deposited in the deep ocean. Seaweed is currently grown for use in food, medicine, biotechnology and cosmetics. At the current scale of farming it is a carbon negative operation, meaning that it could also offset many other forms of popular aquaculture. ""We found seaweed aquaculture could offset all of finfish and aquaculture (even with accounting for seaweed farming emissions) with sinking just 14-25% of current standing farmed production in the deep ocean,""ù Frazier explained in an email. It is a viable solution on a regional scale, especially in areas with favorable climates such as California, but lacks the ability to make an impact on a global scale. To be able to acquit the world of its carbon emissions produced by agriculture ""î around 5.1 billion tons per year ""î seaweed farming would have to increase from the current 1.9 thousand km≤ to 7.3 million km≤, which represents 15% of the ocean that is potentially habitable for seaweed aquaculture, according to the study. ""We found it is unlikely seaweed aquaculture alone could scale to address global agricultural emissions,""ù Frazier detailed. That's not to say that efforts such as this done globally would not add up. The study goes as far as to assert that it could be beneficial to progressive countries or ones with bold economies tailored to circumvent carbon emission whilst supporting Blue Growth Initiatives, which is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' (FAO) framework for sustainably developing fisheries and aquaculture. A look at the economic viability of seaweed farming indicates some obstacles. One being that if farmed seaweed was harvested solely for human use it would greatly reduce its potential to offset carbon emissions. A portion of the seaweed grown would need to be deposited out at sea, but what economic incentives would there be to persuade farmers to do this extra work and lose a portion of their income? According to Frazier, ""That is a huge hurdle, which we highlight in the paper. Policy changes and integration into the voluntary carbon market are key, alongside reduction in farming costs. Economies of scale would help, but it is not a simple ask.""ù The implementation of effective policy remains complicated, and while this is the case, aquaculture growth remains speculative. Halpern addresses over email, ""In California, policy (rules and regulations) make rapid growth of aquaculture unlikely, so there is not likely a fast way to do this.""ù Different marine environments were canvassed via data sets to locate areas where seaweed aquaculture showed the most benefits and viability. California proved to have an ideal climate for seaweed aquaculture as well as thriving populations of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. Seaweed aquaculture appears to be a clever choice for carbon offsetting, but its benefits do not end there. As Frazier puts it, ""Seaweed aquaculture also has ""òcharismatic carbon' potential. That is, it can serve multiple purposes, not just carbon capture, including local buffering of acidic ocean conditions and improving water quality.""ù Even if the goals of carbon offsetting are not fully realized, seaweed farming has also showed promising signs for carbon offsetting as well as other environmental benefits such as restoring eutrophic, hypoxic or acidic waters to their natural equilibrium. Halpern details the process, ""Seaweed pulls nitrogen from the water to grow (like being fertilized, but nitrogen is naturally in the water). Eutrophication is excess nitrogen in the water, so seaweed draws that excess nitrogen out of the water.""ù Hopefully in years to come, aquaculture will emerge as a viable industry with many ecological benefits.

science,New Research Sheds Light on Prehistoric Migrations of South and Central Asia,10-Oct-19,2:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/new-research-sheds-light-on-prehistoric-migrations-of-south-and-central-asia/,"A newly appointed professor in the Department of Anthropology at UC Santa Barbara, Douglas Kennett, working alongside a multitude of other researchers across many institutions and disciplines, has helped to paint a clearer picture of the human story of ancient migration to South and Central Asia, and the spread of language and practices which coincided with this. The paper, ""The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia,""ù published in the journal Science, brought together the remains of over 500 ancient humans from Central Asia and Southern Asia. The researchers extracted and sequenced DNA from their remains and compared them genomically with previously sequenced ancient DNA as well as baseline data from contemporary populations in Eurasia. ""The foundation is archaeological, all of the human skeletal material sampled and analyzed from archaeological sites throughout South Asia and Central Asia ""¶ to look at sort of the population history of people in the area over the last 8,000 years,""ù Kennett said. His lab at Penn State University, where he worked for much of the study, performed radiocarbon dating on individual remains so as to map out the data in the chronological sense. ""It was really an impressive increase in the number of information that we have about populations and particularly in South Asia and Central Asia, which was an area that had not been really focused on too much,""ù Kennett detailed. ""There are definitely periods of time that are better represented than others. But given the size of the dataset, we were able to cover the bases pretty well.""ù With this new information came a number of revelations regarding the origin and linguistic spread of Central and Southern Asian people and Indo-European languages in general, lending even more credibility to the steppe theory, which posits that people from the Eurasian region were those who spread the Indo-European language family west into Europe and east into Asia. This runs in contrast to its prominent counterpart, the Anatolian hypothesis, which claims instead that farmers from what would presently be called Turkey spread Indo-European language both west and east, crossing Europe and simultaneously digging deeper into Southern Asia. ""This research pretty much puts it to rest, the debate which has been going on for 200 years,""ù Kennett said. ""The Eurasian steppe is where pastoralism developed ""¶ independent of what happens in the Near East. Those populations were very successful and then spread out and they were the ones that actually were carrying the European languages. There's some data from Europe that was published previously that suggests that that was the case. And then this study reinforces that idea.""ù More specifically, the research found different periods of migration and the spread of practices which affected the region in different ways. About 8,000 years ago, there was an early spread of farmers who developed an agricultural economy which spread into Europe and Central Asia, but not South Asia, according to Kennett. ""Then later on, starting about 4,000 years ago you have a development of a sort of pastoral economy that's very animal-focused and that's in that steppe region. So with the European languages, that's the linkage of South Asia which is consistent with the idea that ties the European languages to this later spread of pastoral peoples,""ù Kennett said. The authors' depiction of the spread of Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry from a focal point found north of the Black Sea into Europe and South Asia during the Bronze Age is shown. Pie charts represent the proportion of Yamnaya ancestry. / Courtesy of Douglas Kennett Among Kennett's primary collaborators was David Reich, whose lab at Harvard University was tasked with extracting DNA from the skeletal material of individuals. ""He's done large scale studies all over the world. I've been working with him for the last three years or so helping him with the chronological dimensions,""ù Kennett stated. While mapping the spread of people chronologically through radiocarbon dating, Kennett and his research group also simultaneously looked for certain properties which served as markers of diet, which could provide indications regarding what sort of lifestyle was being practiced by the individual. Pastoral economies, agricultural economies and hunter-gatherer economies all would have slightly different markers, for instance. ""There's that old adage that ""òyou are what you eat.' If people are eating a lot of specific foods, if they're eating a lot of meat, that will show up in their nitrogen isotopes. They look distinctive isotopically. Then we can compare the date of the individual, the DNA, like where they are, what their ancestry is and then also look at the diet,""ù Kennett described. Kennett plans to continue working with these isotopic analyses in a subsequent study in order to better understand the diets of ancient people with regards to agriculture, pastoralism and other comparative lifestyles. ""I'm an environmental archaeologist. One of the things that I'm interested in more generally is the environmental impacts that agricultural and pastoral populations had on the landscape which we can then explore with isotopic analyses or other kinds of archaeological and ecological studies,""ù Kennett said. Speaking on the paper published in Science, Kennett believes that the most illuminating ramifications are the ""big picture""ù ones, which speak to how agricultural and pastoral populations emerge and expand, ""and then what that means ultimately for the formation of later, more complex societies.""ù ""That's kind of the global story as humans, anyways.""ù

science,UCSB Professor Awarded Funding To Evaluate and Rank Climate Models,17-Oct-19,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/90453/,"With a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Ding will evaluate climate models of Arctic sea ice to better determine how to optimize their efficiency. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons A professor in UC Santa Barbara's Earth Research Institute, Qinghua Ding, has received a $200,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Climate Program Office in the Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections Program for his proposal to evaluate climate models and understand what makes some more accurate than others and why.† With the newfound funding, Ding intends to judge climate models along a newly established rubric, ranking their methodologies and providing input with regard to how models can better reflect reality and improve the accuracy of their predictions. ""We'll start from observation. We have a benchmark. Do we know this from observation? Because we only have 40 years [of] data to work with. Based on this, we decide on metrics then we use these metrics to put on the model and apply to the model something akin to a correlation,""ù Ding, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, said.† With a focus on Arctic sea ice, Ding will cross-reference many different models in order to better understand how to optimize their effectiveness and which models at present are the most efficacious in predicting conditions. ""The main goal is to say which model will do the best job for Arctic sea ice simulation. We've tried to design some metrics and we'll use these metrics, apply the same metrics to a model and then we'll cast ranking based on these criteria,""ù Ding explained. Climate models must take into account not only the breadth of variables affecting conditions but also the degree to which a variable is responsible for altering the state of things. There are many different attributes to take into account. Determining the strength of the relationship between a given driver of melting and the corresponding response is key. According to Ding, many models fail because, although they include all of the measurable impacts, they do not properly gauge the significance of variables relative to one another.† ""There are many challenges which arise in building long-term climate models, especially with regards to sensitivity,""ù Ding said.†† Accuracy becomes more challenging as more variables are put in. Putting in more components to the model is necessary to best reflect reality but concurrently as more components are introduced, forecasting an outcome is difficult due to the uncertainty. ""The climate model includes a lot of chaotic features. It's active internal variability, generated by the model itself to take into account natural variability, because so many components can determine the outcomes,""ù Ding stated. Sea ice, for example, can be influenced by a variety of different factors. Sea ice touching land will melt more due to conduction, the thickness of the sea ice will influence the rate of melting, and strong winds can blow sea ice into the North Atlantic and in turn increase the rapidity of melting. Due to this, measuring net impact can be very difficult. ""So many factors can influence and have some impact on sea ice""¶and the modeler, the model developing group, they have no idea which is more important,""ù Ding said. ""It's a really complex model. It's a pretty well-developed code. The problem is that most people have no idea how to make the model behave in a balanced way. We don't know which way is the right way,""ù he continued.† With such a large amount of things to model and different variables to take into account, sensitivity is key and also, unfortunately, the measure which is perhaps the most difficult to perfect. Ding and his research group will collaborate with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University. They will also collaborate with NASA and employ their exhaustive datasets.† Ding plans to complete the assessments within the next two to three years. Two undergraduate students will work alongside him. ""I hope after the project we can give some suggestions for the model developer about how to improve their model further. We don't want to just see a model as ""òbad' or ""òworse' or as ""ògood.' We want to tell people how to improve their model and correct imperfections.""ù

By tracking the quantity or quality of light over time as it moves around in a cell, scientists can decipher much about the cell's inner workings without having to use invasive techniques. For nearly 25 years, genetically encoded light-emitting reporters have served as a staple technology to help researchers understand many different cellular and molecular processes with ""absolute genetically defined precision,""ù according to Mukherjee. However, these conventional reporter proteins aren't without their constraints. Namely, they can't emit light in and therefore cannot be used to study oxygen-deficient, or anaerobic, environments. ""There's a lot of fascinating biology that happens in the complete absence of oxygen,""ù Mukherjee said. For instance, he mentions the anaerobic activity occurring deep under the ocean floor as well as the microbes in your gut aiding in digestion.†† Mukherjee's research lab is working to overcome these challenges by developing bioluminescent reporters inspired by the legacy of standard reporters, but ones that are able to produce light in the context of anaerobic conditions. The goal is to be able to visualize oxygen-independent systems that Mukherjee terms the ""dark matter of biology.""ù ""If you're interested in studying these systems, either for medical reasons [such as] to understand how the core of a tumor responds to different therapies or to collect different microbes and enable them or engineer them for bioproduction, then we need technologies that can help us visualize biology in these contexts,""ù he explained. ""There is only so much you can learn by looking at cells on a culture dish or in a tube. Beyond a point you have to go inside a living organism.""ù For these purposes, more penetrant technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used to image through layers of living tissue. While reporters compatible with light have been established for the past three decades, creating reporters compatible with MRI ""requires a slightly new way of thinking or a slight paradigm shift,""ù Mukherjee said. Mukherjee's work focuses on developing fluorescent reporter proteins that can work in anaerobic systems, or what he calls the ""dark matter of biology,""ù such as the gut. The NIH has awarded Mukherjee a grant that will aid his lab's research efforts. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons To assist Mukherjee in pursuing his research, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has awarded him with its Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA). Funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the $1.8 million grant for five years aims to enhance ""scientific productivity and the chances for important breakthroughs""ù to ""the nation's highly talented and promising investigators,""ù its website details. Unlike various other agency grants, MIRA recognizes an entire program rather than a specific project, supporting the whole vision of Mukherjee's lab. ""That's amazing, because it lets me do two things. One is it lets me minimize grant writing for a certain fraction of time, because this really is very generous support from the NIH that helps us completely focus attention on these two areas ""¶ It directly means that I can spend more time coordinating research projects, working on and writing papers and [carrying out] all the ideas that are laid out from their logical layout to their initial conclusions.""ù The award's other impact is that it helps ""validate""ù Mukherjee's research efforts. ""Of course, I'm excited by these ideas, and I know a lot of other colleagues and I know other faculty who are excited by these ideas. So to have really respectable senior peers in the field say that this is something that is fundable, I think is encouraging validation for somebody who's relatively new to this job,""ù Mukherjee, who joined UCSB's faculty in 2017, said. One anaerobic system he especially wants to explore is the gut microbiome. ""It's an extremely complex and interesting ecosystem; there's so many different things that goes on there,""ù he stated. He points out that ""recent evidence indicates what happens in the gut doesn't just stop in your gut; it influences how you think, it influences how you behave socially, it influences how you respond to different treatments, how you react to different diseases, all these things.""ù From an imaging standpoint, he is interested in the gut because it is anaerobic and physically located deep inside animals. ""If you really want to understand gut biology, you need imaging technologies that bridge both these scales: the cellular scale as well as the organismal scale.""ù Mukherjee's group intends to be able to employ molecular bioimaging to study microbes and microbial communities in the gut, including how they communicate, how they break down different food compounds and how they regulate different genetic or signaling pathways. While these experiments would mainly be cell culture-based, the researchers aim to complement them with studies to detect various chemicals or map the biogeography of the gut in the context of a living animal. ""I think we'll be able to see our divergent goals converging and focusing on really deciphering the complexities of the gut biology,""ù Mukherjee said. Another potential area of interest that could utilize Mukherjee's engineered reporter proteins is neuroscience. With much context-dependent information such as in neurogenesis, neuroexcitation and neurodegenerative diseases, these processes and cellular and neural functions would benefit from being studied in the context of a living animal, he described. Working with the ""excellent""ù neuroscience faculty on campus in which they provide the questions, Mukherjee's team then focuses on developing these technologies that can supplement culture-based neurobiological studies with living animal studies, all in an effort to ""increase the depth and breadth of information that you get from these imaging instruments.""ù Mukherjee summarized, ""Those are the two main areas where we think and hope we will be making an impact on in the coming years.""ù

science,Turning the Tide: Researchers Conduct Study of Climate Change Effects on Mexican Fisheries,24-Oct-19,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/turning-the-tide-researchers-conduct-study-of-climate-change-effects-on-mexican-fisheries/,"After taking a global perspective on how climate change-driven impacts may impact fisheries, UCSB researchers are now studying impacts on a more regional scale and turning their focus toward Mexican fisheries. / Courtesy of Carlos Aguilera and Environmental Defense Fund Fisheries globally can expect to be affected by climate change. However, due to the prevalence of data-poor fisheries worldwide, exactly how fisheries can expect to be affected is a difficult question to answer. There may be a solution to this. Researchers at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management have collaborated with the nonprofit environmental group Environmental Defense Fund and Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Pesca y Acuacultura to devise a method to evaluate climate change-driven impacts on fisheries with limited data, as well as appropriate ways to respond to anticipated changes. ""Basically, we developed this framework where we'd be able to say something for fisheries in data-poor contexts,""ù Tracey Mangin, a researcher with the Bren School and co-author of the paper, said. Mangin had previously been involved in a research project which examined the effect of climate change on fisheries from the global perspective, looking at three metrics ""î namely ""biomass, or fish in the water, harvest, or the amount that [fishermen] extract and profit, or how much money the fishermen are making.""ù However, the breadth of a global study was an obstacle to more in-depth analysis, and Mangin and her collaborators decided that examination from a more regional perspective would help the team make more qualitative assessments. In particular, the new study published in PLOS One hopes to look at a greater scope of climate effects than a global study would allow. In the global study, the projections only took into account climate velocity ""î the speed and trajectory with which species must move to maintain their desired climate conditions. ""But there are other things which affect a fisheries productivity and range, like ocean acidification,""ù Mangin noted. The team chose to zoom in on Mexican fisheries. ""We thought that Mexico would be a great case study. They are growing in terms of the exportation markets and they are also pretty susceptible to climate change.""ù Mexico is representative of global fisheries in other ways as well, being a country with a varied coastline and diverse species in terms of life history and spatial range, as well as hosting both very high-value and low-value species. Courtesy of Carlos Aguilera and Environmental Defense Fund The researchers created their own database. Compiling expert opinions and literature regarding the condition of fisheries in Mexico along with projections for climate change up to the year 2040, the team assessed how the condition of individual fish stocks would change given a variety of warming scenarios. Included in this parameterization were characteristics such as temperature, ocean acidification and changes in precipitation. ""In a qualitative way, we assessed the productivity of the fish stock, how many fish are produced and then two, where the fish will be, so the spatial range of those fish, which really affects who can catch the fish,""ù Mangin said. ""We were not surprised that, for the most part, we saw negative effects, mostly because that is consistent with a lot of literature out there with regards to tropical and subtropical systems and fisheries,""ù Mangin continued. However, the researchers were surprised to find the impact of improved management of fish stocks in maintaining profits and harvests while controlling damage to fisheries in the future. Many stocks in Mexico are being overexploited or are overexploited already, meaning that fisheries ""can't produce the maximum amount possible because their population is so depleted, or the pressure is so hard currently that a decline is inevitable,""ù according to Mangin. Fisheries who choose to respond to these anticipated changes by improving their management style will reap big benefits in the long term. ""At the end of the day, if we can expect that productivity is generally going to decline in fisheries, we argue that the best thing to do is to actually fix management now, because basically if the changes don't occur, you're still in a better place than you would be, and if you continue with poor management, your stocks will be depleted regardless,""ù Mangin explained. According to Mangin, the most effective management styles are also the ones which can be broadly applied to many different contexts. For example, adaptive fisheries management tools which limit catches in response to the biomass of the water are ""basically resilient to climate change,""ù while transboundary fishing agreements are very well-suited to stocks which undergo spatial shifts in response to climate velocity. Mangin is optimistic about the implications of this research. ""When thinking about how we can use our resources efficiently ""¶ we can develop frameworks that are similar to the ones presented, where even if we don't have the best data, we can start to prioritize certain stocks and certain regions and then fix the underlying current problems.""ù

science,How to Improve Running Efficiency,24-Oct-19,2:30 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/how-to-improve-running-efficiency/,"The next time you're dashing across campus by foot 10 minutes late on your way to your 8 a.m., consider attaching a simple elastic band connecting your legs to improve your running economy. According to recent research from UCSB mechanical engineering assistant professor Elliot Hawkes, adding a spring linking your feet can help you run more efficiently, reducing the energy needed by about 6.4%. Running is the most energy-costly mode of locomotion for humans, according to Hawkes' study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology. Less than one of every 10 calories spent is needed to maintain a constant forward velocity ""î essentially ""wasting""ù the remaining energy. ""Running is inefficient because every step, you slow your body down as your foot hits the ground, then speed it back up as you push off. This consumes most of the energy. Also, every step, you have to slow your swinging leg down at the extents of the stride, then speed it back up. This consumes a measurable, but much smaller amount of energy,""ù Hawkes, who conducted the research while at Stanford University, wrote in an email. While numerous devices have been designed to help increase efficacy for this rather inefficient human activity, Hawkes and his research group took a less-studied approach. Rather than focus on the primary motion of running when the foot hits the ground, they looked at improving efficiency through the leg swing ""î the smaller, secondary part of the action. The concept is seen in nature, in which some animals have spring-like tissues or an ""exotendon""ù believed to assist in leg swing. The scientists realized that adding a light resistance band connecting a runner's legs would produce this effect and ""recycle the energy,""ù according to Hawkes. They tested this out by measuring energy consumption as runners used the device. Above is a time-lapse photo showing one complete gait cycle of a runner using UCSB researcher Elliot Hawkes and Stanford researchers' elastic ""exotendon""ù to reduce energy costs during running. / Courtesy of Journal of Environmental Biology The band works by applying assistive forces to offload the muscles that normally swing the legs, taking the brunt of the work needed to run. ""Then, with the stored energy in the spring, it helps speed [your legs] back up as they come together, again saving you energy,""ù Hawkes explained. By slowing down the runner's legs at the extents of the swing, the spring boosts the ""energy optimal stride frequency,""ù according to the paper. This causes runners to take shorter and faster strides as they adopt this frequency. Shorter strides decreases biological joint moments and power, reducing the energy costs needed to redirect the runner's center of mass when their feet hit the ground (during stance) while running. Hawkes, who personally tried out the ""exotendon,""ù expressed that it ""feels great. It makes you feel fast and your legs feel light!""ù The investigators initially attached the spring around a runner's knees. However, they found that it was more comfortable and did not rub against the skin when the band was clipped onto the shoes. Additionally, having the device on a lower location on the body provides less exertion needed to produce the assistive forces to the legs. It also allows for more natural running movements. The band they used was made from natural latex rubber surgical tubing. Set to 25% of the runner's leg length, the researchers described this to be ""long enough to avoid breaking and short enough to avoid tripping during running""ù in their study. So far, Hawkes and his Stanford collaborators have experimented with the band during relatively slow speeds (10 min/mile) and on relatively flat surfaces. The ""exotendon""ù has worked well under these conditions, including on city streets, without any reported tripping incidents. But it probably won't work for trail running, Hawkes stated. He expressed interest in testing the band's effects at higher running speeds. In addition to improving running economy, the spring shortens your stride, ""which some people claim may help with injury prevention,""ù Hawkes said. However, he noted the research group has not looked into this concept. In finding that the associated energy savings with using this low-cost, low-tech device can be ""much larger than would be expected from savings directly associated with a low-expenditure component of gait,""ù Hawkes said that ""sometimes very simple ideas can work well!""ù

science,Exploring the Cognitive Science of Supernatural Concepts,31-Oct-19,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/exploring-the-cognitive-science-of-supernatural-concepts/,"Ghosts, destiny, astrology, an afterlife. Whether you believe in any of these concepts or not, it's undeniable that ideas about the supernatural have fascinated humans for centuries. Tamsin German, a UCSB professor of psychological & brain sciences, developed and teaches PSY 145, Cognitive Science of Supernatural Concepts. Combining multiple disciplines including anthropology, philosophy and history, the class explores the research and theory behind why beliefs of supernatural concepts have pervaded across numerous cultures and why our brains are susceptible to such notions. ""The definition [of supernatural] that we use in the class is concepts or entities or systems of thinking that there's evidence that people believe in them across cultures, but they're not things that there is consensus scientific evidence for. They exist outside of our natural scientific understanding,""ù German said. ""And the way we approach it in class is not to make any particular assumption going in about whether those beliefs or concepts are true or false, but just recognize that they're widely believed across cultures.""ù Alex Garcia / DAILY NEXUS In the course, German covers why supernatural concepts are so widespread, found within specific cultures and across cultures and history. This includes looking at how features of culture work to allow these beliefs to be transmitted from generation to generation and from person to person. Another large focus is to identify features of how human minds work to enable these beliefs to flourish. ""We look at how people see the world as containing patterns and extract meaning from noise, and how, because of the limits on the information that you have, you can sometimes detect patterns that may not be there. Or on closer inspection or with longer to consult, you might come to a different conclusion,""ù German said. Much research in psychology has studied how readily humans find patterns in their lives: seeing faces in clouds or seeing events as connected when they're highly unlikely to have occurred in the same place at the same time. A general feature of our psychology is to infer meaning from those connections even though they may be coincidental, according to German. From an evolutionary perspective, this propensity may benefit us. ""We're designed to be very good at inferring meaning because that will make us more successful as individuals and within groups, when we can figure out what causes what, when is this stuff there versus not,""ù German described. This may also have been a key aspect to humanity's survival since the prehistoric period. For instance, humans can readily discern inanimate objects from things that move on their own. We're extremely aware of movement in our environment because of how important it is not to miss them. ""What if it's a snake, what if it's a predator? It's much better to think it's a snake when it's really a twig than think it's a twig when it's really a snake,""ù German said. This may also explain why we're more likely to find a face in the clouds instead of a toaster. So if supernatural beliefs are extremely prevalent, there must be explanations for why, on a large scale, ""humans are just supposed to do that.""ù In her class, German looks at the general reasons for why as a species, people believe in supernatural concepts and how that may give rise to individual differences. ""People's intuitions about how likely they are to infer meaning from a particular stimulus has been shown to differ. People can be more likely to see meaning when they're feeling in less control over their lives than when they're more in control,""ù she said. As for what can cause people to be more or less willing to subscribe to such beliefs is a complicated issue with many factors to consider. One such way that people can arrive at skepticism is through exposure to a science education, German detailed. ""It turns out that scientific concepts are very unintuitive concepts; they're very hard to grasp. And so, it's been shown that it's sort of an effortful process to be skeptical about beliefs when our intuitions drive us toward them.""ù This may help explain the apparent discrepancy in which many people describe themselves as skeptical but still feel compelled to explain certain events that happen in their lives through fate or destiny. ""Even though they don't quite understand or couldn't argue that there was good evidence that someone was arranging things that way,""ù German said. German states that it's not unusual or problematic to simultaneously believe inconsistent things as humans. One example she brings up in her course is visual illusions, such as a set of two lines. Although one line appears longer than the other, they measure at the same length. ""And knowing that it's an illusion doesn't make [the effect] go away, right? You can both see the lines as different lengths and know that they're the same lengths. Nobody is embarrassed by that. Nobody's worried like, ""òOh, it's inconsistent. What am I supposed to do? I'm a victim of this visual illusion.'""ù The same applies to our thoughts, with ""thinking illusions""ù that compel us to ""see meaning in a very unusual, unlikely coincidence,""ù according to German. ""When enough events happen, sometimes events that you don't think are very likely will happen. We just really want to explain it. And it's sometimes not satisfying to take what is actually a very realistic answer.""ù Consider winners of the California lottery who have hit the jackpot twice. It seems like a strange coincidence, but upon taking a closer look at the number of people who play, it would be stranger if that hadn't happened, German said. ""But we're not good at knowing when we're in the presence of randomness. And so we tend to see lots of meaning.""ù In PSY 145, Cognitive Science of Supernatural Concepts, UCSB professor Tamsin German delves into why supernatural concepts such as astrology and spirits are so prevalent across cultures and throughout history. The course also examines what features of our thinking may facilitate our belief in supernatural concepts. / Aly Witmer/DAILY NEXUS , Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Of course, which supernatural concepts people believe in vary greatly. These ideas largely depend on culture and belief systems that are dominant during one's upbringing. This tracks for why there are many more followers of Islam, Christianity and Buddhism than there are of Zeus and other ancient Greek figures, German said. Additionally, our reliance on other individuals for much of our acquired knowledge leads us to trust people who are knowledgeable of the local environment, such as our parents or siblings. German appreciates the ""value""ù of some such beliefs. ""It's easier to understand that the world around us exists for a reason than to contemplate the idea that it's the accumulation of random processes or animals have the features they do because of natural selection.""ù For example, take the belief in an afterlife. The concept appears as different forms in different cultures, whether it be a particular place that your soul/spirit/personality goes to or reincarnation into a different body or that something continues even after your body is defunct. ""There is plenty of scientific evidence that minds don't continue to work after the death of the body,""ù German said. ""But that can sort of confront us with a rather disturbing situation where [that can be] quite terrifying, right, contemplating one's own annihilation. And so a belief that, in fact, things don't end and that we could go on to another place and our existence isn't over could be very compelling for that reason.""ù Instances of supernatural concepts have spread throughout popular culture, including on Halloween. Oct. 31 showcases and even celebrates some supernatural aspects such as ghosts and various monsters. ""I think people are fascinated by Halloween because of a connection to the supernatural,""ù German said. As it's not a holiday premised around a very specific set of beliefs, Halloween allows for wider participation. ""It's a celebration of all of those things that we can't explain,""ù German said. ""And science has explained a lot, but there's still plenty that it hasn't, so there's room. There's room for the paranormal; there's room for the supernatural to exist. Halloween just brings our attention on it, and I'll always think it's my favorite holiday for that reason.""ù (And, German added, she likes the costumes and candy.) German stated, ""I love teaching this class more than anything else I've done ""¶ I find it really fun to delve into it. So I'm always motivated to find out the newest thinking on a particular [related] topic.""ù

science,Convergent Evolution in Deep-Sea Fish,5-Nov-19,1:37 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-05/convergent-evolution-in-deep-sea-fish/,"On Monday, Oct. 28, Todd Oakley's lab invited Matt Davis to speak on his research into the evolution of ray-finned fishes in the deep sea. The seminar, ""Evolution in the Dark: Habitat Transitions and Adaptations in Deep-Sea Fishes,""ù held in the UCSB Marine Science Institute Auditorium, focused on the interspecies variation found in ray-finned fishes within the pelagic zone.† Matt Davis spoke about convergent traits of ray-finned fishes, including enlarged dentition and the evolution of fangs. / Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus Davis, an associate professor of biology at St. Cloud State University, began with an overview of the varietal taxa of ray-finned fishes found in the deep sea before delving more specifically into the traits which characterize them. He made note of the degree of convergent traits observed in deep-sea fishes, namely enlarged dentition and bioluminescence, which have evolved independently in several different lineages.† Specifically with regards to bioluminescence, Davis spoke on the independent mutations of bioluminescence across the ray-finned fishes that were studied, reflecting on the variety of anatomical structures and mechanisms associated with the common function. A thorough examination of the ray-finned fish tree of life revealed the independent evolution of bioluminescence occurring over 27 different times, a higher number than initially thought.† Bioluminescence mechanisms in deep-sea fish can be classified according to how bioluminescence is achieved. Some species develop symbiotic relationships with bacteria, evolving different structures and pouches associated with the storage of these bacteria, while others exhibit intrinsic bioluminescence, in which emission of light is achieved without the symbiosis of bacteria.† ""The mechanisms for why bacteria are stored and say their lure or how they're getting nutrients or things is less well known. There's still a lot of work to be done on some of these particular systems,""ù Davis said.† Davis and other researchers were interested in the varying uses which ray-finned fishes had for mechanisms of bioluminescence, including communication, predator avoidance, prey attraction and counterillumination, a function common in pelagic lineages.† Lanternfish in particular were useful study subjects, inhabiting an area of the ocean with no physical barriers to gene flow alongside another lineage of bioluminescent fish. ""They're one of the more abundant [fishes] in terms of biomass. But in terms of species diversity, they're actually quite depauperate, and the general trend here ""¶ is that when we look at fishes that use bioluminescence for communication, we find repeatedly that those lineages have elevated rates of speciation,""ù Davis described.† In contrast, bioluminescent fish using the ability predominantly for camouflage and other non-communicative functions did not show elevated rates of species diversification. Another point of discussion was the histological work done to better understand the tissues associated with bioluminescence. Ongoing research is honing in on the ""more unknown bioluminescent systems""ù across fish, such as deep-sea swallowers, according to Davis.† There have been ""some cases ""¶ where we found that the bioluminescent tissues are derived from liver; sometimes they're derived from epidermal tissues. We're trying to get a better sense of the anatomy associated with some of these bioluminescent structures that have been somewhat understudied,""ù he said.† Davis also delved into the widespread incidence of enlarged dentition in ray-finned fishes that invade the deep sea.† Enlarged dentition was a trait observed in broad swaths of taxa and appeared much more frequently in deep-sea fish compared to organisms of other marine and freshwater taxa. Davis and his research team determined that there have been at least 36 different independent evolutions of fang-like teeth across 66 different families.† ""Oftentimes when you talk to somebody about deep-sea fishes, one of the first things they say is, ""òOh yeah, they're hideous. They have huge teeth,'""ù Davis said. ""There's a few different reasons for that.""ù Davis posited selective pressures found in the deep sea, such as the necessity for predatory fish to restrain prey items, which may explain the frequency of enlarged dentition and justify the investment necessary to develop such features.† ""Fangs often serve different functional roles other than dentition that may be found on the same bone. They may be used for prey capture, they sometimes can act as a cage, they sometimes can be used for piercing and restraints,""ù Davis explained.† After describing the incidence of those two convergent traits in ray-finned fishes, Davis ended the seminar with the disclaimer that speciation and diversification are mechanisms acted on by many different variables. ""There's never really necessarily one magic bullet ""¶ There are definitely different, different types of opportunities depending on different habitats and some of these gradients, but one thing I find really fascinating is that, on the macroevolutionary scale, there really is no one answer.""ù

science,UCSB Professor To Study Public Perception of NSF Synthetic Cells Projects,7-Nov-19,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-07/ucsb-professor-to-study-public-perceptions-of-nsf-synthetic-cells-projects/,"""Life, uh, finds a way.""ù The iconic line delivered by Jeff Goldblum's character, Dr. Ian Malcolm, in the 1993 film ""Jurassic Park""ù may soon apply to two new projects aiming to develop synthetic cells. The work will be ""testing the boundaries of life as we know it,""ù the National Science Foundation states. Harthorn and other researchers will provide a societal perspective on the National Science Foundation projects to construct synthetic neurons and synthetic functional, lipid-free cells. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Both funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), one project seeks to construct a synthetic neuron and programmable neuronal network and will be in development for the next four years. The other project, known as ProteoCell, will run for the next three years and has a goal to build functional, lipid-free, ""living""ù cells with proteins. These are under one of the NSF's long-term research priorities, Understanding the Rules of Life: Building a Synthetic Cell. With ambitious goals such as these, many questions can emerge, including the societal significance of synthetic cells as well as the potential benefits, risks and possibilities they bring. That's where Barbara Harthorn, a UCSB professor of anthropology, comes in. Along with her collaborators, Harthorn is providing a sociological and ethical perspective on the projects. They will focus on the public's views ""î their beliefs, attitudes, values and concerns ""î on synthetic biology as well as its societal implications, including how people make sense of the novel technologies involved in the work. Currently, the technologies have very low awareness in the United States, according to Harthorn. ""We're really trying to generate new knowledge about emergent public views about the risks and benefits of these kinds of new synthetic technologies,""ù Harthorn said. She and the other researchers will share this information with the scientists and engineers developing these synthetic projects, the government funding the work and the public and policymakers. ""Our aim is to gain information and share it,""ù Harthorn said. From an ethical standpoint, the public should be informed about technological developments to enable public participation, according to Harthorn. This may hold especially true in this context since these are publicly-funded research projects with potentially public ramifications. Under the principle of informed consent, people should be informed and ""have an opportunity to give or not [give] their consent.""ù ""If there are risks and hazards that emerge in the course of developing these new devices and technologies, then you really need knowledge about public views in order to do ethical and possible research,""ù Harthorn said. ""Meaning that you have to tailor that kind of creation provision to empirical data on different sectors or samples of the population.""ù Doing so requires social science research and is a component of responsible communication. For these projects, Harthorn will work to increase inclusion in responsible research and innovation and thus indirectly increase public participation. ""Part of that is because involving the public and engaging in transparent communication with the public about what's happening and how it might affect them is probably the only way to gain trust with the government and the industries,""ù she said. Having served as the director of the NSF Center for Nanotechnology in Society at UCSB (CNS-UCSB) for 11 years, Harthorn has plenty of experience in this line of work. She led a research team in conducting a study on risk perceptions regarding nanotechnologies for energy and health purposes from multiple parties ""î including the public, various experts, regulators, industries and NGOs in the United States and abroad. While Harthorn has dealt with studying complex technologies before, these new projects involving synthetic biology technologies will bring some different challenges. For instance, there is even lower public awareness of these technologies than of nanotechnology, she stated. To aid herself, Harthorn will employ both the methods and the knowledge from her previous CNS project to embark on these newer ones. The main research method she and her collaborators have been developing across the series of research projects is public deliberation. With it, they can engage the public under low-awareness conditions. They can also engage the public in a certain two-way dialogue that's focused on sharing enough information about the kinds of technologies that might be used. This can enable people to ""form their own view based on their own experiences, gender, race and ethnicity, their employment, etc.,""ù Harthorn described. Harthorn's overarching goal is to convey the societal ramifications of these technologies and help people gain an understanding of how they might be used in terms of balancing risk with benefits. Harthorn and her team are currently gearing up for their first year of public deliberation research, including developing the surveys that they will use for next year's work. One exciting component of these new projects for Harthorn is to work with UCSB students. ""Usually in the past, I've had postdoc researchers on this, but in this project, we're working with graduate student researchers here at UCSB. I'm looking forward to that. And there may be opportunities for undergrads to work as interns in this project.""ù

science,Fungus Among Us: Researchers Map Lineages of Chytrid Fungus Affecting Sierra Nevada Frogs,7-Nov-19,2:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-07/fungus-among-us-researchers-map-lineages-of-chytrid-fungus-affecting-sierra-nevada-frogs/,"Severe population decline of the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog and other amphibian species worldwide has been associated with chytridiomycosis, spread by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd. / Courtesy of Thomas Smith First identified in Australian frogs in the late ""ò90s, this disease has since been detected on every continent besides Antarctica, spurred in part largely by human activities. Roland Knapp, a research biologist at UC Santa Barbara's Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (S.N.A.R.L.) and Cherie Briggs, a professor in UCSB's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, have collaborated with other researchers from numerous institutions to better understand the genetic lineage of the fungus responsible ""î batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd ""î and trace its migration across the globe. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team detailed their methods for genotyping Bd DNA samples from skin swabs, as well as their discovery of BdASIA3, a divergent lineage of the fungus. The fungal infection, chytridiomycosis, parasitizes frogs by infecting skin cells, leading to hyperkeratosis, or a thickening of the skin, which compromises osmotic regulation and eventually leads to cardiac arrest. ""When it's in there, it disrupts the function of the cell. In doing so, it keeps the cells from removing waste and bringing nutrients in, and furthermore, by disrupting this process, the electrolyte balance of the frog is disrupted,""ù Thomas Smith, a colleague and frequent collaborator with Knapp at S.N.A.R.L., said. An obstacle to the genotyping of Bd has been the necessity to maintain pure cultures of the fungus. To circumvent this, the researchers collected skin swab samples and used a microfluidic PCR genotyping method, focusing in on almost 200 loci throughout the genome. ""There are different ways to sort of get the genes of the fungus off of the frog. Typically our group this year in the Sierra Nevada uses the skin swab. You just rub it on their belly and their legs and that gets the frog skin. Some of the frog skin gets on that giant Q-tip,""ù Smith said. ""The advantage to the skin swab method is that you can sample a lot of frogs very quickly. The greater range of sampling you have, the better you can represent all of the different possible variations in the genes relevant for the study,""ù he added. In contrast, while pure cultures maintained in petri dishes allow for the creation of very high quality samples, they are more labor-intensive and require lab infrastructure which is not always feasible in a field setting. Researchers at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory collect skin swab samples from the endangered Sierra Nevada frogs to better understand the genetic lineage of Bd. / Courtesy of Thomas Smith Bd poses an existential threat to hundreds of frog species, and it is widely distributed in habitats across the Americas. However, the virulence of Bd varies depending on lineage. ""This large cast of authors pooled all their DNA samples from Bd that they collected all over the world ""¶ A lot of these places are bases that Bd has caused major amphibian declines in some species, but not all. They were able to find different lineages of Bd and they found that these are local to different parts of the world and some of them overlap with each other,""ù Smith said. Of particular note was the known GPL, or the Global Pandemic Lineage. The lineage exhibits very little genetic variation, meaning that it likely is a new lineage that hasn't had the time to diversify during its global expansion. ""We study the Sierra Nevada frogs that live in the Sierra Nevada, so Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Those frogs are not doing well. They're federally and state-listed as endangered and there are very few healthy populations left. All of those frogs are infected with this Global Pandemic Lineage,""ù Smith explained. Previously undiscovered pockets of genetic diversity were found in Southeast Asia, widely distributed in the Philippines, Indonesia and parts of China. In the Philippines in particular, one sample had a unique genetic signature. It couldn't be assigned to any of the known lineages of Bd and lacked the characteristics of a mixed infection or a hybrid. The sample instead ""appears to be distinct from currently named lineages and possibly represents another undescribed, early branching lineage,""ù according to the paper. However, there is still much research to be done. ""There's a huge knowledge gap, and this disease has such a big impact on amphibians around the world. It's the largest disease-driven extinction in the history of biodiversity that we know about,""ù Smith said. ""Any amount of understanding we have of this disease is important for figuring out how to potentially approach management, stopping it in its tracks and restoring the amphibians that have been impacted by it.""ù

science,UCSB Researchers Investigate Snail Control Efforts To Combat Parasitic Disease,14-Nov-19,10:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/ucsb-researchers-investigate-snail-control-efforts-to-combat-parasitic-disease/,"Researchers in Senegal sample for freshwater snails that can transmit schistosomiasis among the unrooted, floating vegetation that is a robust predictor of their presence. / Courtesy of Kevin Lafferty, USGS Schistosomiasis, an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma, affects over 200 million people worldwide. Although not found in the United States, schistosomiasis is the second most devastating parasitic disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human infection occurs from contaminated freshwater, where freshwater snails carry larval blood flukes that can then penetrate a person's skin. Within the blood system, the larvae develop into their adult forms and release eggs. Symptoms occur from the body's reaction to the parasite's eggs and can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, possible liver enlargement and bloody urine and stool. While drugs such as praziquantel can be used to treat patients infected with schistosomiasis, ""the problem is people can get reinfected the day after they're dewormed,""ù said Armand Kuris, a professor of zoology in UCSB's evolution, ecology and marine biology department and a biology faculty member in the College of Creative Studies. Schistosomiasis control has largely been focused on mass drug administration. This approach has drastically reduced the rate of reinfection to a very low percentage ""î 2 or 3% ""î of infected people, according to Kuris. ""But if there's any sort of social disruption or any sort of competing costs for public health, and there always are, and for a while it's not continually pursued with the drug, the disease can come roaring back in three years,""ù he described. After recognizing that mass drug administration to try to curb transmission has been ineffective in some infected regions, the World Health Organization has come up with new strategies in addition to mass drug administration campaigns to combat global schistosomiasis. One is to target the freshwater snail hosts of these disease-causing parasites. Along with researchers from numerous other institutions, Kuris and U.S. Geological Survey and UCSB Marine Science Institute ecologist Kevin Lafferty are studying how to improve snail control efforts in West Africa. Their study site, the Lower Senegal River basin in northwestern Senegal, is where the world's largest recorded schistosomiasis epidemic occurred in the mid 1980s. ""In each village, there are two or three places where people go to water their animals or women gather to wash clothes at the same time. It's a social thing. There's a lot going on ""î kids are out there playing and so transmission occurs between people engaged in various social and economic activities,""ù Kuris said. ""They're interacting with snails that are releasing these worms that have about less than a day to penetrate the skin of a person.""ù Initially, the scientists tried methodically counting and tracking snail distributions as they found a positive relationship between the abundance of snail hosts and human schistosomiasis reinfection. ""It would be really good if we could figure out where the snails are, how many there are, so we would know which places need more help than others,""ù Kuris said. However, since the Senegal River is over 1,000 miles long and an open system, factors such as water movement, snail movement and wind can shift the locations of river features. ""It's just been very hard to figure out which places and which people are most at risk because of the problem of quantifying snails. If you go out and count the snails carefully on one month, you could come out the next month and you get a different number. Maybe even if you went out the next day, you get a different number,""ù Kuris described. Kuris and his collaborators looked for other ways to detect snail prevalence that could then predict human infection, such as through certain environmental factors. Their findings are detailed in a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They found that floating freshwater plants, which the snails feed on and cling to, were the most robust indicator of the presence of snails. ""If you could look at the plants ""î that really predicts where snails are. And you could do that more indirectly than going in very carefully and you counting snails,""ù Kuris explained. Villagers converge at a water access site in Senegal for social and economic activities, including bathing, doing laundry and providing water for livestock. / Courtesy of Kevin Lafferty, USGS With this ability to accurately predict where snails inhabit through tracking the floating vegetation, public health agencies have a better idea of which areas to address for treatment and can get a better sense of infection rates. Snail control efforts, including using chemicals to target the snails or placing snail predators, can also be carried out. ""Even though the percentage of people infected has gone down, the caseload has not gone down. It continues on up. This is the combination of medical issues, public health issues and ecology, because in the end, it's about studying snails,""ù Kuris said. Another key point in the study is the potential to use drone or satellite imagery instead of small surveys to track snail prevalence. The vegetation and other snail habitat features can be easily seen in aerial images. ""Now that we really understand that if we could get a good grip on quantifying the floating vegetation in particular, we could get a better idea of where the snails are and the infected snails are then likely to be by using this relatively inexpensive remote sensing approach. Because right now it's very expensive,""ù Kuris said. Instead of having trained people dedicate hundreds of hours to go out and attempt to estimate snail abundance and still end up with potentially fallible data due to temporal factors, remote sensing strategies may help provide accurate estimates of snail habitat coverage and site areas. This enables possible ""large-scale, high-resolution estimation""ù of infection risk, the paper states. In addition to providing a less costly method to study schistosomiasis transmission, satellites and drones can help regions with fewer resources to better control the spread of the tropical disease. ""There are other places that are much more challenging [to study than Senegal], and so a remote sensing approach will really help the work in some other areas,""ù Kuris said. Kuris emphasizes that coming up with a more effective approach to snail control will play a key role for global schistosomiasis control. He and his research team are also exploring the use of snail predators, including prawns, in the Senegal River to better control snail abundance. ""Because [the prawns] are crustaceans, they have shells. Calcium ions are uncommon in freshwater, and so edible calcium by eating snails really helps something like a crayfish or a prawn,""ù he said. ""This also can be applied to other areas where there's less money.""ù In this very extensive study, Kuris recognizes the contributions of his colleagues to the project. ""It's an honor and a challenge to be able to work in West Africa on something like this. You need a lot of very dedicated people ""¶ especially the Senegalese working on this.""ù

science,"Mental Health in Medicine: Presented by Vania Manipod, D.O., at UCSB",21-Nov-19,9:30 AM,"['Sean Crommelin', 'Jacqueline Wen']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/mental-health-in-medicine-presented-by-vania-manipod-d-o-at-ucsb/,"On Nov. 14, UCSB Phi Delta Epsilon, a co-ed medical fraternity, invited psychiatrist Vania Manipod to UCSB to speak on her experience dealing with psychological issues plaguing pre-med and medical students, namely burnout. Last week, psychiatrist Vania Manipod presented on mental health, including burnout, in medicine. SIAVASH GHADIRI / DAILY NEXUS Manipod, D.O., described her own experience with occupational burnout and how living with the condition led to her reevaluate her career and her priorities as a psychiatrist.† After years and years of schooling, Manipod entered the psychiatric profession, eager to connect with her patients and make an impact. She spent numerous sleepless nights cooped up studying. But her struggles in moving up through undergrad to reach medical school and residency ""î all of it finally paid off and netted her the job of her dreams. So as an attending physician, why was she so exhausted and unhappy? ""I hated seeing patients; why would I hate seeing patients, like this is what I went to school for! I hated waking up in the morning. All of a sudden I was like, ""òWhy do I not want to go to work?'""ù Manipod said. Manipod searched for answers online, hoping to bridge a gap in her knowledge and make a recovery plan but found a dearth of information. It was only until she discussed her symptoms with a therapist that a clearer picture began to emerge.† ""At that point, I thought, you know what, nobody's talking about this. This was 2014,""ù Manipod said. Although she was fearful of how the medical community would react, Manipod resolved to fill the void. She wrote a blog about her experiences with burnout as a psychiatrist.† ""I said, ""òScrew it, maybe other people are feeling this way.' It got posted on KevinMD, under the title ""òA psychiatrist is burnt out and depressed. Here's what she did about it,'""ù Manipod described.† ""When it first came out, I was mortified,""ù she continued. ""I thought to myself, ""òGreat, now everyone's going to think I'm a failure,' but instead ""¶ I got messages from doctors all over the world telling me, ""òThank you so much for writing about your experience. I feel the same way, and I feel like I'm not alone.'""ù Burnout is a state of exhaustion stemming from prolonged and excessive stress. According to Manipod, what makes burnout so pernicious is its tendency to linger and relapse quickly when the one afflicted is reintroduced to the source of their stress ""î even after they have taken time to relax and recover.† ""Say you have a midterm, maybe you feel burned out studying, but then you're done with midterms, you have Thanksgiving holiday and you're able to recover. When you're burned out, you're not able to recover,""ù Manipod stated.† A single source of stress is difficult to pinpoint. According to Manipod, often ""it's actually everything that has accumulated throughout our training that builds up to the point that we experience symptoms.""ù In other words, it's the sum total of a person's lost sleep, backlogged work medical notes and all of their other obligations which coalesce and coalesce into an inescapable feeling of fatigue and burden.† Someone with burnout begins to doubt the significance of their work, and they lose the sense of personal accomplishment which would normally provide momentum and motivation during times of stress.† ""We start to view our work negatively, without value and [as] meaningless. This doesn't make sense. I mean, all of you are striving to become a physician or whatever your career goals are; you're high-achieving. But despite this, we start to view all of those things as negative,""ù Manipod said.† Practitioners afflicted find themselves unable to connect with their patients. They may find themselves resenting the people they're meant to care for and develop a negative attitude toward seeing patients, according to Manipod.† ""I'm a psychiatrist and I love my patients, but when I was burned out, I was really hoping that none of my patients would show up, And then when a patient showed up, I was like, ""òUgh, I have to see a patient,' and that's when I knew that something was wrong.""ù† Manipod described the perfectionist mentality that many in the medical community have ""î something admirable and to a point, necessary, in such professions, but also something which leads to incredible stress. She pinpointed it as a reason for their tendency to blame themselves for their mental health issues.† ""I think what happens when we experience this is that us as pre-med, pre-health people, we internalize it, we think, ""òWhat's wrong with us?' We experience symptoms and we assume it's weakness.""ù However, she also stressed the systemic issues which contribute to burnout and brought to the audience's attention the general resiliency of prospective medical school students. Manipod cited a nine-year study from 2007 which assessed the personalities of incoming medical students, compared them to the U.S. general population and found the students to be livelier, more adaptive and more emotionally stable than the general population.† ""These are all factors that contribute to resiliency. I don't want people to assume that people who go into medicine are just prone to burnout because of who they are as people and their personalities. This is something that occurs over the course of our learning and our training. We start off being very resilient compared to the U.S. population,""ù Manipod noted.† That said, the medical track takes its toll on even the most resilient, and high incidences of burnout are indicative of this. According to Manipod, systems and institutions in their current form are not adequately resolving this. ""This is a system-wide issue. So many people are experiencing this, it's something that the systems need to be able to address as well. Burnout is not solely your problem. There are ways that we can learn to deal with our own individual stress, but it is a systemwide problem that educators and our health care system needs to address.""ù† SIAVASH GHADIRI / DAILY NEXUS A significant takeaway for many audience members was that they weren't the only ones having these feelings or thoughts relating to burnout, which was ""reassuring""ù for third-year biopsychology major Krystle Ortega. One common concern among pre-med students in the audience was hesitation over taking time for themselves ""î to practice self-care. ""I know before this talk I felt very guilty about taking a gap year before entering into medical school. But now I feel more comfortable about being able to take a gap year, that needed break from after doing four years at UCSB,""ù Angela Calaguas, a fourth-year biopsychology major, said. In addition to dealing with academic pressure, many pre-med students face familial pressure that may intensify their sense of burnout or mental health issues that they are experiencing.†† Calaguas said, ""It stems from being the first one in my family to pursue something higher than a bachelor's degree ""¶ I'm going to be the first person in my family who's going to be pursuing [medical school]. So that puts on a lot of familial pressure on me as a student.""ù Planning to pursue psychiatry, Ortega reported feeling pressure ""because what I'm doing is not something that is widely recognized, especially in just Asian cultures, in general or just even in the world ""¶ At least in collectivist cultures, [talking about mental health concerns] is widely looked down upon. In my family, it seems like you're either lazy or like you're faking, but it's more than that. [Mental health] is something I want to advocate.""ù Indeed, Asian-Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health services than their White counterparts, reports the American Psychological Association. Manipod's presentation personally resonated with Calaguas and Ortega for these reasons. ""I think the reason why we both really wanted to go to this event was because it's representation for us because we don't get as much representation of diverse people like her ""î †especially a Filipino ""î †[and] a woman in psychiatry, in the medical field. Especially someone who isn't afraid to pursue this subject matter,""ù Ortega said. Nicole Glick, the vice president of programming at Phi Delta Epsilon, organized the event as part of the fraternity's annual public Gelfand Lecture. Following their first lecture last year featuring a male physician with the San Francisco 49ers, Glick wanted to ""mix it up""ù and ""bring a woman to the table""ù to include ""more women representation in medicine on campus.""ù Glick, a third-year biopsychology major, found Manipod through Instagram and thought she would be ""a perfect speaker""ù since Manipod was based nearby in Ventura and ""mental health isn't talked about too much in the pre-health community here at UCSB.""ù Glick stated that she didn't perceive many mental health resources to be easily available or accessible on campus, and that she has to ""dive deep""ù if she wanted to find more information. Through hosting this event, she found it to be ""an easy way for people to come and gain some knowledge about how to maintain their mental health and avoid burnout, as opposed to diving deep into the pre-health advising pages about what kind of events, if any, are available to students.""ù One insight Glick took from the talk was to more seriously consider her mental health further along in her medical track.†† ""Sometimes we don't think ahead about how as pre-med students, if we continue these bad habits of not caring about our mental health, it can continue and then affect our [future medical] practice,""ù she remarked. Glick continued, ""I just wanted to bring that edge to this talk and I hope that people took something away from it and learned something ""¶ I hope that other people can take something away from her emphasis on taking breaks for yourself when you see that you really need it.""ù† After all, there is a danger to working endlessly.† Manipod described an impactful moment that stayed with her. ""I gave this talk one time in New York. And that was around the time that I think two medical students in New York had died from suicide. I kept thinking, ""òWhat if they felt less shame to take time off? Would they still be here?' I don't know. But maybe.""ù ""So that's why I always emphasize this. You might feel ashamed. We might feel like failures. But I'd rather have you here.""ù

science,You Reef What You Sow: Coral Reef Management and Status in a Warming World,21-Nov-19,2:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/you-reef-what-you-sow-coral-reef-management-and-status-in-a-warming-world/,"Undersea lands of superlatives, marine coral reefs are believed to be the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet ""î even surpassing tropical rainforests. They provide for humans: Reefs rake in tourism dollars, support fisheries that hundreds of millions rely on and buffer vulnerable coastal regions from large storms. They are also dying almost everywhere.† On Nov. 18, UCSB postdoc researcher Mary Donovan discussed her research on declining coral reefs around the world and the various scales of management which localities use to manage and protect them. / KIAYI YANG/ DAILY NEXUS On Monday, Nov. 18 in the Marine Science Institute Auditorium, the lab of ecology, evolution and marine biology professor Deron Burkepile invited Dr. Mary Donovan to discuss her research on declining coral reefs around the world and the various scales of management which localities use to manage and protect them.† An alumna of UCSB, Donovan traveled to Hawai'i after obtaining a B.A. to complete her M.S. and Ph.D. at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. She has since returned to UCSB as a postdoctoral researcher. While in Hawai'i, she led a project to compile coral reef-monitoring data for the archipelago.† ""Many reefs around the world are losing ecosystem function and declining to degraded states with a loss of coral cover, less fish and the proliferation of algae,""ù Donovan said. The presentation focused on three regions in particular: Moorea in French Polynesia, the Caribbean and Hawai'i. The presentation also examined the interrelations of different stressors ""î such as heat stress, land pollution and coastal development ""î causing bleaching events and coral die-offs. Marine heat waves have increased in frequency and duration across the globe, which has led to extensive coral bleaching and mass die-offs.† ""[Large bleaching events] used to happen, like in decadal intervals, typically associated with really large El Ninos like in 1980. But because of climate change, these heat waves are occurring more frequently, often every three to five years,""ù Donovan said.† ""This enormous threat from climate change is occurring against the backdrop of all these other threats that have been plaguing reefs for decades, so this creates a major challenge as all of these threats vary in spatial and temporal expanse.""ù Alongside the science, Donovan brought to attention the varying ways in which the scales of management overlap. The jurisdictional boundaries involved in the protection and management of coral reefs are not cut and dry. It can be difficult for those involved in management to reconcile the fact that environmental issues transcend region and locality. ""There's sometimes a debate about whether or not the management actions that they can implement at a local scale are going to make a difference. This is particularly true because risk management is often limited in capacity and in budgets. This forms the overarching motivation on my research, which is how do we make the best decisions for conservation given that, in an ecosystem, there are multiple threats operating at different scales?""ù Moorea, a coral atoll located in French Polynesia, has been an area of focus for researchers hoping to untangle the variables which are responsible for coral decline, namely heat intensity and land-based pollution. In one particular study, researchers observed the variable levels of bleaching which occurred in two coral taxa: Acropora and Pocillopora. They examined the conditions of various sites relative to one another according to heat stress and nitrogen, which was present due to runoff from land. ""What's really interesting is that when temperature is moderate or low you see a significant positive relationship between nitrogen and bleaching severity, meaning that at the highest levels of nitrogen we're gonna see more severe bleaching, even if the temperatures aren't as high,""ù Donovan said.† This effect was observed in both coral taxa. ""Why this really is important in the context is that we talked about how bleaching is becoming more frequent. As we see these more frequent events, we're going to see these low to moderate levels of heat stress much more often.""ù† KAIYI YANG/ DAILY NEXUS In the Caribbean, Donovan has done work with the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, gauging the status and trends of Caribbean coral reefs.† She described a long-term study looking into the status of reefs in relation to other fauna in various Caribbean reefs which found links between the extent of coral cover and the population of parrotfish.† ""We categorized locations whether or not they had low parrotfish, kind of implying that fishing was reducing parrotfish populations. We categorized places into these two groups, and then we look at their trajectories of coral over time. We [found] some interesting patterns,""ù Donovan said. There was a decline in coral cover everywhere. However, it was observed that in regions with an intact parrotfish population there was much greater variability in the condition of reefs, while regions with less robust populations were almost always in very poor condition at the end of the period. Donovan ended her talk by delving into her work in Hawai'i. She has led the Hawaii Monitoring and Research Collaborative, a ""project to collate existing data on underwater visual censuses of both benthic and fish assemblages into a unified database,""ù according to Donovan's website. In doing so, Donovan and her researchers aim to provide a frame of reference which localities may reference in order to better their management practices. ""We're working with local managers to provide a way forward and how we can make the best decisions given all this complexity,""ù Donovan said.† Natural variation in the ocean around the Hawaiian Islands makes qualitative evaluations of reefs difficult. The conditions of a site, which exists because of its location and natural coral cover, will change how metrics such as fish biomass and change over time will apply to a site's evaluation.† ""Understanding the natural bounds of the system is important for differentiating human-driven and natural-driven changes in the environment.""ù However, all of these variables must be considered if one desires to paint a clear picture of the ecological condition of reefs across the archipelago ""î and worldwide.† ""I started off asking, do local and global pressures interact? And I think we can safely say yes.""ù Now, one must consider, ""How do we make the best decisions at local levels""¶† and in the context of local environmental variation and human variation?""ù

science,"Racial Discrimination in Medicine: Physician Bias, Income and Mortality",25-Nov-19,10:00 AM,['Catherine Beaudin'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-25/racial-discrimination-in-medicine-physician-bias-income-and-mortality/,"On Monday, Nov. 18, UCSB's Broom Center for Demography invited Economics Professor Trevon Logan to speak on his research on the racial disparities in health care.† The seminar, ""Physician Bias and Racial Disparities in Health: Evidence from Veterans' Pensions,""ù held in North Hall's Thormahlen Family Seminar Room, focused on using Union Army pensions of Civil War veterans to estimate the effect of income on mortality.† Logan spoke about physician bias and racial disparities in health care as evidenced by Civil War veterans' pensions. / IDA KAZERANI / DAILY NEXUS Logan, the inaugural North Hall Chair of Economics, began with an overview of the environmental factors that have contributed to the Black-white mortality gap that has persisted in the United States for over 200 years.† ""In 1900, the Black-white differential in life expectancy was approximately 10 years. In 2010, the difference was five years, so it's only gone down by about 50%,""ù Logan said.† He made note of the multigenerational impact of malnutrition in slavery, urban migration and exposure to higher levels of disease prevalence, which all led to worse health outcomes for African Americans immediately after the Civil War.†† ""However, the effect of income on health was large enough to close the Black-white mortality gap in the period,""ù Logan stated.† In a sample size recently expanded to around 40,000 white veterans and 15,000 Black veterans, Logan and other researchers matched military records from the Civil War and post-war health records from the pension system to the socioeconomic status of veterans.†† Specifically with regard to Civil War pensions, Logan described how the probability of securing a pension was significantly higher for white veterans.† ""Black veterans were often unable to prove the relationship of their disability to the war experience because sick and injured Black soldiers were frequently unable to gain admittance to hospitals during the war,""ù Logan explained.††† He also delved into the three phases of the Civil War pension system. During the second phase from 1890 to 1907, any disability made a veteran eligible, but the condition had to be verified by a physician. A large gap between Black and white pensions specifically coincides with this period of physician subjectivity in rating disability.† A thorough examination of Surgeons' Certificates, records from the physical examinations completed by physicians to certify the disability status of veterans, revealed a lack of trust on behalf of white physicians who frequently brought the character and honesty of Black veterans into question.† According to Logan, Black veterans were three times more likely to be accused of ""exaggerating""ù their illness, six times more likely to be described as ""stupid""ù and 15 times more likely to be referred to as ""ignorant""ù by physicians.† When interpreting physician records, ""there is something odd about the commenting behavior of the physicians that is, in itself, very racialized,""ù Logan acknowledged.†† Additional evidence also suggests that racial bias was more common when diagnosing conditions that required a physician to trust the patient's descriptions, such as with digestive diseases. Addressing verifiable conditions, like cardiovascular disease, was more straightforward.† Another point of discussion was the historical context of scientific racism in medicine, which led to physicians viewing the ""Black body""ù as different during the 19th century.† Even during slavery, Black people were viewed as better equipped for working in the fields over other races due to perceived stronger immunity against diseases like cholera and malaria.† ""Beliefs that Blacks had higher pain tolerance led to physician bias when prescribing pain medication and altered medical opinions about Black pain levels,""ù Logan described.† Another leading view of the 19th century was that Black patients had lower lung capacity than white people, which is still the leading view among physicians today. According to Logan, this also led to Black people being underrated for disability, resulting in smaller Union Army pensions.† ""Today, African Americans are still underrated for disability under current veterans pension programs in the United States,""ù Logan said.† Although his research focused primarily on Black veterans and Civil War pensions, Logan noted that ""rampant discrimination in the system""ù resulted in Black women being denied welfare during the 20th century.† ""Government policies have contributed to the health gap in a direct manner, as with policies related to housing and the formation of ghettos,""ù Logan emphasized.† Logan ended the seminar by highlighting that the primary goal of his research was to improve understanding of racial differences in the United States during the 20th century.† ""Physician bias continues to this day, and it plays a role in health outcomes. We find that even at a time when medical care was not particularly beneficial, physicians exhibited a high degree of bias against their Black patients.""ù

science,A Sunsational Study: UCSB Researchers Examine Political Identities and Participation of U.S. Solar Households,5-Dec-19,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-05/a-sunsational-study-ucsb-researchers-examine-political-identities-and-participation-of-u-s-solar-households/,"Climate change has undeniably become a politicized and ideologically polarizing topic, especially in the United States. To effectively address environmental issues such as energy sources, political participation and communication from mass publics across different parties will be essential.† One major step toward that is to know your audience.†† Mildenberger's study looked at the political identities and participation of U.S. households with residential solar installations. / Courtesy of Roland Balik Matto Mildenberger, an assistant professor in UCSB's department of political science, has mapped out the political identities of American households with solar installations. Along with UCSB graduate student Chris Miljanich and Utah State University's associate professor Peter Howe, Mildenberger examined the current state of environmental politics in the U.S. through comparing rates of Democratic and Republican solar energy adoption. ""In maybe the last five or six years, there's been a real emergence of an anti-clean energy position inside the Republican Party,""ù Mildenberger said. For instance, he cites the legislation that Ohio passed over the summer to subsidize coal plants and reduce numerous energy laws in the state. ""But there's also, on the other hand, a lot of clean energy activists who are Republican,""ù Mildenberger continued. ""So we wanted to understand: Are clean-energy Republicans the exception or the norm? ""¶ One way to look about that is to see who is it that's building solar on their roofs.""ù Mildenberger and his team used satellite imagery data collected through Google's Project Sunroof to identify which houses in various representative communities had solar panels. They then looked at publicly available voter file data that revealed the political party registration of individuals in that household as well as whether they voted in primary elections or general elections. After amassing and combining all the information, Mildenberger and his colleagues detailed their findings in a new paper published in Nature Energy.†† They reported that 34% of solar households are registered Democrats and 20% of solar households are registered Republicans. In neighboring control non-solar households, 31% are Democrats and 22% are Republican. Thus, despite solar household installations occurring more frequently in Democratic areas, members of both parties are equally likely to have households with solar installations in those neighborhoods. ""If you look inside a neighborhood, Republicans and Democrats have the same probability of having solar,""ù Mildenberger said. ""There's no real evidence that, for instance, people who are more liberal are adopting solar sooner than people who are more conservative.""ù While he acknowledges that solar energy adoption is ""still a very ideologically diverse behavior""ù and that more Democrats than Republicans have solar households across America, ""this is just a function of the fact that basically more Democrats have more solar.""ù For example, states like California have numerous solar developments and more Democrats than Republicans live in California, Mildenberger explained. Another significant finding in the study is that politically active people are much more likely to have solar households than less politically active people. Residents in solar households are substantially more likely to vote in general, primary and municipal elections. This association persisted even after considering a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic attributes. Although many climate and energy issues are polarized across political parties in the U.S. today, the paper's conclusions indicate that clean energy still has much bipartisan behavior in that members of both parties are adopting this technology. ""I think that's helpful because it suggests that even as climate and energy issues remain really polarized, there is a growing group of Republicans and Democrats who have a personal stake in the energy transition and might become political allies in trying to solve the problem of climate change,""ù Mildenberger said. Mildenberger's broader research program focuses on the politics of climate change and related projects. For this particular project, he plans to follow up with surveying and studying some of the solar households in greater detail to understand their motivations in adopting solar. ""We now know that Republicans and Democrats are adopting solar in similar proportion, [but] are they adopting it for the same reasons?""ù Mildenberger asked. ""Or are there still different reasons that are sort of behind those adoption rates?""ù†

Events were subdivided into three different tracks which were held in the different sections of Corwin Pavilion. These were the Genesis Track, the Education Track and the Development Track.† Blockchain is an encrypted ledger system composed of records known as blocks which are linked together with cryptography.†† ""Think of a database ""î but the database isn't stored in one place. It's stored in many, many places sort of decentralized all over the planet,""ù said Brian Fox, a computer programmer and free software advocate who presented in the seminar ""Preserving Democracy With Open Source Technology.""ù ""There's this data that is stored all over the place on lots of people's computers, like your computer, my computer and so forth. So if my copy of the database goes away, you still have a copy of the database. Now the information that's stored in the database is encrypted, depending on who put it in. So even though I'm storing that information, I can't read it unless I have the actual key to unlock that information.""ù Resistant to tampering, open-source and very secure, blockchain was originally created to serve as the transaction ledger for Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. It has since been seen as an attractive medium by which one can carry out digital voting, data sharing, data backup and recordkeeping, among other things. Fox spoke on his experiences in the tech world and his advocacy for open-source voting software, as opposed to proprietary software currently used in many localities. In this case, the use of blockchain would prevent fraud and lessen vulnerability to manipulation.† ""So in the sense of the summit, it's like blockchain is kind of a broad, not umbrella term, but it has implications which are more abstract to all of these specific things,""ù Fox said. One panel called ""Blockchain Abroad""ù featured panelists from various countries who spoke on the state of cryptocurrency and similar technologies in their respective countries. / Courtesy of Sean Crommelin Perhaps most prominently featured at the summit were discussions of the role of personal data and personal privacy in the digital era. A number of panels intended to dissect and evaluate how private companies have balanced respecting the privacy of users with using data in order to tailor advertising.† The keynote address, entitled ""The Weaponization of Personal Data,""ù featured an interview with Julian Wheatland, the former acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica, by journalist Rachel Wolfson.†† Best known for being embroiled in a scandal regarding its involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign of Ted Cruz, Cambridge Analytica was a British political consulting firm which shuttered in May 2018 after the news broke that an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, was sending data from users taking a Facebook personality quiz ""î and the data of users associated with those who took the quiz ""î to Cambridge Analytica without the consent of the vast majority of those affected. The firm acquired the personal data of 87 million Facebook users through the app ""This is Your Digital Life,""ù and in doing so, breached Facebook's terms of service. Cambridge Analytica was in turn banned from advertising on Facebook's platform.† Wheatland acknowledged and expressed remorse toward Cambridge Analytica's involvement, although he attempted to dispel more heinous accusations levied against Cambridge Analytica by claiming that information was never used for anything beyond advertising.† ""What Cambridge Analytica was doing at its core was not hacking into people's minds and getting them to do stuff against their will. What it was doing was making advertising more efficient,""ù Wheatland said.† However, speaking more broadly, Wheatland drew a distinction between the different types of data which are of interest to different parties and brought attention to the fact that tailoring advertising to individuals using data is not unethical in and of itself and can be used to increase the efficiency and efficacy of advertising.† ""There's lots of different types of data. I mean, the fact that someone might know [that] I like fast cars is fine with me. Knowing the balance of the bank account is different ""¶ it's not protecting data with marketers in particular,""ù Wheatland said.† Instead, Wheatland expressed a desire to give users more leverage in deciding how information can be used and put some responsibility on firms to give back to their customers without stifling ""business model innovation.""ù† ""If you look at the Googles and you look at the Facebooks, they're not just making profits off the data, they're making super profits, and you know, all power to them. But I think it's about time that some of that was shared back with the users, and I think that there is space there.""ù In effect, according to Wheatland, conduct and transparency in managing user data are what define ethical versus unethical data analytics. If data analytics can communicate to people more effectively by harnessing data, and if the efficiency in marketing products and services can be improved with data, then the question of ethical use is a ""how""ù question, not a yes-or-no question of whether using data itself is unethical. ""I want this question of ethics, and corporate ethics, and this idea of having ethical management. This, I think, is something that we desperately need ""¶ and there is not yet enough people dealing with the practicalities of it,""ù Wheatland said. Other panels, such as ""Blockchain Legal Frameworks,""ù featuring event speakers Morvareed Salehpour, Mark Hiraide and Emilio Cazares and moderated by Veronica Reynolds, focused on the establishment of legal frameworks for the use of blockchain technologies and the role of regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in creating and regulating cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency markets.† ""In the long term, we're going to see this digitization of everything and to get there is going to take some action from our legislators to be able get more movement. Because right now, in order to do something really innovative, there is a high cost to legal and appliance and all that, and in turn, a lot of risk,""ù Salehpour said. Panelists described how, in many aspects, governments have not reacted appropriately to different forms of technological innovation, and how the United States in particular has expressed a certain unwillingness to reconcile the idea of embracing new technology with their role in acting as a regulatory body.† ""Facebook decided to announce Libra, [and] our congressman decided to react with, ""òStop this from happening,' versus, ""òWe do need to digitize, like how do we do that in a way where the tech isn't self-regulated and so that we have a way to control it and make sure that everything is being done in the proper way,'""ù Salehpour mentioned. However, with the SEC in particular, Hiraide described how the commission is tasked with simultaneously cultivating innovation while also acting in the best interests of investors and administering effective securities laws.† To illustrate, the panelists discussed an instance when the SEC halted an unregistered digital token offering by the messaging app firm Telegram, which managed to raise $1.7 billion from investors.†† ""Fully decentralized systems ""¶ may sound good in theory, but in effect, to have business, we need some kind of centralization to degree. That's the only way it's going to work. That's why these enterprise applications have stronger credit right now,""ù Salehpour said. ""When something goes wrong, you're able to find who is responsible. Otherwise, as you get more decentralization, you have things such as no operator liability, and you get parties that shouldn't necessarily be liable being called into court.""ù Moderated by Veronica Reynolds,""ùBlockchain Legal Frameworks""ù featured event speakers Morvareed Salehpour, Mark Hiraide and Emilio Cazares, who discussed the establishment of legal frameworks for the use of blockchain technologies. / Courtesy of Sean Crommelin Despite these hiccups and philosophical hangups, there has been progress. Firms have been more cooperative with the SEC, and the SEC has been more cooperative and willing to engage in dialogue with firms.† ""That's encouraging, because it looks like the SEC is recognizing that they can't keep hammering these companies ""¶ Telegram [was] very publicly kind of against the SEC, but I think we're going to see a little bit of easing and a little more clarity,""ù Hiraide said.† The panel that was potentially most relevant to students interested in becoming involved with blockchain technology in a professional or academic capacity was the ""State of Blockchain Education,""ù which consisted solely of students in blockchain organizations. Panelists included Piergiacomo Palmisani, the president of Blockchain at UCSB; Andrew Battat, the co-president of Blockchain at UCLA; Ryan Eshaghi, the president of Blockchain at UCI; Kaushal Saraf, the co-founder of USC Dev Nights; and Rustie Lin, the EVP of education in Blockchain at UC Berkeley. The panel was moderated by Dr. Lene Martin, the founder and director of Blockchain at Pepperdine.† The panelists described the general wariness of higher education in establishing a blockchain curriculum and starting blockchain courses. They also covered the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation's progress in bringing more legitimacy to blockchain technology's uses as well as in integrating it into the greater sphere of academia.† ""They kind of want to see if we can prove ourselves ""¶ especially because this is an emerging technology. So it's pretty new. They don't really know much about it. They don't really want to put their brand behind it,""ù Palmisani stated. Despite this, Palmisani, hailing from Italy and having obtained his B.S. in Economics from Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, was quick to emphasize how being in the UC system has granted students greater opportunities than what can be found in many other institutions.†† ""On the other side, I know how in reaching an audience, the amount of resources and opportunities that are present here, especially the UC system and California universities in general, is amazing. So for me, this was amazing,""ù Palmisani said.† Other panelists spoke on establishing blockchain curriculum with the help of people in the industry and academia itself, especially as interest in blockchain among the student body in various institutions continues to grow exponentially. ""One thing I do want to say is that having industry advisors and people who are experts in the field help with an academic organization is tremendously helpful, because in a traditional classroom setting, they have outdated models, and they have to follow very, very rigid sets of curriculum that have been going on for the past five to 10 years,""ù Eshaghi said.† According to Eshaghi, having a student club that can run workshops and seminars with input from companies allows one to work with a new set of perspectives and ideas which are more current and relevant to the industry that students may want to enter.† ""That's exactly what those companies are pushing. It's initiatives that they want to be spending money on, and it gives the students a better connection to the industry versus, like, going to a career fair and doing things very, very traditionally.""ù And it seems that, in many cases, those connections pay off.† ""I actually had a student come up to me sometime last year, and he told me that he actually got a full-time job out of just coming to one of our events. I think it's really moments like that, especially [with] this particular emerging technology, that make it so exciting for me and a lot of other guys.""ù Eshaghi said.†

science,Researchers Compare Computational Models of Mate Preference Integration Across 45 Counties,13-Dec-19,7:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-13/researchers-compare-computational-models-of-mate-preference-integration-across-45-counties/,"Conroy-Beam and over 100 researchers tested various computational models to determine which was most accurate in predicting how we integrate information about potential romantic partners to subsequently choose one. / Courtesy of PxHere What we look for in a romantic partner can vary drastically from individual to individual. And chances are, we won't find someone who will perfectly possess all of the attributes of our dream person. We're required to compromise when choosing from an assortment of potential mates who fulfill just a subset of our ideal standards. To study how we assimilate information about the desired qualities of a potential partner in order to help inform the process of choosing a mate, scientists can use computational models. Over 100 researchers including Daniel Conroy-Beam, a UCSB assistant professor in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, sampled nearly 14,500 people from 45 countries to compare various computational models of mate preference integration. In their paper published in Scientific Reports, the researchers investigated eight different human mating models to determine which can most accurately predict our realized mate choices. Originally organized in Poland, the project was headed by Agnieszka Sorokowska and Piotr Sorokowski, who both created the protocols involved and recruited the laboratories that contributed data. Conroy-Beam and his colleagues collected the American data and were largely responsible for the computer simulations and data analysis for the sections on human mating. Each of the studied models makes different assumptions about how we characterize mate preferences and how we integrate them. Some models assume preferences behave as weights: ""More of this trait is really good""ù or ""More of this trait doesn't really matter,""ù Conroy-Beam described via email. Others describe preferences as thresholds ""î ""You have to be at least this kind to be my partner""ù ""î or as templates such as, ""A partner would be this intelligent.""ù† ""The best model, the Euclidean model, is one that assumes your preferences are like a template of an ideal partner and when you're evaluating someone as a partner, what you are doing is calculating the distance between that real partner and your ideal template,""ù Conroy-Beam said.†† Previous research has shown that some common preference criteria for potential partners span across cultures including intelligence, kindness, health, physical attraction and financial prospects, according to the study. Based on these five traits, the collaborators set up agent-based models, a computer simulation involving different autonomous agents who interact with others. They found that how agents paired with partners most closely followed a Euclidean mate preference integration algorithm. Agents selected partners based on how well their prospective mate matched their ideal partner template. Additionally, agents with higher mate value ""î or a summary of the desired qualities of a potential partner ""î often have more choices in choosing a partner. They tend to set higher standards, pair with partners who better matched their preferences and pair with other higher mate value people. That is, ""there is ""òassortative mating' for mate value ""¶ partners tend to be similar to one another in their mate value,""ù Conroy-Beam explained. ""We were able to show that this is a fairly diagnostic signature of Euclidean mate choice ""¶ other models of mate choice do not perfectly reproduce this pattern of results,""ù he continued. When applying their agent-based model-trained regression models to test real human mate choice data from around the world, the authors found further support for a Euclidean algorithm predicting mate preference integration most accurately. Within current relationships, reported relationship dissatisfaction could be predicted from discrepancies in Euclidean mate value, the paper states. The project recruited people in existing relationships and retrospectively analyzed their mate choices. Conroy-Beam hopes to expand using the models to predict future mate choices of single participants. He and his team also plan to survey more models. ""We are working on a few projects now in which we dramatically expand the number of alternative models we are able to compare which we are hoping will let us drill down into even more accurate models in the future,""ù Conroy-Beam said. Overall, this study provides insight into the process people undertake when picking their romantic partners. ""[Y]our choice of a romantic partner is likely one of the most important decisions you ever make. It affects every corner of your life and has well-documented impacts on your physical health, your mental health, and your financial well being,""ù Conroy-Beam said.† ""If we can build more accurate models of how people make this decision, hopefully we can start to apply those models to help people make better choices.""ù

The aerial image shows the erupting vent and near-vent part of the channel, which sends lava toward the coast and ocean. / Courtesy of United States Geological Survey The active Kilauea Volcano on the island of Hawaii erupted nearly continuously from 1983 until April 30, 2018. The 35-year-long eruption ended when the volcano's Pu'u ""òO'o crater collapsed. Days later, on May 3, the eruption patterns changed when fissures appeared in a flank area of the volcano known as the East Rift Zone. Magma then migrated to this spot, more than 40 kilometers from Kilauea's summit. The magma reservoir drained, and the surface of an active lava lake at the volcano's summit fell by over 1,000 feet. The resulting caldera, or volcanic crater formed as magma withdrew from a major storage reservoir, collapsed. Over the three-month eruption, the caldera continued to expand with a total collapse area of around 5 km2. By the time the volcanic activity stopped on Aug. 4, over 700 homes had been destroyed and thousands had been evacuated. It was Kilauea's largest eruption in over 200 years. Scientists' understanding of collapsing volcanic calderas had been severely limited by poorly-documented caldera-forming eruptions up until this 2018 outburst. With an extensive monitoring network and direct visual observations, they were able to closely track the events of Kilauea's caldera collapse. Outlined in a paper published in Science, researchers, including Mengyang Gu, an assistant professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, investigated various volcanic conditions to evaluate how they related to Kilauea's caldera collapse. One of the study's goals was to determine the geometry of the magma reservoir. As a statistician, Gu helped run computer coding to combine the various types of data that were tracking the small ground changes leading up to the eruption, including Interferometric Synthetic-Aperture Radar (InSAR). The researchers also used GPS to track the directional changes of the ground at various locations. ""We have two data which evaluate the derivative of the ground changes,""ù Gu explained. ""We needed to combine those data and then try to make an inference of quite a few problems, like where the magma chamber is, how large it is, what is the geometric shape of it and how fast the magma outflow [related to] pressure changes [affects the caldera collapse].""ù Gu also lent his expertise in constructing the team's physical model that linked the data to what was occurring underneath the earth's surface in order to understand the physical process that led to the caldera collapse. In addition to writing code to form a more complete picture of the data, Gu helped analyze the results using Bayesian statistics, which are used to predict the probability of an event. Even after much analysis, the scientists found that there were still numerous unresolved, confounding issues. For example, in trying to figure out the geometry of the magma chamber, the researchers drew two potential possibilities from the data. The reservoir was either a smaller, shallower one of perhaps 1,000 kilometers in diameter or a deeper, larger chamber that was more than 2,000 kilometers wide. ""We think from the data it is like a large chamber with a small volcano and a little deeper, not a shallow, very small chamber ""¶ [But] this type of confounding is well known in mathematical statistics, and we need to use some method to solve it. This is still an open issue.""ù The study's exploration may provide scientists with the insight necessary to extrapolate about Kilauea's future eruptions. ""People also care about forecasting when it will erupt. It's a hard question, forecasting, but it also depends on what kind of forecasting. Something like Kilauea ""î because it keeps erupting ""î we want to predict how much it will erupt [in terms of] magma and the size,""ù Gu said. Forecasting is especially imperative in this active volcano's case, as it's a matter of when and not if, according to Gu. The study concluded that a caldera collapse can occur after only a small fraction of stored magma has receded. ""People feel that [eruptions] may stop, that all the magma has already erupted or more than half of it has. But actually, from our inference, it's only like 4 to 5 percent of the magma that has erupted. There's still quite a bit of magma underneath the crater,""ù Gu stated. The statistical techniques used to process the data from the 2018 eruption can be applied to other similar studies, Gu mentioned, such as in estimating the location of a magma chamber as well as the critical pressure change rate that precedes a caldera collapse. ""This can be used in not only volcanoes but other things, probably, because many data like InSAR radar imaging is also used for earthquakes quite a lot,""ù he pointed out. The sole statistician among a group of volcanologists, Gu said, ""I hope there will be more collaborations like this. As a statistician, I need to talk to [other collaborators]. These topics are really useful to me. And then [they need] my knowledge [of] how to combine this data properly, how to address those biases and how to, for example, how to make their model fast, doable ""¶ Collaboration makes these things work.""ù

science,"One Limb, Two Limb, Left Limb, Right Limb: The Ground Rules of Planar Cell Polarity",9-Jan-20,1:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/one-limb-two-limb-left-limb-right-limb-the-ground-rules-of-planar-cell-polarity/,"Morphogenesis is one of the most fundamental aspects of development in multicellular organisms. The subdivision of cells in a body to perform different functions and orient themselves relative to other cells is so foundational as to be unnoticeable, flying over the heads of most people. Planar cell polarity, or PCP, is the polarity axis by which cells are arranged in the tissue along a two-dimensional plane. Liken it to a compass which informs how the placement of a cell dictates what direction it will grow and how this cell likewise dictates how the cells around it grow. Yet so little is known about how this process actually works. How do the mechanisms and organic molecules that govern morphogenesis interact on the inter and intracellular levels to ensure proper development? What are the rules for planar cell polarity? Shahriar Shadkhoo, a researcher in UC Santa Barbara's Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, has sought to answer some of these questions through a generalized reaction-diffusion model. In a paper published in the Public Library of Science (PLOS), Shadkhoo laid out some ground rules for planar cell polarity. ""You can go from an almost featureless or at least seemingly featureless, highly symmetrical object ""¶ to an organism, which is highly structured and capable of doing many different tasks,""ù Shadkhoo said, describing the process of morphogenesis through symmetry breaking. The way in which structural symmetry is broken and complexity forms in an organism depends on the directional instructions given to cells, provided by pathways known as planar polarity pathways. This is carried out through cytoplasmic interactions within the cell and membrane proteins between cells. ""Each cell has a pool of different types of plasma protein. What happens during the formation of polarity is that in each cell individually the proteins that are responsible for providing these kinds of directional information are segregated to the opposite sides of the cell,""ù Shadkhoo described. The left panels demonstrate the intracellular interactions among the membrane proteins, which lead to the redistribution of the proteins from an intermixed (top) to a segregated state (bottom). The right panel illustrates the effect of elongation on the direction of polarization. Cellular geometric information like elongation becomes accessible to proteins through the nonlocal intracellular interactions. / Courtesy of Shahriar Shadkhoo Through the models, Shadkhoo found that the length scale of interactions between plasma proteins influenced the development of the polarity axis across cells. ""What we found was that there is a minimum length scale, the length of interaction must exceed a lower limit in order for the polarity to become established across the tissue,"" Shadkhoo said. In physics, length scale refers to the order of magnitude by which a function operates. Imagine the function mapped out on a graph. A small length scale would mean a choppy line, with many dips and rises. A large length scale creates a smooth line, with a more cohesive structure and trend in the long term. Length scale informs a protein's level of consideration for the prevailing trend amongst others around it. ""So if the length scale of the interactions between the protein are very small, if each protein is only caring about its very, very small immediate vicinity, it would not be able to conspire, I would say, to establish the polarity, whereas if the length scales are larger they are able to interact with each other constructively in a way that gives rise to polarity,""ù Shadkhoo stated. In turn, it was found that length scale influences the geometry of cells in other ways too. ""Interestingly enough, this comes with some consequences that are about the geometry of cells,""ù Shadkhoo said. Shadkhoo brought to attention the elongation of tissue caused by polarization, observed in animals such as mice and Drosophila flies. ""For instance in mice, what happens is that their body starts growing faster than the tissue and then the tissue is stretched,""ù he said. ""So basically, this polarity is reading out the information of the geometry of the cell which is stretching yourself in that direction. And then the polarity rotates itself perpendicular to that axis of stretching or axis of location.""ù ""And so, these are, I think some consequences of that link scale that I was talking about earlier. If that link scale is zero or approaches zero and is very, very small, the effect of geometric readout would not appear at all,""ù Shadkhoo continued. Thus, a relationship could be established between elongation and the quantifiable value of the length scale. The perpendicular orientation of elongated tissues was not a local effect, but rather a collective one amongst many different cells. ""It was an interesting consequence of the fact that the length scale does not approach zero, but [instead] actually has some finite value. It is larger than point one of the cell diameter. These geometric results are a consequence of this nonlocality of the intracellular interaction,""ù Shadkhoo said. That is to say, intercellular and intracellular forces work in tandem throughout morphogenesis, and even compensate for one another. ""The absence of intercellular interactions can be partially compensated for by intracellular interactions. So, even if you lack a little bit of intercellular interaction for some reason, you could partially take care of that by adding a little bit of intracellular interaction,""ù Shadkhoo said.

science,The Code Less Traveled: SB Hacks 2020 Focuses on Hacker Experience,16-Jan-20,8:30 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/the-code-less-traveled-sb-hacks-2020-focuses-on-hacker-experience/,"For 36 hours from 5 p.m. on Friday to 9 a.m. on Sunday, over 340 coders worked tirelessly in Corwin Pavilion. Furnished with rows of tables cluttered with laptops, cords, models and even electric fans, RC cars and 3D printers churning out robotic arms, the event venue played host to SB Hacks VI, UC Santa Barbara's largest annual hackathon. Surrounding this potpourri of prospective coders on all fronts were sponsorship booths and mentoring engineers on call ""î some students in graduate school and others professionals from various industries ""î all keeping a watchful eye on these could-be recruits. At SB Hacks VI from Jan. 10-12, Colorado School of Mines' Peter Wilson, Van Wagner and Josh Rands worked on their grand prize-winning project to build a robot that could identify and locate a person having a heart attack and deliver an AED defibrillator to them. / Courtesy of Sean Crommelin Co-directed by Jennifer Lai and Esther Liu, who worked alongside a team of six other organizers, SB Hacks VI marked a significant departure from last year in terms of management style, permitting fewer participants and putting an emphasis on bringing more local flavor to the competition. ""Last year, we had about 450 hackers. This year, we're closer to 340. So, about a 100 people difference. And the biggest reason for that is because Jennifer and I decided that we want to completely redo our mission statement as SB Hacks,""ù Liu said. Citing Santa Barbara's relative geographic isolation from traditional tech hotspots to the north and south, the organizers decided that, rather than compete with hackathons such as Cal Hacks or LA Hacks, SB Hacks would ""realign [their] focus on the hackers themselves,""ù according to Liu. ""To us, that looks like saying, okay, since we're so isolated already, let's try to bolster our own [computer science] community.""ù ""Our computer science department is much smaller than other schools. We want to give freshmen opportunities to come to a hackathon to make a project, because at our school we don't have so many large companies and a lot of freshmen don't have coding experience going into their second year,""ù Liu said. Priority was given to local students for this reason. ""If we're raising so much money to throw a hackathon at UCSB, the point is to cater to our community, as opposed to other people from different schools.""ù Still, SB Hacks VI was a tremendous event, dominating Corwin Pavilion, drawing applicants from as far away as Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, offering $29,000 worth of prizes and bringing 25 sponsors to campus, including Google Cloud, Amazon Alexa and Lockheed Martin. Local companies were also incentivized to sponsor SB Hacks in order to foster a connection between computer science students on campus and businesses in the surrounding area. ""When we pitched the sponsors, we have a practice developed for them that tells them under which tier they'll fall; if they give us X amount of money, they'll receive [certain] benefits. For the local companies, we gave them a much better deal than say larger companies like Google or Amazon,""ù Liu stated. There was an emphasis on bringing sponsors closer to the process with sponsor exhibitions, where sponsors could keep booths on the competition floor. According to Liu, hacker experience was a big focus for organizers compared to last year, with new initiatives to improve accessibility. Transportation logistics were one such change made in order to improve the experience of the competitors and to streamline travel. Some buses provided transportation to and from specific campuses, and a carpooling and reimbursement plan was put into place for students from more remote places. ""[Transportation] to the competition has been an issue in the past. We've had buses before, and we still do, but then we're alienating every student who's coming from a school that the bus isn't being sent to,""ù Liu said. ""It's kind of like if you don't go to a bigger school, you have to figure it out yourself. So I just wanted to be a little more inclusive than that.""ù ""So myself and two other organizers just made sure we can arrange a travel reimbursement or carpooling plan, which was very much inspired by the UCSB rideshare page for both the Bay Area and SoCal,""ù Liu added. A significantly leaner team of eight organizers orchestrated the event, in contrast to last year's team, which was comprised of 20. Liu noted that the team of organizers often started the quarter strong, but struggled as the quarter progressed. During exam periods, ""people would sort of drop off and then sort of drop the ball,""ù Liu said. In response to these challenges, spring 2019 was marked by a re-interview process for every single organizer. ""We wanted to engage with people and ask if they are truly dedicated to the cause, or if they were just here for the resume booster,""ù Liu said. Rather than give individual organizers specialized roles, the directors approached the event with a more ""big picture""ù style of management, hoping to improve productivity and ensure that all organizers were competent in handling any circumstances which could arise. Courtesy of Sean Crommelin On the competition floor, the coders and their group mates labored over their projects for hours on end, working to sync up associated hardware, troubleshoot bugs or even completely overhaul an unworkable concept. ""Something people don't realize is that programming takes a ton of time even for the smallest things, especially because these kinds of events are about learning. That's one of the benefits of this 36-hour timeframe: people can stay up as late as they want. And a lot of programmers tend to do that where you'll get onto a problem, and you'll just keep on working on it until you solve it,""ù Akshay Heda, an organizer and competitor last year, said. For some students, SB Hacks provides one of few opportunities at UCSB to observe principles of coding and computer science learned in class through the messy, muddy lens of reality and practical application. ""It's kind of interesting to see some of them working on their homework and then trying to apply those algorithms and also learn the confusing practical actual designs as compared to all the theory they get in classes, because it's often a complete mess in reality,""ù said Matthew Dupree, a fourth-year student in computer engineering who worked as a mentor during the competition. The breadth of subjects covered in a hackathon is immense ""î one could even say it's all encompassing. ""[You have] people trying to build a sensor net to detect wildfires. There's people trying to make ""òWhere's Waldo' in Google Street View. There's people trying to make vending machines that are kept in people's homes,""ù Dupree said. Some well-known start-ups ""î such as GroupMe, during TechCrunch 2010 ""î were first conceived at a hackathon. ""Definitely people want their project to have practical application. You want to build something that has long-term competitive potential, like a lot of start-ups and small projects were conceived of during a hackathon and then they were like, developed further after,""ù Lucien Luc, a first-year computer science major who competed for his first time this year, said. Luc and his teammates devised an alarm which would rouse a person out of slumber through the use of a fan which would vary in intensity according to the brain activity of a user. However, the grand prize winners were a group of four men from the Colorado School of Mines ""î Van Wagner, Parker Steen, Peter Wilson and Josh Rands ""î who built a robot programmed to deliver an AED defibrillator to someone suffering a heart attack. ""Our idea was that we normally observe that AEDs are distributed sporadically throughout large buildings and are pretty hard to find,""ù Wagner said. The robot would identify someone having a heart attack through computer vision, identify where an afflicted person was located and then navigate over to them. ""We wanted to basically use security camera footage to see if somebody's having a heart attack, and then make something that could deliver the AED to them, instead of having to wait for somebody to go find it.""ù

science,Seeing the Forest AND the Trees: Predicting Forest Responses to Contrasting Climate Change Influences,16-Jan-20,1:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/seeing-the-forest-and-the-trees-predicting-forest-responses-to-contrasting-climate-change-influences/,"As the effects of climate change continue to escalate, their impacts seem especially noticeable and imminent for humans and other animals. But what about for forests and trees? In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Anna Trugman, an assistant professor in UCSB's Department of Geography, investigated how forests are responding to global warming and rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Since trees require CO2 and water to produce sugars and oxygen through photosynthesis, the latter effect is actually beneficial to forests, Trugman said. Trees don't require as much water, losing fewer water molecules per carbon molecule gained. ""[Higher atmospheric CO2] increases productivity and potentially could increase reproduction and ecosystem services. This has a lot of potential to result in negative feedback on climate change because trees are photosynthesizing more and they're pulling more carbon out of the atmosphere,""ù Trugman explained. However, other climate change aspects such as changes in temperature have detrimental effects on forests. Warming temperatures can increase the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, a measure of atmospheric dryness. In response, trees decrease their photosynthetic activity to conserve water. ""And so, the motivation of this study was looking at the competing effects of CO2 fertilization and warmer temperatures that cause more atmospheric dryness, and how they might impact future forests,""ù Trugman said. The study examined historic and future climate scenarios at 20 areas in four forested U.S. regions including the Pacific Northwest, Mountain West, Boreal and Southeast. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Working with researchers from the University of Utah, Trugman developed models to predict how future forests may respond to these opposing climate change influences. ""What's really interesting and particularly novel about this study is that it also looks at how trees can and whole forests can actually adapt to mitigate this stress,""ù she stated. For every molecule of CO2 that a tree obtains through its leaves, it loses water molecules. To reduce water demand at the individual level, trees can decrease leaf area to alleviate some stress from increased atmospheric dryness. Forests with fewer trees may have less mortality risk during dry events than forests with more trees due to less competition for the finite water supply, according to Trugman. The researchers thus represented potential forest or ecosystem-level adaptations in their models as water demand stability. In their models based on conditions from 20 continental U.S. forest locations, the collaborators used optimization theory, working with best-case scenario features to measure how well a tree can persist in current and future climates. For example, attributes included optimal leaf area and the maximum amount of carbon a tree can assimilate within a certain period. ""Basically, we wanted to make sure that the amount of biomass that was being supported wouldn't result in any mortality events due to water stress for scarce resources,""ù Trugman said. The forest models were simulated over a 30-year period with forecasted future weather until the year 2099. The scientists found that hotter futures resulted in less production of forest biomass due to mortality or not adjusting quickly enough. From the study, if forests did not adapt, 55% of the sampled climate projections would result in an increase in biomass. The rise of CO2 levels would be great enough to overcome ""significant drought and mortality""ù from warming in these scenarios, the paper stated. If forests acclimated, this percentage would rise to 71%. ""The results are really interesting in that it actually turns out to be the balance of how much warming we expect per degree of CO2 increase that really determines if we see a decreased productivity in forests in the future and increased mortality or increased productivity,""ù Trugman said. But she mentioned that at this point, it was not certain how future forests will respond. Based on the different climate conditions used in the paper, the simulated trees experienced different ratios of CO2 increase to temperature increase. Trugman brought up the ""potential""ù in pursuing study of possible shorter-term responses, including how forest responses might evolve over time and how rapidly adaptation may take place. ""I think there's a lot of potential to explore what might occur [there] and also what might occur if we try and go after some of these negative emissions scenarios that we might have to resort to given that we're not meeting the goals aided by the Paris Agreement currently.""ù

science,Womxn/Hacks Organizes Second Annual Hackathon Over Weekend,23-Jan-20,8:00 AM,['Surya Pugal'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/womxn-hacks-organizes-second-annual-hackathon-over-weekend/,"Over 250 students from around campus and across the country spent 36 hours at the Student Resource Building and Corwin Pavilion coding nonstop over the weekend at the second annual Womxn/Hacks, a hackathon at UC Santa Barbara dedicated to promoting an inclusive environment for female-identifying people interested in S.T.E.M. The second annual 36-hour hackathon organized by Womxn/Hacks took place from Jan. 17-19 in the Student Resource Building. The event provided an opportunity for female-identifying and non-binary students to create and present innovative or useful tech projects. / Courtesy of Surya Pugal The Womxn/Hacks officer team, which consisted of students from various majors and school years, spent months behind the scenes organizing the hackathon, an event spanning three days during which participants develop useful or innovative tech projects and then present these projects to a series of judges. According to Mina York, fourth-year sociology major and president of the officer board, Womxn/Hacks was spearheaded last year by Sarina Abrishamcar, president of the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and current advisor for WomxnHacks. Abrishamcar, along with several other AAUW officers, created Womxn/Hacks as a means of bridging the enduring gender gap within computer science. York largely attributed this disparity to stereotypes reinforced at an early age, asserting that ""boys are often raised building things, whereas girls are often raised playing with dolls and taking care of things.""ù York also pointed out that most middle school and high school S.T.E.M. teachers tend to be male, further exacerbating the effects of imposter syndrome for female students, as well as students who do not fit into the male-female binary. To better tackle the pressing inequity within computer science and S.T.E.M. at large, the officer board this year has doubled in size, consisting of 26 officers as well as five additional interns. Greater emphasis had also been placed on mental health, as displayed in the creation of the Hacker Experience board, a subset of the officer board focused on putting on events related to emotional well-being, such as stargazing and mason jar painting. These events served to break away from the competitive nature of hackathons and de-stress those who may be overwhelmed with pressure to create a working product. Kitty Fung, fourth-year computer science major and head of Hacker Experience, asserted that the ultimate goal for Womxn/Hacks was to ""provide a safe space for all female-identifying and non-binary students on campus to code together.""ù This sentiment was evidenced by the presence of several female-identifying keynote speakers and industry leaders, who helped reinforce the idea that ""empowered womxn empower womxn.""ù The hackathon hosted activities related to mental well-being, including mason jar painting, to provide the coders a break to de-stress. / Courtesy of Surya Pugal In an effort to increase inclusivity for students of all coding backgrounds, the hackathon also offered both beginner and advanced tracks for students to participate in. Several workshops were held throughout the hackathon to teach participants about iOS, Flask, web development and even quantum programming. Jayleen Li, a third-year computer science major and one of several mentors that assisted participants with their projects, pointed out that what makes hackathons enticing is this opportunity to ""learn about new technologies and even make new friends""ù in the process. This year's theme heavily focused on sustainability, which was reflected in both the various project submissions and high concentration of recyclable materials used in the hackathon. Winning submissions included ""Hua-lee""ù (Best Overall and Best Hardware Hack), a robot that can identify when and how to water a plant depending on its soil moisture content (developed by Jacqueline Burd, Swetha Pillai, Cher Lin and Tiffany Cowan), and ""Know Your Trash""ù (Best Sustainability Hack), a mobile app that when given a picture of an object, can determine if the object is trash or recycling (developed by Shamali Shinde, Aakanksha Patel, Anuja Patil and Tram Tran). Over $26,000 in prizes were awarded, including Microsoft Surfaces, Bose noise-cancelling headphones and Atari flashbacks. While the awards were certainly an incentive to participate, the biggest reward that hackathons provide is the pride that accompanies developing a project that you can get behind, as well as the sense of camaraderie among like-minded individuals that is hard to find anywhere else. The latter shows particularly in Womxn/Hacks, which continues to help foster a strong community of women in a male-dominated industry. April Sanchez, third-year computer science major and WomxnHacks participant, echoed this sentiment, arguing that ""events like these help promote more women joining tech and not be discouraged by naysayers.""ù Sanchez stated that by simply ""showing up, you'll find a welcoming community of womxn with whom to build ideas, get support from and have fun.""ù

science,The Strange Case of Parasitic Castrators Amongst Hermaphroditic Barnacles,23-Jan-20,2:00 PM,['Hannah Hirou'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/the-strange-case-of-parasitic-castrators-amongst-hermaphroditic-barncles/,"Parasitic castrators remain one of the most fascinating aspects of parasitology. These organisms feast on the lipid-rich reproductive tissues of their host, which results in eventual castration. Not a good day if you're a barnacle ""¶ or is it? Unlike other parasites, castrators tend to leave their host otherwise unaffected and in some cases even increase the longevity of the organism. ""All other kinds of parasites, in a certain sense, degrade their habitat and that means that host is more likely to die ""¶ there is only one kind of energy you can take from an organism that will not affect its viability, and that is its reproductive energy, and you can take it all,""ù explained Armand Kuris, a professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology and in the College of Creative Studies. Hemioniscus balani is a bit of an enigma. It is a parasitic isopod that, unlike most other castrators, has an ephemeral life cycle inside its host. After infecting its host, the parasite then dies. ""We don't understand that,""ù Kuris said. When it dies, the host usually regains its ability to reproduce ""î a very unusual case. Wanting to find out more about this mysterious parasite and its relationship to the barnacle Chthamalus fissus, Kuris, UCSB postdoctoral researcher Caitlin Fong and UC San Diego professor Ryan Hechinger studied hermaphroditic barnacles and the relationship between size-specific reproduction function and infection rates by H. balani. Since these barnacles are hermaphrodites, ""they function as either man or female most of the time, but they don't do both at the same time,""ù Kuris clarified. This means they can choose whether to devote energy to a male or female reproductive status. The study found that parasiticism infection of H. balani occurred at a higher rate in female-functioning barnacles. / Courtesy of iNaturalist The study, published in Scientific Reports, made the prediction that infection would be mainly in female-functioning barnacles due to the parasite's feeding habits. It was also speculated that increased body size would be correlated with increased infection rates in these female hosts. The researchers thought this could be for one of two reasons. The first was that larger size means a larger target for the parasitic isopod to encounter. The second idea was that the isopods themselves choose a larger host. To test their hypothesis, the study looked at two different populations at six different locations along the California coast, from Goleta down to La Jolla in San Diego. The two main factors at play when it came to this study were how the size of the barnacle affected the probability of its sex and how size then affected the probability of infection. ""Size primarily determined the probability of female reproduction, and secondarily, the probability of infection, since parasitism is only possible if the host has a female reproductive function,""ù Fong explained via email. The paper found that females were most likely to be of intermediate size while the males were more often the largest. Fong went on to state that ""the probability of infection was not even across sizes (i.e. no matter the size, your probability of infection was the same). Rather, the probability of infection matched the probability of female reproduction.""ù The other pivotal point in this study was the debate between the probability of encountering a host versus choosing a host. Interestingly, the data collected in the study found that the infection was not random among the different locations. ""Because the infection is non-random, something must be driving this pattern. The infectious stage is pretty mobile, so the choice seems likely,""ù Fong said. H. balani is actively able to move around in the last of three larval stages, its cryptoniscus-searching stage, and would be able to choose a larger host which would be more favorable for its fitness. This idea comes from another parasite of barnacles in the family Chthamalophilidae. These parasites infiltrate the brooding cavity of barnacles with a preference for a larger cavity size to maximize their own offspring output. A fundamental difference between these two cases is that H. balani has a much shorter life cycle, so it is difficult to say whether this comparison is apt. As a result, the behavior of H. balani remains a subject of further research.

There are sponges, spines, shells, scales and skeletons all hiding in the granular carpeting surrounding picturesque tropical atolls, and all of these pieces play a role as orators in recounting the grand history of the reef. One researcher at UC Santa Barbara, Erin Dillon, has been working since 2014 to document this history. In particular, she is looking at the dermal denticles of sharks, the tooth-like scales which cover shark skin, to better understand their population baselines and abundance in a number of contexts.† A scanning electron microscope image of a great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) denticle; scale bar = 20um / Photo Credit: Erin Dillon & Jorge Ceballos ""Anything that leaves calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate or anything that's not getting dissolved remains in the [coral reef] sediments as a record of what was there. It's just full of animal parts essentially,""ù said Dillon, a Ph.D. candidate in the Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department.† Dillon first encountered dermal denticles as an intern working at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. What was originally meant to be a three-month internship became a two-year project and led her to pursue further research into dermal denticles for her Ph.D. Her first paper evaluated what sort of information could be obtained from shark dermal denticles. Her most recent paper, published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, transitions from theory to practice.† Dermal denticles decrease drag and turbulence in the water for sharks. On a more pertinent note for Dillon, they are shed and regrown in a continuous cycle.† ""Even though sharks are relatively rare, these denticles are still preserving a signal of their presence. Any time a shark is visiting a reef or staying on a reef, it's possibly shedding these denticles and then they're accumulating,""ù Dillon said. ""We don't have very much quantitative information going back in time about what their historical baselines are ""¶ This essentially gives us a way to compare modern shark assemblages and then also go back in time to look at how they've changed over time ""¶ We're asking, how much natural variability was there historically? There are more recent human impacts versus just a fluctuation that is natural.""ù With her collaborators, most of whom are from UCSB, Dillon settled on Palmyra Atoll, one of the Northern Line Islands in the Central Pacific located south of the Hawaiian Islands, as a study site. According to Dillon, Palmyra was a perfect test run, being an island with high and well-surveyed shark populations.

This location was nice because it's pretty remote, it's protected. We know that the sharks are stable,""ù Dillon described.† A wide assortment of sharks call Palmyra Atoll home, with at least 15 species documented by cameras and shallow surveys. The study focused on two species in particular: blacktip reef sharks and grey sharks. During the study, Dillon evaluated the abundance of shed dermal denticles found in the sand and compared it to documented shark abundance using a variety of survey techniques, namely hook-and-line surveys, remote underwater video surveys and underwater visual censuses, or UVC. ""Those approaches are looking at sharks over slightly different time scales ranging from just a couple of minutes to over an hour,""ù Dillon said. ""Then we looked at these surveys and asked the question: Do these denticle accumulation rates actually reflect shark abundance? Because the denticle is our proxy. And so, if we haven't really assessed the fidelity of that proxy, it becomes hard to really use it and interpret the data.""ù With little exception, the researchers found that, indeed, when cross-referencing denticle accumulation rates in coral reef sediment with the results from actual observed shark surveys, there was consistently a correlation. ""The finding that there was a positive correlation with these three methods ""î despite them functioning on different trend scales and using different methods ""î is really promising,""ù Dillon stated. Even locations around Palmyra Atoll which did not follow this trend had explanations when they were held up to scrutiny. One example of this could be found in the results obtained from a sediment core which was located in a section of the Palmyran coast that appeared to only be accessible to sharks during high tide. ""And so we were thinking that the bait from the technique could have been attracting sharks that normally wouldn't have been in that habitat. It produced artificially high numbers for shark abundance compared to the denticle record,""ù Dillon said. It was often a case of where the site was positioned combined with the execution of surveying methods that would influence the behavior of the sharks during the surveillance period. Now, Dillon and her collaborators are planning to apply this promising technique to other areas of the globe in order to obtain better data on shark recovery targets and population management. ""For example, right now, we've been working with some samples from the Caribbean coast to Panama,""ù Dillon said. ""And using these denticles, we've been able to essentially reconstruct what a pre-human [population] baseline looks like in that area. So denticles are one example of applying the recent fossil record to management conservation issues.""ù

science,"‚""Two Years After Fire and Flood‚""ù: Santa Barbara Community Evaluates Impacts and Responses",30-Jan-20,8:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/two-years-after-fire-and-flood-santa-barbara-community-evaluates-impacts-and-responses/,"On Sunday, about 300 people filed into the Fleischmann Auditorium at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in attendance of a public conversation regarding the aftermath of the Thomas Fire in December 2017 and January 2018, and the Montecito mudflows which ensued following a deluge of rain which extinguished the fires on Jan. 8, 2018.† Sarah Anderson, an associate professor of environmental politics in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, gives a flash talk during the event. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus The event, organized by UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, the Santa Barbara Community Environmental Council (CEC), the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Santa Barbara Channelkeeper and the Santa Barbara Foundation, aimed to inform the public regarding ""ongoing research assessing the extent of [the] impacts""ù and ""how to improve response[s] to future disasters,""ù according to the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History's website.† In December 2017, severe dry conditions coupled with strong Santa Ana winds gave birth to an insatiable firestorm which spread and engulfed the southeastern bounds of Los Padres National Forest. The Thomas Fire burned 281,893 acres and at the time grew into the largest wildfire in California history ""î later surpassed by the Ranch Fire in 2018.†† Then came the first significant precipitation of the season. Four inches of rain fell in a single, torrential storm, thoroughly extinguishing the fires and resulting in cataclysmic debris flows, responsible for 23 deaths.† Now, two years later, the community reconvenes to reflect. The speakers who attended included Sarah Anderson, an associate professor of environmental politics in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management; Andrew Brooks, the project scientist with the UC Natural Reserve System monitoring the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve and Steven Gaines, the dean of the Bren School.† Alongside faculty were speakers with the Santa Barbara County Flood Control, Geosyntec Consultants, South Coast Habitat Restoration, Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the CEC. Particular focus was given to the progress in healing the areas around the debris flows over the past two years, with both promising signs of recovery as well as sobering realities regarding the damage to infrastructure and the natural environment which continues to persist today.† Brooks delved into the impacts that the mudflows had on the wetlands and salt marshes straddling the coast. Nearly 20,000 dumpsters' worth of debris flowed downstream from the burn scars and inundated the Carpinteria Salt Marshes. If put end to end in a single line, they would have stretched for 22 miles, according to Brooks.† Coupled with the fact that the salt marsh is a biodiversity hotspot of the South Coast with 250 plant species, 200 bird species and 150 marine fish species, the extensive damage to it particularly stings. ""Well, first, there was quite a bit of habitat loss. Oysters, crabs, shrimp, clams, they were completely buried and suffocated by the large amounts of sediment that now choke these channels. The loss of those species causes disruptions to the marsh food web, as many of the species that were lost are important food items for other species,""ù Brooks said. ""There was [also] actually the introduction of a number of toxic compounds associated with the burned chaparral material that washed into the marsh,""ù he continued. ""We were faced with sort of an existential question ""¶ What do we do? Do we clean everything up and try to restore the marsh back to its pre-reflow conditions? Or do we step back, monitor the conditions and work out how the systems respond?""ù Andrew Brooks, the project scientist with the UC Natural Reserve System monitoring the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, presented. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus† Brooks found many things promising, guiding the audience through photos of wetlands in recovery, making note of how the streams and tides have guided the rejuvenation of the land. However, Brooks was quick to qualify that although widespread recovery has occurred, much of the wetlands are still severely degraded, and stressed that moving forward, the preservation of existing wetlands and the prevention of further habitat fragmentation will be necessary to ensure the resilience and vitality of the marsh. ""We need to maintain the connectedness between those wetlands. A lot of the species that were extirpated by the debris flow [and the wetlands] are going to be colonized by individuals and species that are found in other marshes up and down the coast,""ù Brooks said. ""If those marshes go away, we no longer have a source for those species to be colonized from.""ù Brandon Steets, a senior principal engineer with Geosyntec Consultants, discussed the microbial impacts on coastal water quality that the fires, subsequent debris flows and dumping had in the Santa Barbara Channel.† Goleta Beach, closed to beachgoers for six months following the debris flows and the dumping of debris onto the beach, which was carried out afterward, showed elevated levels of surfzone bacteria throughout sampling. However, in the months during the closure, the decline in bacteria levels continued steadfastly and improved below state standards in July, a benchmark which was met earlier than expected.† Geosyntec Consultants, the engineering firm hired to evaluate the surfzone off of Goleta Beach following debris dumping, had three questions to answer in its continuous testing of the water for bacteria and human markers. ""First, is it the sand on the beach that's causing what's happening in the water? ""¶ Second, what is the spatial extent of the elevated bacteria? ""¶ And third, is human waste present? This is the most important question because if human waste is present, then the gastrointestinal illness risk to those exposed [to the water] is going to be higher,""ù Steets said.† ""The state standards are predicated on the assumption that human waste is present. If it's not present, that illness's risks are much lower than you would think based on that bacteria's magnitude.""ù Steets and his team found that the elevated levels of bacteria were highest at the disposal area. These levels fell in samples obtained at sites further away from the disposal area. Furthermore, it was confirmed that elevated bacteria found in the surfzone was coming from bacteria in the sand and sediment.† In looking at the human marker results, Geosyntec Consultants concluded that ""there was no evidence of human waste in surfzone water, and therefore no evidence of an elevated human risk.""ù For the future, Steets recommends that disposal activities should be surveilled in the same way, with an emphasis on ""monitoring indicator bacteria, human DNA marker and potentially pathogens in the raw material and the surf zone during and after disposal.""ù Presenters including UCSB NCEAS's Kim Selkoe, Santa Barbara Channelkeeper's Ben Pitterle and Santa Barbara County Flood Control's Tom Fayram spoke on the latest ongoing research assessing the impacts of the Thomas fire and mudslides and how it might inform future disaster responses. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus In describing impacts to people, Anderson described a number of ways in which residents of Santa Barbara had responded more effectively to difficulties associated with the fire and subsequent mudflows than other communities had done in the wake of similar natural disasters.† ""I was worried about [after the fire] because my research has shown that as time passes, the degree to which you're paying attention to [risk] falls off. And at the same time ""î in the case of wildfires ""î that risk is actually increasing as vegetation grows.""ù Anderson pointed to a risk-curve graph with two lines moving opposite one another, one declining and one increasing, demonstrating the decline in salience as time after a natural disaster grows longer.† ""There's a mismatch between our attention and what's going on and in the national system. [We] looked across the western United States. Imagine one city that didn't have [a] wildfire, and a second city that had had a wildfire. We found that in the second city, the city that had a wildfire was actually more likely to get government [aid for fire prevention]. And if you think about it, that city actually probably has lower fire risk,""ù Anderson stated.† Anderson listed a few factors which separate Santa Barbara residents from other vulnerable communities, namely knowledge and wealth.† Cited were the results from a survey which evaluated whether or not participants correctly answered questions inquiring about the ""most-likely scenario for a debris flow to occur, the number of houses that can be destroyed by a debris flow, the largest boulders that can be carried by a debris flow, the fastest speed of a debris flow and the largest size of a debris flow.""ù It was found that a significant ""î and sometimes overwhelming ""î majority of participants managed to answer the question correctly. However, there was another explanation for Santa Barbara's reduced wildfire risk in addition to knowledge. Wealth and privilege were also statistically significant variables.† ""If we go back to these two communities ""¶ I told you that the one that has a wildfire is more likely to have gotten government funds. And it turns out that with whiter, wealthier or more educated communities that gap is even bigger. So there's also a story here about inequality,""ù Anderson said. Perhaps given that ""î as Anderson suggests ""î it would be wise to use Santa Barbara's resources to aid in the recovery of other surrounding communities.† A survey conducted during the final minutes of the discussion before the floor was opened for questions, asked the attendees to describe Santa Barbara in one word. The safer ""resilient""ù only won the second place spot. ""Resilient,""ù in fact, was sandwiched between two different, more complicated distinctions: ""affluent""ù and ""entitled.""ù ""We're surrounded by communities who share our wildfire and debris flow risks, and I think it's imperative that we share our story so that those communities can learn from what we've done,""ù Anderson said.† ""And so our story is powerful not just to this conversation, but it's powerful to other folks and I challenge everyone in this room to take our story out beyond the walls of this conversation.""ù

science,Neuroscientists Find Categorization Influences May Begin in Earliest Stages of Visual System,30-Jan-20,8:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/neuroscientists-find-categorization-influences-may-begin-in-earliest-stages-of-visual-system/,"Whether it is distinguishing between edible and poisonous plants that look similar or separating trash from recyclables, categorization has always been an important ability for humans. Learning which items belong to what category based on basic visual features increases our perceptual sensitivity. That is, differences between physically similar but categorically distinct objects become enhanced; correspondingly, differences between physically similar objects in the same category become reduced. Neuroscientists, including Thomas Sprague, Edward Ester and John Serences, suspected these biases may be based in the brain's occipitoparietal cortex, an area which helps us integrate information from our environment as detected through our senses, including vision. To test this hypothesis and get a better idea of how people learn to categorize information in the world around them, the researchers carried out three experiments. Their findings are detailed in a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Through trial and error, the study's participants learned to associate stimuli with specific category labels ""very quickly ""¶ within five to 10 minutes of practice,""ù said Sprague, an assistant professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and a faculty member in the Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Dynamical Neuroscience (DYNS). The participants were trained to associate bars in various orientations ""î clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to a randomly selected stimulus orientation on a computer monitor ""î as belonging to one of two arbitrary categories. ""What we then wanted to do was see if that learning actually changes how the visual system is processing information,""ù said Ester, lead author of the study and an assistant professor in Florida Atlantic University's Department of Psychology. The researchers tested categorization based on object orientation and spatial location using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures brain activity in different brain regions. They complemented this method with another commonly used technique, electroencephalogram (EEG). Providing better temporal specificity than fMRI, EEG could show how quickly the categorized neural representations emerged. ""That tells us what different stages of processing might be influenced,""ù Ester explained. The results appeared to indicate that the effects of categorization were ""basically immediate,""ù according to Sprague. ""As soon as you're engaged in a task and sensory input comes, it's already assigned a category and this impacts the neural representation,""ù he said. The scientists also performed other experiments to ensure that their findings were based on categorization and not due to alternative explanations, such as motor planning or response selection. A: In experiment 1, participants viewed iso-oriented bars assigned one of 15 unique orientations from 0∞ to 168∞ in each trial. B: The researchers designated two arbitrary catgories by randomly choosing a stimulus orientation as a category boundary and assigning the seven orientations counterclockwise to Category 1 and the seven orientations clockwise to Category 2. Courtesy of Edward Ester Additionally, they modeled the brain responses of various neural populations to see how visual orientations activate different brain regions. Using the patterns of brain activity, the models generated neural representations of the stimuli subjects were viewing, allowing the researchers to decode or predict what subjects were looking at in a given trial. The brain activity patterns that emerged differed based on the orientation of the stimuli. ""Our central question was does learning how to categorize these stimuli or does the intent to try and place them in different categories actually influence those patterns of activity such that stimuli that are from the same category become more similar to one another?""ù Ester described. Indeed, the collaborators found that, as a group, brain activity patterns evoked by stimuli from the same category appeared more similar to one another. They became more distinct than patterns of activity prompted by stimuli from the other category. Furthermore, the study reports that the generated representations appeared more like an exemplar or prototype from a category rather than the actual physical stimulus itself. This suggests that in categorizing a stimulus, relatively early visual areas begin to process it in a way that corresponds more to its category membership instead of its physical attributes. ""That's something that's relatively surprising, because it's long been thought that the visual system is a label-blind system that responds in very specific ways to certain types of stimuli,""ù Ester said. ""And those types of responses are immutable. They're not really selective or they can't really be changed by intent ""î but we find that they, in fact, can.""ù The representations also correlated with participants' categorization performance. A stronger effect in the biasing of stimuli or change in activity pattern arose when participants correctly categorized the stimuli than when they didn't. The paper provides insight into how categorizing processes may influence information processing at the earliest stages of the visual system in the occipitoparietal cortex. ""Maybe the most important finding from this study is it provides some intriguing insights into a debate about whether categorical decision making is something that happens kind of at an abstract level, say, [in the later stages of the visual processing system such as in the] parietal cortex or frontal cortex, where you're reasoning about vertical sensory information,""ù Sprague stated. ""This is saying, ""òWell, actually, there's information in as early as the primary sensory cortex that is already fundamentally different based on a very rapidly learned arbitrary category.'""ù ""It really gives us a window into how previous knowledge and learning can actually shape ongoing visual processing and do so in a way that's helpful or optimal, that helps you to solve a particular problem or perform a particular task,""ù Ester added. Ester is next interested in ""really trying to drill down and understand the different types of changes in the brain that are happening when you look at category effects.""ù He hopes to do this by examining categorical effects at the levels of individual neurons or small populations of neurons. ""Right now what we're measuring is, in many ways, a very abstract picture on how the brain might be processing information,""ù Ester said. ""What we'd ideally like to do is adopt a more reductionist approach and get a better, higher-resolution picture on the types of changes that are happening in the brain when people learn to categorize this information.""ù The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and a James S. McDonnell Foundation grant awarded to Serences.

science,"Former UCSB Professor Faces Paper Retractions, Suspicions Regarding Anomalous Data",6-Feb-20,7:30 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/former-ucsb-professor-faces-paper-retractions-suspicions-regarding-anomalous-data/,"Jonathan Pruitt, a former UCSB professor currently working at McMaster University, finds himself engrossed in a whirlwind of controversy following the retraction of four academic research papers and an ongoing investigation by numerous peers into his extensive body of work. Anomalies identified in data collected by Pruitt have put the status of his research publications in jeopardy. The proceedings of these investigations are currently being compiled in a Google Sheets document created by Daniel Bolnick, the editor in chief of the American Naturalist and a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut ""î as well as a one-time co-author, collaborator and friend of Pruitt's. Pruitt worked with UCSB's Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB) department until October 2018, when he left the United States for McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario after being offered an annual seven-year $350,000 research grant by the Canadian government. At McMaster, Pruitt has been involved in animal personality research, managing his own lab and studying animal behavior in various species. As a holder of one of Canada's 150 prestigious Research Chairs, Pruitt had been lauded as a standout in the field. Issues with Pruitt's data were first brought to attention by Niels Dingemanse, a professor of behavioral ecology at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, regarding the paper ""Individual and Group Performance Suffers from Social Niche Disruption,""ù published in The American Naturalist. The paper has since been retracted. ""[Dingemanse's] critique (from an analysis by Erik Postma) identified biologically implausible patterns in the data file used in the paper (Laskowski et al 2016). Specifically, certain numbers appeared far more often than one would expect from any plausible probability distribution,""ù Bolnick wrote in a post on his blog, Eco-Evo Evo-Eco. Kate Laskowski, a professor in the department of evolution and ecology at UC Davis who collaborated with Pruitt on four papers in the research of social spiders ""î two of which have since been retracted, with a third in the process of being retracted ""î was made aware of the issues with Pruitt's data by Dingemanse and contacted Pruitt. The data in question measured the ""boldness""ù behavior of specific social spiders, or the ""latency of the spiders to resume movement after being scared,""ù Laskowski wrote in a blog post. According to Laskowski, the prediction was that the ""repeatability of behavior""ù would increase in mixed colonies with ""increasing tenure with their groups,""ù supporting the notion that interactions with the same group of individuals repeatedly will ""canalize""ù individuals into behaving in predictable ways. In other words, spiders over time will fall into particular social niches. Pruitt, a former UCSB professor, has recently had four of his research papers retracted from scientific journals for anomalies in data. His other publications are also currently under investigation. / Courtesy of McMaster University ""Jonathan had [made measurements] to two decimal places, to the hundredth of a second. He said he did this with a stopwatch,""ù Laskowski said in an interview with the Nexus. ""However, there were many values that were duplicated, like exactly down to two decimal places. And so this seems really weird, right? How can two spiders get the exact same time down to a hundredth of a second?""ù Pruitt clarified to Laskowski that the reason for this was that the spiders were actually measured in a block design, with multiple spiders simultaneously being observed and followed using the same stopwatch, and ""then if two spiders did something at the same time, they recorded the same time,""ù according to Laskowski. ""To be very honest, I was a little bit frustrated because he hadn't previously told me this is how he collected the data. This is a paper that I had my name on, and the fact that I didn't understand this part about the data collection was frustrating, but these to me seemed like honest mistakes.""ù According to Laskowski, Pruitt resolved to publish a correction to the paper. However, Laskowski found more and more anomalies in the data as her examination of the duplicate values proceeded further. ""I thought, if I could figure out what block the spiders were measured in, I could account for this statistically and that would recover some of the power of our analysis,""ù Laskowski explained. ""So I started looking at the data, trying to find out what blocks spiders were measured in it with the assumption that all of these duplicate values should be occurring in the same observation, like we had multiple observations per animal.""ù However, to Laskowski's dismay, these duplicate values were not occuring in the same observations, but instead in measurements with the same animal which were supposedly five weeks apart from one another. ""These duplicate values, that pattern of duplication ""î it cannot be explained by block design at all,""ù Laskowski stated. ""The other co-author on the paper, [Pierre-Olivier] Montiglio, and I talked extensively about what I had found, and he and I both agreed, since we couldn't figure out what was causing the problems in the data, we couldn't correct it, and this meant that any of the results from our paper were invalid,""ù Laskowski wrote in her post. Laskowski contacted Bolnick, requesting a retraction. As further investigations continue to unveil issues with Pruitt's data, Pruitt himself is still engaged in ongoing research, working in the South Pacific and Australia on field research. While the ultimate consequences are as of yet unknown, the investigations into Pruitt's data will no doubt have an enormous impact on Pruitt, his collaborators and the broader field of animal personality research. ""Whether the problem is data handling error or intentional manipulation, the outcome will be both a series of retractions (the two public ones are just the beginning I fear), and mistrust of unretracted papers,""ù Bolnick wrote. ""This is harmful to the field, and harmful especially to the authors and co-authors on those papers. Many of them (myself included) were involved in Pruitt-authored papers on the basis of lively conversations generating ideas that he turned into exciting articles,""ù Bolnick continued. While the ordeal is no doubt difficult, how the retractions have been handled is a matter of less controversy than the retractions themselves. ""I think the right course of action going forward is happening. And that we're now doing it collectively as a community. We have lots of data forensics, people and other researchers who are completely uninvolved, and so hopefully have no conflicts of interest,""ù Laskowski said. ""All of us together are now trying to go through all of the data that Jonathan has provided in his papers to see which datasets appear like they might have some problems that need to be investigated.""ù When asked for comment, Director of News and Media Relations at UCSB Andrea Estrada wrote in an email to the Nexus that the university is aware of the allegations, but ""cannot discuss specific cases.""ù Furthermore, ""maintaining the highest degree of integrity in all research endeavors is essential to our mission.""ù ""We have robust procedures on our campus to address instances of research misconduct, and we would cooperate with any other institution conducting an investigation.""ù Meanwhile, those hoping to read about Pruitt's UCSB research on The Current will find themselves redirected to a blank page.

science,New English Course at UCSB Offers Students a More Personal Understanding of Climate Change,6-Feb-20,8:00 AM,['Daniel Seo'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/new-english-course-at-ucsb-offers-students-a-more-personal-understanding-of-climate-change/,"To some, it's not a significant issue. To others, it's simply a hoax. To many, the climate crisis is more than a mere dilemma; it is a devastating catastrophe that is causing our planet to deteriorate day by day. Although recent environmental issues such as the disastrous fires in Australia and the widespread melting of snow and land ice continue to worsen, many are still unaware of the true destructive impacts that climate change brings to our planet. Ken Hiltner, professor of environmental humanities at UC Santa Barbara, decided to take action. Climate change can intensify natural disasters. In January 2020, Fire Captain Dave Soldavini held a baby kangaroo rescued from the Australian wildfires. Courtesy of WIkimedia Commons In the fall of 2018, Hiltner proposed a new class to address this issue to the Department of English, which later became accepted for Winter Quarter 2020. The course would be called English 23, or ""The Climate Crisis: What It Is and What Each of Us Can Do About It,""ù known colloquially as Climate Crisis 101. One of the major objectives of this course is helping students understand the root causes of anthropogenic climate change and how our harmful actions against the planet have developed over time. The course also looks through the scope of environmental humanities to analyze the cultural construction of our actions and why we do what we do, even when these very actions are destroying our home. ""I wish for students to have a better understanding of the climate crisis and have people realize its range of [effects], such as fires, hurricanes and potential wars,""ù Hiltner said about his goal for the course. ""Many people perceive it as a far-off thing, but I want them to not feel overwhelmed or petrified, but rather energized into action.""ù In addition to focusing on what the climate crisis is about, Hiltner also emphasizes the importance of taking a stance and acting upon solutions against the crisis, stating that only together can we fight to mitigate this issue. ""My vision [for this class] is that there would be significant cultural changes in response to it. When we go to downtown Santa Barbara, we see many plant-based restaurants, and many people are using bikes instead of cars. My hope is that students leaving here will not act the exact same way past generations had done, but instead live a simpler and environmentally friendly way.""ù Since Hiltner argues that the climate crisis is a global issue and thus a collective effort, he teaches the course in a discussion-based manner, where students are actively engaged in educational discourse by discussing through YouTube comments. With this particular style, students are constantly sharing their thoughts and ideas about the crisis and possible solutions to it. When asked what inspired him to teach the course with this unique approach, Hiltner explains that he ""became really fascinated with online technology and the culture generally.""ù ""I thought it would be interesting if we could use GauchoSpace and YouTube, as it is robust and can be public for everyone,""ù Hiltner said. Students in the course have also reacted positively to Hiltner's method of teaching and the course's discussion-based approach. ""The assignments of writing commentary on readings and viewings promote vocal outreach and much is learned from each other's arguments, which we discuss during lecture,""ù Rayelyn Mallari, a first-year pre-biology major, stated. Mallari added that although there is an overall negative discussion about climate change, this course turns the table on the issue and persuades students to take aggressive action against the crisis. ""A large part of my life is dedicated to doing my part to try and combat the climate crisis, and this course has driven me to continue fighting,""ù Dania De Ramon, a first-year pre-communication major, added. Even beyond Santa Barbara, Hiltner emphasizes that people must become aware of the devastating impacts of the crisis and understand that we cannot take our planet for granted. ""If [people] don't care [about the crisis], then they need to learn more about it. [We] must look at it with open eyes, and it's important not to be overwhelmed by it. This is a manageable issue, but we need to jump right in with it right now,""ù Hiltner said. ""Don't do it like my generation, where we knew this would happen decades ago, yet we did not act on it. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury anymore to wait.""ù

His hour-long discussion of the study, including its results and its implications, attracted many avid ""birders,""ù environmentalists and concerned citizens.† The Santa Barbara Audubon Society, who partnered with UC Santa Barbara's Arts & Lectures program to make the event possible, sat in the center of the auditorium and made their passion for birds known by whistling in agreement during the lecture.†† After introducing himself, Rosenberg spoke of the methodology employed during the study to count the decreasing bird population. He and his 10 co-authors, coming from eight different institutions, relied heavily on volunteer data from what Rosenberg calls ""citizen scientists.""ù These ""citizen scientists""ù have been counting birds as a pastime for years and have been recording their observations in an online database. This database, also known as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) brings together the observations of millions of bird-loving citizens from across the United States and Canada. It was the perfect place to start for Rosenberg and his team. Along with the help of dozens of volunteers, they searched BBS for relevant data and entered it into a highly specific statistical model that accounted for variability and factors such as bird migration patterns. According to Rosenberg, the idea that bird populations are declining is not a new idea in itself, but the results of his study still shocked him. Rosenberg expected the decrease in some bird populations to be evened out by an increase in urban bird populations. What he and his team found, however, was that bird populations in North America have decreased by almost 2.9 billion since 1970.† ""The results were both staggering and sobering,""ù explained Rosenberg.† To confirm that the results were in fact accurate, Rosenberg and his team looked to radar ornithology, a new and innovative technique of recording bird migration patterns by analyzing weather radar data. Sure enough, major weather radars all reported a progressive decrease in bird biomass migrating since 2007.† Courtesy of Cornell Lab of Ornithology Shocked by their findings, Rosenberg and his team published their study ""Decline of the North American avifauna""ù in the journal Science in October of 2019. The study quickly generated much press, soon becoming the 209th of all 14,144,161 research outputs ever published with the largest audience reached, an impressive feat for such a recent study. Responses were emotional, according to Rosenberg. Concerned readers wrote letters to the editors, and ""birder""ù communities sought ways to help restore the bird population. They all wondered if something could still be done. Rosenberg addressed this issue in his lecture and explained that while the study results were alarming because they indicate the possibility of extinction for over 300 species of birds, it is in no way a death sentence.† ""Are there any reasons for hope?,""ù asked Rosenberg. ""The answer is yes. Bird populations are resilient, the most famous example being the return of the bald eagle once the pesticide DDT was banned. The bald eagle that was nearly extinct has rebounded tremendously.""ù Rosenberg advocates for a simple seven-action plan as well as more research on the reasons causing bird population decline. He spoke of the importance of bird-safe windows and the Bird-Safe Windows Buildings Act, legislation requiring all federally funded buildings to be built using bird-friendly windows.† He also mentioned buying Smithsonian-certified ""Bird Friendly""ù coffee, a type of coffee that can grow in the shade of tropical rainforests, preventing the unnecessary cutting down of rainforests. Though not very well-known, Bird Friendly coffee is a valid environmentally friendly option for the many coffee addicts roaming around campus and can be found at the Isla Vista Food Co-op. Other options include keeping cats indoors (or allowing them to go outside in specially built ""catios""ù), although one attendee vehemently disagreed during the Q&A session. Other ways to help are outlined on the study's website: 3billionbirds.org. The website includes pre-made social media posts complete with the hashtag #BringBirdsBack as well as an infographic outlining the seven simple actions that Rosenberg advocates.†† Most importantly, Rosenberg mentioned the worth of researching politicians' views on environmental legislation, especially with the upcoming presidential elections. According to Rosenberg, more legislation should be passed to protect both migrating birds and the environment.† ""[The results of this study] should make us mad,""ù said Rosenberg. ""Yes, it does!,""ù responded an enthusiastic audience member.†

science,"UCSB Researchers Develop Controlled Phage Therapy Techniques, Potential Alternative to Antibiotics",13-Feb-20,8:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/ucsb-researchers-develop-controlled-phage-therapy-techniques-potential-alternative-to-antibiotics/,"A growing concern in health care, antibiotic resistance weakens our ability to treat common infectious diseases. With antibiotics becoming less effective, researchers are looking into possible alternative treatment methods, including phage therapy. Bacteriophages, or phages for short, are viruses that hijack bacterial cells to reproduce. Phage therapy uses phages to fight bacterial infections. Its main appeal is its potential to work on organisms resistant to antibiotics. However, concerns regarding phage therapy stem from it being a poorly controlled technique, with an incomplete characterization of phage biology. Risks from phage evolution or its exponential replication create apprehension about its biocontrol, for instance. Popular in former republics of the Soviet Union, phage therapy is viewed generally as a last-resort option. Treatment is not available in the United States, though clinical interest is increasing with North America's first phage therapy center having opened at UC San Diego in 2019. ""Despite these problems, people have been turning to phage therapy in extreme situations. Our work is geared toward bringing phage therapy under control so that it can be used safely and more widely,""ù Irene Chen, an associate professor in UC Santa Barbara's department of chemistry and biochemistry, wrote in an email. The study's results appear in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Chen and her team aimed to address phage therapy issues by conjugating the phages to gold nanorods (AuNRs), creating ""phanorods.""ù They worked with UCSB mechanical engineering professor Beth Pruitt and her lab, who provided the proof of concept on the selectivity of phage therapy to target bacterial cells without killing non-harmful cells. ""[W]e were delighted to be part of testing this new exciting technology for the selective killing of bacteria while preserving mammalian cell health in culture,""ù Pruitt said via email. ""This preliminary work supports the idea of using such an approach in a wound healing environment to safely stamp out bacterial infections [with] little or no toxicity to the healing tissue.""ù UCSB researchers conjugated phages to gold nanorods to allow for more selective targeting in killing bacterial cells without harming non-targeted cells. Here, phanorods infect a cell. Courtesy of Huan Peng The phanorods were engineered to carefully target certain Gram-negative bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa and V. cholerae which infect humans, and X. campestris, which infects plants. By exciting the AuNRs with near-infrared light, the researchers could locally generate heat to efficiently and selectively kill bacterial cells and the phages themselves, quelling any undesired future phage evolutions or replications. ""When the nanorods are exposed to certain wavelengths of light, they absorb the light and convert the energy to heat (the photothermal effect). This leads to very high local temperatures around the phanorods, which essentially cooks the bacteria as well as the phage, while leaving non-targeted cells alive,""ù Chen explained. Huan Peng, a postdoctoral fellow in Chen's lab, stumbled upon the idea to use AuNRs in phage therapy. ""We were actually initially looking for a quick assay to check the binding of some engineered phages to bacteria,""ù Chen recalled. The photothermal effect of AuNRs has been used in nanomedicine techniques to treat cancer, as according to Chen, ""that was the genesis of the idea to use the AuNRs to specifically kill bacteria. We then realized that this method would have important advantages over other phage therapy approaches.""ù To test the potential of these phanorods further, the researchers applied them to a P. aeruginosa biofilm. Biofilms consist of a dense buildup of bacterial cells. They present a crucial problem in treating bacterial infections due to their greater resistivity to penetration by antibiotics. The assemblage of cells provides an advantage as even after being subjected to antibiotics, more cells can survive than if they were individually exposed to antibiotics. Chen and her collaborators showed extensive bacterial cell death in the biofilm as a result of the phonorods. They additionally tested how well the phanorods could kill bacterial cells without harming surrounding mammalian cells by using them on a P. aeruginosa biofilm growing directly on top of canine kidney cells. Once again, the scientists were able to demonstrate widespread bacterial cell death along with survival of the majority of kidney cells (84%). ""Showing that biofilms can be destroyed by the phanorods suggests that phanorods might work in physical scenarios when antibiotics might not,""ù Chen said. The next major step is to study phage therapy in more realistic models of bacterial infections, according to Chen. ""In addition, it is important for us to expand the number of microbes that we can target.""ù ""Right now there are many reasonable hesitations about phage therapy stemming from the lack of control over these biological entities. We believe that controlling phage therapy in this way could allow phages to become an acceptable therapy for use in antibiotic-resistant infections,""ù Chen said.

science,Molecular Engineering of Materials for Chemical Sensing and Metal-Organic Frameworks,13-Feb-20,2:00 PM,['Surya Pugal'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/molecular-engineering-of-materials-for-chemical-sensing-and-metal-organic-frameworks/,"Last week, Katherine Mirica, an assistant professor of chemistry at Dartmouth College, held a seminar at UC Santa Barbara about molecular engineering of materials for chemical sensing and microelectronics. Last week, Dartmouth College assistant professor of chemistry Katherine Mirica gave a seminar at UCSB about strategies for molecular engineering of stimuli-responsive multifunctional materials. Surya Pugal / Daily Nexus Students from the chemistry and biochemistry department attended the seminar which was hosted by Javier Read de Alaniz, a chemistry and biochemistry associate professor and associate director of the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI). The seminar was one of many offered in the Winter 2020 Colloquium Series from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Mirica briefly discussed her academic background and upbringing. She was born in Ukraine and later moved to the U.S., where she obtained her undergraduate degree at Boston College and her Ph.D. at Harvard University. Following this, she served as a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for over three years, after which she became a member of faculty at Dartmouth. Currently, Mirica heads a research group whose main focus is ""working with different realms of materials to try and find overarching emerging common properties.""ù The researchers are able to accomplish this through three research thrusts: using multifunctional materials for electroanalysis (a process by which potential or current is measured through an electrochemical cell containing an analyte, or substance of interest), utilizing molecular solids as a temporary adhesive and examining electroactive materials. During the seminar, Mirica focused on specific advancements she and her group made in the first two thrusts. With regards to the first thrust, the group studied a special class of materials known as conductive two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). They noticed that many of the core aspects of these materials were still unknown, and thus, ""many opportunities for fundamental science were available to pursue.""ù As a result of this, the group was able to develop highly sensitive MOF-based sensors that could detect small concentrations (subparts per billion) of gaseous analytes such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and nitric oxide in the presence of water. Mirica underscored the implications of such research, stating that ""designing new materials to detect certain gases would change the way we view these gases,""ù specifically within the pharmaceutical industry. Mirica also discussed the creation of self-organized frameworks on textiles (S.O.F.T. devices) and their effectiveness in the detection of gases. Even in the presence of increased heating, application of detergent and other pervasions, S.O.F.T. devices maintained high conductivity and flexibility. S.O.F.T. devices also provide a means to successfully capture and filter these gases. Hence, Mirica elucidated how they are particularly applicable in the creation of thin layers of protective equipment such as gas masks, alerting wearers if harmful chemicals, even in small concentrations, are penetrating said equipment. These devices also have implications in the development of portable electroanalytical systems and smaller wearable devices, as large carbon-based electrodes can be scaled down and advanced with ""novel materials and processes.""ù Nearing the end of the seminar, Mirica briefly discussed Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors on a microchip roughly doubles every two years. As more transistors are packed into a given unit of space, the size of these transistors gets smaller. However, Moore hypothesized that at some point in time, we would eventually hit a wall in the number of transistors we can cram into a microchip. Mirica states that now, we should ""build circuits as we do skyscrapers""ù and pursue a three-dimensional approach in design, something which seems to be working as the tech industry is getting better at packing more layers into a device. However, one of the constraints that the industry faces lies in the adhesives they use. As a result, Mirica and her group investigated the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as sublimable adhesives, adhesives which are rapidly removable through sublimation but maintain their adhesive properties in their solid state. She then examined other molecular solids and found that camphor had high success ""in the realm of temporary adhesion,""ù which she states is ideal for bonding bumpy structures prevalent within the semiconductor industry. Despite making several breakthroughs within chemistry, Mirica and her team are nowhere near done. She is continuing to pursue her research in the hope that she can help develop more ""robust energy devices""ù in a multitude of different fields and industries.

science,Inherited Cancer and Genetics: Mary-Claire King Describes Finding Cancer Susceptibility Gene BRCA1,14-Feb-20,9:00 AM,['Phoenix Pham'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-14/inherited-cancer-and-genetics-mary-claire-king-describes-finding-cancer-susceptibility-gene-brca1/,"Due to her dedicated effort, Mary-Claire King has shaped the way the science community views ovarian and breast cancer.† King described her discovery of the cancer susceptibility gene Breast Cancer-1 gene (BRCA1) and how it furthered understanding of hereditary ovarian and breast cancer risks. Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus King is the American Cancer Society Professor of Genome Sciences and of Medical Genetics in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington. Last Thursday night, King gave a lecture about her discovery at Campbell Hall, describing the process of finding the cancer susceptibility gene Breast Cancer-1 gene (BRCA1). The free public event was made possible by the Cancer Foundation of Santa Barbara and UCSB Arts & Lectures. In her lecture, King described the procedure of how she mapped BCRA1. Carrying out research from 1974 to 1990 to find a genetic marker that coincided with inheritable breast cancer, King described this journey as a ""15-year-long competition""ù among many scientists.† It was a difficult process to map out a gene, considering the Human Genome project ""î a 13-year international program that began in 1990 and aimed to identify and map out all the genes of human DNA ""î was not as comprehensive as it is now, and the lack of knowledge on the human genome caused difficulty in mapping genes.† King's breakthrough proved that breast cancer is heritable. Her identification of the BRCA1 mutation as a large factor in breast cancer susceptibility pioneered the marked expansion on how heredity risks work in breast and ovarian cancers as well as the advance of new preventive and therapeutic treatments.† King was the first person to discover the mutation of BRCA1 gene. Since gene mutation is linked to the removal of DNA base pairs, the translation of RNA to DNA and to production of the BRCA1 protein is disrupted.† Furthermore, the mutation could cause the loss of enzymes, which administers the breakdown of BRCA1 proteins. This loss of enzyme activity damages estrogen production, causing an imbalance of this hormone and thus increases risk of breast cancer. Additionally, the mutated cells are still able to persist, potentially turning into cancerous cells.† A notable study King conducted involved analyzing the risk of women developing cancer associated with having BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population pool in Israel. Approximately 8,000 healthy adult men were asked to join a genetic study. King explained that her participants were all men because breast cancer in men is very rare and could be a gateway to identifying BRCA female carriers that are related to them.† After distinguishing the male carriers, King tracked their family tree as far back as she could and offered free cancer screenings to all their female relatives. The result of the study was that 80% of BRCA1 female carriers developed cancers while 60% of BRCA2 female carriers developed cancers.† Through this study, King encouraged all adult women to make ""informed decisions""ù and understand that ""modern technology is capable of intensive monitoring and developing preventive protocols to reduce your [cancer] risks.""ù A remarkable treatment that King helped develop for heritable cancer (including breast and ovarian) is the use of PARP inhibitor therapy, a therapy that kills cancer cells by disrupting the DNA repair process of mutated BRCA1 gene. It is a natural incident for a non-mutated DNA to be damaged multiple times through a cell cycle since our body has two pathways to repair the damage: the primary homologous recombination pathway or the secondary AR-E1 pathway (less efficient, with the help of PARP1 protein).† In cancer cells, the gene mutation causes homologous repair to stop working, hence AR-E1 is the only pathway left to repair DNA. The PARP1 inhibitor will impede the AR-E1 pathway, eventually leading to the death of cancer cells, which grows at a substantial rate compared to normal cells. Patients that are given PARP1 inhibitor therapy saw a 70% slowed growth in cancer progression or cell deaths, according to King.† One of the reasons for the development of breast and ovarian cancer is the human ability to stay fertile longer compared to other mammal species, so one could greatly reduce their risks by removing ovarian and fallopian tubes, King stated.† She also described numerous non-genetic risks of developing breast/ovarian cancers among women, such as having an earlier first menstrual cycle and having a first child at an older age. Towards the end of the lecture, King expressed concerns over the challenge of identifying women who are at risk. The reason is, she explained, roughly 50% of BRCA1 and BRCA2† carriers have no close family history. On top of that, there are many more genes contributing to the development of breast/ovarian cancer and BRCA1 and BRCA2 are not the only cause. King suggested the best way to counter this problem is for ""every woman [to] get [their] annual mammogram and breast MRI screening""ù or to ask their doctor to screen for mutations. She also included that if BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers are identified, there are several protective measures from breast/ovarian cancers that they could take, such as the option to have a risk-reducing mastectomy or breast removal.† King ended the presentation with common trends about inherited cancer, giving us insights on her work. The themes were:† And last but not least, Dr. King wanted her audience to know that breast and ovarian cancer patients do not have to suffer or die, because genetic testing allows many effective prevention and treatments.† As long as the patients reach out, there will be solutions, she said.†

science,"CO‚ÇÇ and Climate Change: Same Goal, New Perspectives",18-Feb-20,8:30 AM,['Leon Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-18/co2-and-climate-change-same-goal-new-perspectives/,"With current global carbon dioxide levels far exceeding those ever before seen in historic records, climate change researchers are increasingly motivated to grasp the intricate relationships between carbon output, glaciation and climate change.† One of these climatologists is Mathis Hain, who brought his wisdom and passion for the subject to UC Santa Barbara on Tuesday, Feb. 11 for a seminar.† Hain spoke about the role of COÇÇ climate forcing and carbon cycle feedbacks in affecting ice age climate cycles. Leon Liu / Daily Nexus Hain completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Potsdam in the Berlin-Brandenburg region of Germany and graduate studies in geosciences at Princeton University before relocating to the University of Southampton as a postdoctoral researcher. He has been teaching as an assistant professor in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at UC Santa Cruz since last year. Hain's research has primarily followed the trends in carbon dioxide (COÇÇ) throughout the Holocene, the current geological epoch. He measured carbon output using radiative forcing, the difference between sunlight absorbed by the Earth and energy repelled into space.† The radiative forcing chart revealed a trend of low COÇÇ levels during the last glacial maximum approximately 21,000 years ago, as well as rising COÇÇ levels during the following deglacial period. COÇÇ measurements did not level out until the interglacial period roughly 10,000 years ago, as sea levels rose by over 100 meters. Hain reported a current radiative forcing gauge of 1.5 watts per square meter, a measurement that has reached its modern levels after skyrocketing since the Industrial Revolution. According to Hain, recurring carbon cycles can be tracked through the course of thousands of years by monitoring the relative rates of diffusion from atmospheric carbon to ocean and land cycles. This projection of COÇÇ trends is what allows meteorologists to make predictions of climate change on a global scale.† ""When the ocean warmed at the end of the last ice age, it led to a large COÇÇ increase because COÇÇ solubility increased with temperature. At the same time, as the ice melt[ed], it lowered the salinity and increased the volume of the ocean, causing COÇÇ reduction,""ù Hain said.† The current rate of COÇÇ level rise in Earth's atmosphere is a consequence of a positive feedback loop. As proposed by Russian climatologist Mikhail Budyko, climate change is drastically amplified by the the melting of ice sheets, which would otherwise reflect shortwave radiation back into space instead of absorbing it in the ground.† Inversely, larger ice sheets are generated under low concentrations of atmospheric COÇÇ, which is indicative of negative radiative forcing. This in turn translates to an elevated rate of ice formation. Under the right set of conditions, this positive feedback loop is what kick-starts global cooling and begins a new ice age.† ""Nominally, the ice ages are driven by orbital forcing. They are not driven by COÇÇ,""ù Hain explained. Orbital forcing, which refers to the effect of the tilt of Earth's axis on climate, causes fluctuations in insolation at higher northern latitudes, the first in a series of steps that leads to glaciation.† †""The orbital forcing causes very, very small changes to insolation,""ù Hain continued. ""It is a very small force that should not be able to cause an ice age unless you have a strong positive feedback that amplifies any small change in forcing.""ù† In order to further improve our understanding of climate change, climatologists use a boron isotope-pH proxy to measure the ratios of boron isotopes in the world's oceans. The isotope concentration reveals the seawater pH, which is indicative of oceanic COÇÇ concentrations. The boron isotope-pH proxy can be used to reconstruct fluctuations in COÇÇ beyond the 800,000 years worth of data extracted from ice cores.† Hain believes that the boron isotope-pH proxy may be the next step in climate change research, as it generates a baseline representation of the relationship between COÇÇ and global temperature.† ""Using the boron isotope approach in this way will allow us to systematically map COÇÇ climate forcing on orbital time scales throughout the historic record,""ù he said. ""This shall help further constrain the sea level and temperature sensitivities and how they may have changed through our history.""ù†

science,A Rooted Conversation About Hair,20-Feb-20,8:00 AM,['Surya Pugal'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/a-rooted-conversation-about-hair/,"The conversation about natural hair in the African American community has been a hard one, riddled with misconceptions that lend to discriminatory practices both within and outside of the workplace. """"òHair Love' was done because we wanted to see more representation in animation. We wanted to normalize Black hair,""ù Matthew Cherry said during his acceptance speech at the Academy Awards. Cherry also urged passing the C.R.O.W.N. Act in all 50 states. Courtesy of Sony Pictures Animation Kimika Hudson, a reporter from the Huffington Post, outlines this lack of conversation about hair in her article, ""The Missing Education on Black Hair,""ù and attempts to shed light on an overshadowed issue. Hudson points out how certain hairstyles predominant within the African American community consist of a wide variety of curl textures and, as a result, ""styling tools such as combs and brushes""ù induce hair breakage. Low sebum, which is a naturally occurring oily substance which aids in the moisturization and protection of hair, also contributes to this. As a result of this, Hudson underscores how Afro-textured hair does not benefit from frequent washing, as this removes natural oils within the hair, which significantly weakens hair fibers. According to a 2015 study published in the Brazilian journal Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia, ""fluids like water and sebum do not distribute themselves completely evenly along the hair strands, reducing the water loss capacity.""ù This can be attributed to the specific ""spiral structure""ù which accompanies Afro-textured hair, which also plays a role in making said hair more susceptible to chemical and physical damage. The study posits genetics as one of several factors that could play a role in the structure and characteristics for Afro-textured hair. In fact, Lorna Jones, a trichologist and writer for gal-dem, a magazine produced by women and non-binary people of color, underscores that only now is the role that genetics plays in the structure of hair and the scalp ""beginning to be understood.""ù Jones highlights how the recent discovery of PADI3 (a gene linked to permanent hair loss among women of color) by Ncoza Dlova, a professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's School of Clinical Medicine, may be a starting point and indicator of change for things to come. Certain hairstyles, such as dreadlocks and braids, are commonly worn as they help to preserve the texture of hair, prevent hair follicles from weathering and serve as alternatives to existing chemical straightening and heat-straightening practices, which can create significant damage to hair particles, according to Hudson. However, these hairstyles are being banned within school and work environments, largely due to a lack of awareness about differences in hair texture. As A.B. Wilkinson, a reporter from The Atlantic, points out, legal cases that have backed the hairstyle ban can be attributed to ""relying on some well-established legal precedents as well as some outdated notions of race.""ù A clear-cut example of this is the case of EEOC v. Catastrophe Management Solutions (CMS), where Chastity Jones was denied acceptance for a job at a customer service representative at a call center explicitly because of her dreadlocks. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals unanimously ruled in favor of CMS, resulting in the EEOC seeking to petition their case to the Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court decided not to review the lawsuit. Only recently has discussion about Afro-textured hair taken center stage. In the past few decades, the natural hair movement has gained momentum. In recent memory, celebrities such as Lupita Nyong'o, Janelle Mon√°e and Viola Davis took part to help increase discourse about the issue, encouraging people of color to embrace their natural hair and promoting overall acceptance. Another signal that Afro-textured hair is gaining media traction can be found in the film, ""Hair Love,""ù which features an African American father assisting his 7-year-old daughter in styling her hair. The film won Best Animated Short Film in this year's Academy Awards ceremony, shedding light on the struggles that go into taking care of natural hair. As a result of the recent discourse that has been taking place, the C.R.O.W.N. (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair) Act has been passed in three states, ruling that discrimination on the basis of hairstyle unfairly targets people of color. Despite this, there is much to be done about spreading awareness about Afro-textured hair and only through increased conversation can this be achieved.

NSBE-UCSB aims to encourage and help Black engineers and scientists ""excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact the community,""ù according to its webpage. Courtesy of Malia Kanakanui Founded in the 1970s, the National Society of Black Engineers at UCSB (NSBE-UCSB) is a student organization under the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program, which ""has strengthened math and science skills for underrepresented students and expanded access to higher education and productive careers,""ù according to its program page under UCSB's Office of Education Partnerships. The organization's members meet bi-monthly, beginning with ""a little bit of a social and [a] safe space for all the Black S.T.E.M. people [at UCSB],""ù said Malia Kanakanui, a fourth-year chemistry major and co-president of NSBE-UCSB. They then discuss upcoming events. NSBE puts on professional events, such as during its recruitment season in fall quarter. Companies co-hosted an event with NSBE to come and give talks, allowing members to speak with job and internship recruiters. Earlier this quarter, NSBE held a research outreach event where a research coordinator came and spoke about available research opportunities. ""Basically the point of the club is just saying we're trying to let people know of their options and we do that by inviting either companies or research coordinators and letting everyone know about what opportunities there are,""ù said Abel Semma, a third-year computer engineering major and NSBE-UCSB's co-president. ""Also, it's really nice to just have an hour every two weeks to just get everyone together and chill and bond,""ù he continued. Kanakanui added, ""It's really important since the Black population at Santa Barbara is like [5%] Black students overall ""¶ So to have that safe space with like-minded people, but also people that look like each other, it's nice to have because you don't see that when you're on campus a lot.""ù NSBE also frequently collaborates with another MESA engineering program partner, Los Ingenieros, as well as UCSB's College of Engineering.

I think that's how NSBE encourages [students to go into S.T.E.M.].""ù Courtesy of Malia Kanakanui Though ""Engineers""ù is in the name, the organization is inclusive of all S.T.E.M. majors. Priestley described how she initially hesitated to join NSBE since she wasn't one of the more typical ""computer science majors and engineers.""ù However, in her junior year, she decided to go to a meeting, where she realized ""you don't really have to be an engineer to be in NSBE. That's when I really started becoming more interested.""ù According to Priestley, despite not being a similar S.T.E.M. major as most members, she found ""a lot of encouragement""ù from the organization including always being welcome to join study sessions. ""They always encourage me to keep going and ask me how I'm doing academically and check in with me, which has really helped. I think that is always helpful when you have somebody that's genuinely looking after you,""ù she said. Currently, NSBE-UCSB is preparing for its major event of the quarter, the annual convention held by the national organization. In its 46th iteration, the conference will take place from March 25-29 in San Antonio, Texas. The national convention provides NSBE members a chance to network and meet people from different engineering companies for job and internship opportunities. ""It'll be a lot of Black scholars and leaders and industry representatives showing up and just giving all of the university and college students information and advice,""ù Kanakanui said. Besides professional networking and development, the conference offers an occasion to bond and ""meet other Black S.T.E.M. students, which is kind of a rarity especially on UCSB's campus.

science,Researchers in Kruger National Park Observe How Fire and Drought Shape Plant Communities,27-Feb-20,8:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/researchers-in-kruger-national-park-observe-how-fire-and-drought-shape-plant-communities/,"Deron Burkepile, a professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology has been working in southern Africa for longer than a decade, monitoring the complex and diverse plant communities which populate the region. Burkepile first began doing field work in Kruger National Park, South Africa about 15 years ago, working with other researchers in order to better understand the relationship between large herbivores and the plant communities that host them, as well as how these interactions could be influenced by a third variable: fire. In a paper published in the journal Ecology, Burkepile and his collaborators describe the striking ability of an ecosystem to recover after periods of severe drought and how the differing frequencies of fire affect the manner in which plant communities respond to drought. ""Fire is one of the other big structuring forces of plant communities,""ù Burkepile described. ""We set up this experiment where we put up herbivore closures, big fences to keep them out of certain areas of the savanna. Then we set up the enclosures in areas that have been manipulated with different fire return times.""ù Through this restructuring of fire regimes, researchers have been able to experimentally observe how different frequencies of fire influence herbivores, and how both of these affect plant species diversity, nutrient cycling in soils and the encroachment of woody vegetation. ""They set fire to some areas every year, some areas every three years and some areas haven't been burned for almost 60 years now ""¶ [with this], we can understand both the biotic component (the impact of the herbivores) and the abiotic component (the impact of fire) on these dynamics,""ù Burkepile said. Then, a fourth variable came to light. During the 2015-16 wet season, southern Africa experienced a severe drought which parched the landscape, inhibited the growth of plants and resulted in massive animal die-offs. ""It's one of the most severe droughts on record, certainly probably the most severe drought over the past several decades, where they got basically only about 10% of the rainfall that they normally get in a given year.""ù ""What we saw that year, obviously, is nothing grew. Most of the plants died. A lot of herbivores died; there's actually a lot of mortality of elephants, especially because of the lack of water.""ù The researchers, including Deron Burkepile, studied resiliency mechanisms of ecosystems in response to climate extremes, which are predicted to occur with greater regularity and intensity. They examined the consequences of a significant drought between 2015 and 2016 in southern Africa. / Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Scholars capitalized on this devastating drought to obtain information regarding the resilience and resistance of the plant communities found throughout the savanna, resilience being a measure of a plant's ability to rapidly recover from drought and resistance being a measure of a plant's ability to maintain their functions during drought. Burkepile and his collaborators were able to secure a Grant for Rapid Response Research from the National Science Foundation, given to researchers to study extreme events such as natural disasters or other anomalies. In observing the long-term impact of the drought on these plant communities, Burkepile was surprised by what they found. ""What we expected to see was this real legacy of the drought that happened. In a normal year the grasses which grow big and fast, and represent most of the biomass and most of the primary production, they seem to be hit hardest by the drought.""ù Given this, the prediction would be that after the drought, when rainfall returned to normal, there would not be as much plant biomass as compared to before the drought. However, this was not the case. Instead, within as little as a year, the aboveground net primary productivity of the plant communities recovered fully. The ""why""ù of this surprising resilience depends on the fire frequency of the plot observed. In areas subject to more frequent burning, the stunning recovery could be attributed largely to forbs and woody vegetation, which were able to grow rapidly following the retreat of grasses. ""The surprising thing that happened was that the forbs, small little flowering plants, and small little woody vegetation actually took over from grasses to become the dominant plants there,""ù Burkepile said. ""So we actually didn't see any changes in primary production before and after the drought,""ù he continued. ""But we saw that production comes from really different parts of the plant community: grasses before the drought and these forbs after the drought.""ù This is likely because once the grasses died, there existed an opportunity for the forbs to take advantage of the new light and space, according to Burkepile. ""There's lots of space for these flowering plants to germinate, grow really rapidly and take over lots of space. So I think part of the response was probably just the dieback of the grasses opening up free space for these other plants to invade and take over,""ù Burkepile said. Meanwhile, in the unburned areas, grasses still remained the dominant plants in the community even after a period of severe drought. They were able to maintain their productivity as previously subdominant annual and perennial grasses compensated for the reduced productivity of more common grasses. ""In annual burns and the three-year burns, we saw this transition from grasses being the dominant source of production before the drought to forbs being the dominant source of production after the drought. We didn't see that in the unburned areas,""ù Burkepile remarked. Now, Burkepile and his collaborators are looking to continue research, focusing on the impact of megafaunal remains, such as elephant carcasses, on their surrounding environment.

science,UCSB‚'s Fourth Annual Zero Waste Festival Highlights Sustainability and Waste Reduction,27-Feb-20,3:00 PM,['Leon Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-27/ucsbs-fourth-annual-zero-waste-festival-highlights-sustainability-and-waste-reduction/,"In order to promote sustainable living and bring attention to many nonprofit organizations, the Zero Waste Committee, an Associated Students board, hosted its fourth annual Zero Waste Festival on Friday, Feb. 21. The fourth annual Zero Waste Festival hosted by the Zero Waste Committee featured environmental organizations and local businesses to promote student education in environmental issues and sustainable living. Leon Liu / Daily Nexus The event intended to ""help us better understand the impact of the waste we create every day and the importance of living sustainably,""ù Lea Miller, one of the festival's planners, wrote in an email. It aimed to educate students on environmental issues and sustainable practices while promoting ""fun and easy sustainable tips for students to incorporate at home,""ù its Shoreline event page stated. The festival, held at Storke Plaza, featured over a dozen on-campus organizations and local businesses that are dedicated to reducing Goleta's waste output. Live music and UCSB Adventure Programs' iconic 26-foot climbing wall also made an appearance. To capture the attention of attendees, many of the stands featured interactive activities designed to educate visitors. Associated Students (A.S.) Recycling challenged guests by offering a series of Velcro-clad waste items and asking them to sort them into trash, recycling and compost categories by sticking them onto designated sections. A representative was also teaching audience members about some of the ongoing conservation efforts at UC Santa Barbara: ""Compostable cups are only compostable on campus. Please don't recycle or throw them away when you go home.""ù Another stand, A.S. Department of Public Worms, set up a booth to teach visitors about food waste at UC Santa Barbara. This student-run organization prides itself on striving for a closed-loop food system, where all nutrients in food waste are recycled back into compost to support the growth of more food. The A.S. Environmental Affairs Board prepared a booth to encourage eco-friendly habits and distribute facts regarding waste management at the school: ""UC Santa Barbara fills four large garbage bins every hour. A huge fraction of the waste in these bins can be recycled and composted if students were just more careful.""ù Several companies took this opportunity to advertise their products. Aveda, a Minnesota-based cosmetics company ""founded on the art and science of pure flower and plant essences,""ù set up a stand for students to test their products. San Francisco startup Chirps Chips also made an appearance at the festival. This company offered free samples of their high-protein, gluten-free and sustainably manufactured chips made of cricket flour. ""[Crickets] have more [vitamin] B12 than salmon, more iron than spinach and more calcium than milk,""ù the representative explained. An infographic on display demonstrated that crickets can be farmed with less than a fifth of the feed that goes toward raising beef and one-thousandth of the water necessary to produce whey. Crossroads Trading, a thrift store located on Santa Barbara's State Street, displayed a rack of second-hand clothes for attendees to browse. In an attempt to minimize the disposal of usable clothing, a representative explained that the store ""will buy your clothes and give you 50% of its worth in store credit or 30% in cash.""ù Over the past years, the Zero Waste Festival has consistently switched up its stands and attractions. Last year, the festival featured a bike-fixing workshop ""î courtesy of A.S. Bike Shop ""î and giveaways such as snacks from Trader Joe's and compostable utensils. 2017's festival featured Patagonia's Worn Wear Wagon, a setup that instructed visitors on how to repair clothing. † Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that this was the third annual festival. This year's was its fourth.† Correction: The 26-foot climbing wall belongs to UCSB Adventure Programs, not Excursion Club.†

science,UCSB Researchers Investigate Cause of Sodium Dysregulation in Migraine,5-Mar-20,8:15 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/ucsb-researchers-investigate-cause-of-sodium-dysregulation-in-migraine/,"The researchers constructed a computational model to explore the potential cause of increased sodium and CSF levels in the brain that occur during migraine headaches. Courtesy of Pixabay Migraine is a neurological disease perhaps best characterized by debilitating headaches with acute, throbbing pain, usually on one side of the head. Attacks last hours to days and can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea and acute sensitivity to light and sound. The third most prevalent global illness, migraine affects one billion people worldwide, including 39 million in the United States, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Yet much about the undertreated disease, including its causes, is still not understood. While researchers know that sodium levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue increase during migraine, what triggers the abnormal changes in concentration during migraine onset and propagation is not known. Identifying the cause of disturbances in brain sodium levels may inform potential migraine treatment. Recent research from UC Santa Barbara could shed light on how these substances in the brain are regulated during migraine. These findings are published in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience. Collaborating with Michael Harrington from the Huntington Medical Research Institutes and Samuel Grant from the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, UCSB researchers Linda Petzold and Hamed Ghaffari set out to find what causes increased sodium and CSF levels during migraine. The team followed the hypothesis that atypical sodium regulation ""î responsible for the elevation in CSF and sodium levels ""î causes migraines. This sodium dysregulation occurs at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a semipermeable structure that is highly selective in allowing specific substances to pass into the brain, and at the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB), which separates CSF from blood and from brain tissue. The scientists developed a model of a rat brain to explore the sodium exchange between CSF, brain tissue and blood. Their model showed the onset of migraine and the fluid dynamics in different areas where CSF is found in greater quantities. ""We wanted to test where the likely source of this increased sodium concentration would be,""ù said Petzold, the Mehrabian Distinguished Professor in UCSB's Department of Mechanical Engineering and Department of Computer Science. The investigators then performed a global sensitivity analysis to account for how changes in initial conditions affect the model at a future time. Specifically, they wanted to compare the significance of the BBB and BCSFB in influencing CSF and brain sodium concentrations. The researchers found that sodium concentrations in brain tissue were more sensitive to variations in the BBB within the first 30 minutes of migraine onset. Within three hours, they became more sensitive to variations in the BCSFB. ""The increased level of sodium over normal levels in migraineurs is most likely happening due to some malfunction in the choroid plexus,""ù Petzold stated. Choroid plexuses produce CSF and help form the BCSFB. They are located in the ventricular system, which transports CSF around the brain and consists of four brain cavities, or ventricles. The fourth ventricle is positioned by the trigeminal nerve. Responsible for sensation in the face, the trigeminal nerve is what causes the pulsing pain experienced during a migraine headache. ""There's the trigeminal nerve, which is the nerve that goes through your head. Most nerves are myelinated ""î they're insulated against things in their environment ""î but this one isn't,""ù Petzold explained. Consequently, the trigeminal nerve is especially vulnerable to excess sodium levels in its environment. If elevated sodium concentrations ""literally bathe""ù and aggravate the trigeminal nerve, the sodium will directly increase firing rates for neurons, according to Petzold. This results in the intense pain and sensitivity associated with migraines. ""Our computations strongly indicate that the source of the malfunction is in the fourth ventricle ""¶ We've identified the most likely source of the sodium excess,""ù she remarked. As the study is part of an ongoing project, the collaborators are now working to create a more detailed, 3D physiologically correct model of fluid flow in the brain. The updated model incorporates the glymphatic system, ""which is kind of the system of fluid flow in the brain tissue""ù that helps remove waste, Petzold explained. She and her colleagues hope to explore the effects of potential drugs with this model. ""We need to make it a little bit better because right now we're just [modeling] diffusing fluid through the brain tissue. But we know that there is also [faster convective flow] in there,""ù she said. Because sodium concentrations serve a vital role in normal brain function, Petzold mentions the possibility of their involvement in other brain disorders, which the team also plans to investigate. ""It's kind of disturbing that sodium is so out of balance during migraine,""ù Petzold said. ""And so, what if sodium is imbalanced not just here but in other regions of the brain? There's no reason to expect that it would always be in balance. Could that explain other disorders in the brain?""ù

science,A Hail Mary for the Monarch Butterfly: The Plan To Rehabilitate Ellwood Butterfly Grove,5-Mar-20,3:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/a-hail-mary-for-the-monarch-butterfly-the-plan-to-rehabilitate-ellwood-butterfly-grove/,"Since the 1990s, the population of the Western monarch butterfly has collapsed. This is not an exaggeration by any means. The Western monarch butterfly once numbered in the millions as swarms of them traversed the American West in their multigenerational migration from Mexico to Canada and back again. From 1997 to 2009, the peak number of monarch butterflies observed in overwintering sites across California was a little under four million. In 2019, that number was just over 29,000. George Thomson, the newly appointed Parks and Open Space manager for the Goleta Public Works Department, spoke on Saturday at a public forum regarding progress made in bringing back the long-declining monarch butterfly to Coronado Preserve and Ellwood. Thomson was accompanied by JoAnne Plummer, the Parks and Recreation manager for the city of Goleta, as well as Dan Meade, a principal scientist with Althouse and Meade, Inc. Biological and Environmental Services, based in Paso Robles. Ellwood was once an ideal overwintering site for the species. However, coupled with pressure and stress from infectious diseases and an explosion in the use of neonicotinoids, there has been a volley of drought and flood, resulting in the degradation of the preserve. This has been the case throughout California. According to Meade, of the 400 overwintering sites identified in the state, only 113 had any monarchs, and only 30 of those had an aggregation of more than 100 monarchs. 21 sites have been listed as ""damaged or destroyed""ù since 2016. Before 2016? 54 sites. In Ellwood Main and Ellwood Mesa, a combined count of 300 butterflies was recorded for 2019. In its heyday, Ellwood hosted 400,000 butterflies, ""or 10% of the entire California overwintering population,""ù according to Althouse and Meade, Inc. Prolonged drought parched the once-flourishing eucalyptus groves, killing more than a thousand trees; intense storms following the drought have caused considerable damage, toppling trees both living and dead and thinning the eucalyptus canopy. The use of neonicotinoids, pesticides which are neurotoxic to insects, has increased by several orders of magnitude in the U.S., coinciding with a remarkable decline in insect and bird populations nationwide. Meanwhile, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha, a protozoan parasite which is found in cysts on milkweed plants, has spread in epidemic proportions among monarchs, fueled by the widespread planting of non-native tropical milkweed. At a recent public forum, the new Parks and Open Space manager, George Thomson, outlined the plan to reestablish Ellwood Butterfly Grove as an important overwintering site for monarch butterflies. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus Meade drew attention to the condition necessary for healthy overwintering in monarchs, namely dappled light, protection from temperature extremes and protection from inclement weather such as storms and wind. During the overwintering period, monarch butterflies enter into a state of relative dormancy. Ideally, a monarch during the overwintering period will not depart from this state of dormancy until springtime. Disruptions to this can endanger the butterflies, and repeated interruptions to the dormancy period in overwintering lead to an increased risk of starvation later on. ""The main thing they need to do is nothing. The point of being in an aggregation site is to make it to the mating period in the spring. And the best way to do it is just to sit tight and hang on a branch,""ù Meade said. Another factor to consider, according to Meade, is the influence of warming temperatures on monarch butterflies, the effect of which is not entirely known. ""From the 1980s to today, San Diego County saw a 2.4 degree rise. That's a really big rise. In San Diego County and Los Angeles now, you just don't find any butterflies. There's just not an aggregation in those locations. A lot of the counts that were done down there, counting this last year, were zeros, up until Ventura really,""ù Meade said. ""So that's a factor that can really be important. [But] we just don't know whether there is a threshold ""î will it begin at 3 degrees, or 2.4 ""î and then suddenly the average temperature is too high for an overwinter period. We just had no idea if that's the case or not.""ù A related change has also been observed in the timing of the peaks in overwintering numbers among monarch butterflies, with counts in Ellwood peaking in November, rather than January as it had in years prior. After Meade concluded, Thomson went on to speak regarding Goleta's plans to rehabilitate Ellwood and reestablish its importance as a crucial overwintering site for monarch butterflies on the Central Coast. In Ellwood, enormous swathes of eucalyptus trees in the grove are dead, with many having fallen. ""We've got over 1,700 dead trees in 70 acres. So to put that in perspective, in terms of the size of the ground ""¶ [t]hat's about 25 acres, Girsh Park in its entirety,""ù Thomson said. ""So we're talking about a land area three times the size of Girsh Park with 1,700 dead trees ""î probably more now ""î trees that are dead or soon to be dead.""ù Plans to remove the trees and proceed with the plantings of saplings, as outlined by Thomson, are not without controversy. Members of the audience brought forth the point that any alterations to the plant life in Ellwood affects life beyond butterflies. Dead trees provide habitat for woodpeckers, while felled trees provide cover for native rodents and other mammals. Thomson also cited human impacts, such as traffic and suburban overdevelopment, which have also disrupted the overwintering sites of monarch butterflies in Ellwood. ""I met with one member of the audience earlier this week and he talked about, ""òIs it appropriate to have a wedding event in the grove?' Perhaps not,""ù Thomson said, somewhat sardonically, admitting afterward that misuse of the grove has been an issue in the past. However, frustration among those in the community has grown as years pass with little progress and further damage to the grove becomes evident. Plans to rehabilitate Ellwood have existed in some form or another since 2011. ""[This is] the plan that we're talking about: We're going to remove 65 downed trees and remove five standing dead trees, plant native plants and then plant 63 Eucalyptus. So what's happened with that plan? We actually got the coastal development permit issued in October 2019. So we have the permit in hand.""ù Now, six special conditions must be fulfilled in order to submit a final implementation plan, according to Thomson. Despite the ambitious long-term goal, Thomson took care not to downplay the severity of the issue or the challenges to come. ""How do we come together to make effective change and not get depressed about the current situation? It is daunting. It is a continental issue that we're trying to deal with here,""ù Thomson said. ""We're kind of in a crisis situation, and this data that Dan [Meade] was showing today really strikes to the core of the issue and how bad it is. It is really bad now.""

science,Bill Bryson Discusses New Book on Miracles of the Human Body,6-Mar-20,10:00 AM,['Anastassia Dardenne'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-06/bill-bryson-discusses-new-book-on-miracles-of-the-human-body/,"Bill Bryson is an American non-fiction author from Des Moines, Iowa. He has written over 20 books, one of which, the autobiographical ""A Walk in the Woods,""ù was adapted to film. On a tour promoting his latest non-fiction work, ""The Body: A Guide for Occupants,""ù Bryson found himself at Santa Barbara's very own Granada Theatre on Monday night. The sold-out event was organized by UCSB Arts & Lectures. Bryson's latest book highlights the wonders of the human body. Courtesy of Caitlin O'Hara Bryson began the lecture by thanking the audience for coming out to see him in such great numbers and telling an anecdote about a recent talk to an audience of just five people. ""It's a tragically true story. It was a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Scranton, Pennsylvania and they only put out six chairs so they actually thought it was quite a good turnout,""ù Bryson said, earning quite a few laughs from the audience.† The five audience members as Bryson recounted were the store manager, who was there only out of a sense of duty, two friends of his parents, a man also named Bill Bryson and the fifth, his wife, who ""frankly didn't seem to want to spend the evening with anyone named Bill Bryson.""ù In the first minutes of the lecture, Bryson had already managed to captivate the audience with a spontaneous apropos story that set the tone for the entirety of the hilarious evening.† Bryson was born in Iowa to journalist parents and had what he described as a ""very happy childhood.""ù His father had a developed sense of ""Mark-Twain style""ù humor (as did most of the people in Iowa, according to Bryson). In a short philosophical moment during the lecture, Bryson contemplated the dangers of losing the ability for humor and spoke of his impression that humor was in danger of disappearing in today's hyperpolarized world.† His own sense of humor, undoubtedly influenced by his childhood in Iowa, was immediately noticeable. Less noticeable, but just as important, was his eager curiosity towards everything and anything. The range of topics that his books cover, from a short history of the world to a memoir of his experience hiking the Appalachian Trail, is huge.† Courtesy of Caitlin O'Hara It is no surprise that his latest book ""The Body: A Guide for Occupants""ù explores yet another topic of interest to Bryson: the human body. Interestingly, Bryson has no background or connection to the medical field, except for a son in medical school, yet through four years of extensive research he managed to write a factually accurate book on the complicated workings of the human body.† ""We have a strange paradoxical relationship with our bodies, we are in a strange position, our whole existence is in this one container of flesh and tissue, and yet we in a lot of ways barely know it,""ù Bryson explained.† Bryson wanted to explore the human body from the perspective of a ""user,""ù as he calls himself. His book is essentially a roadmap of the place that is home to all people, their own bodies. This approach to the body is romantic and incites the reader to learn about themselves as they would a foreign and mysterious country. The body is complex and still largely uncharted. Nobody knows why, of all mammals, humans are the only ones with chins or why when touching something, fingerprints are left behind. The body is mysterious, and the facts that Bryson does present in his book only help to make it seem more magical. In an example he gives, there are two meters of DNA in every single nucleated cell of the human body, and if laid end to end, it would stretch for 10 billion miles, effectively extending all the way to Pluto .†† ""There's enough of you to leave the solar system,""ù Bryson exclaimed. ""The amount packed into us is staggering.""ù In another example, Bryson mentioned the human heart, a relatively small muscle that contracts and relaxes approximately 100,000 times a day. Over a lifetime, the heart does enough work to lift one ton up 150 miles into the air. But most incredible of all is the brain. It accounts for just 2% of body weight, but uses up 20% of the body's energy, equivalent to approximately 300 calories a day, or as Bryson puts it, a blueberry muffin.† ""Try running your computer on a blueberry muffin,""ù Bryson joked. Yet, mixed in with all the jokes, Bryson taught a valuable lesson: The body is incredible. There shouldn't be a day where that is taken for granted. ""You only get one life, and if you blow it by smoking and drinking [and doing other unhealthy things], you're basically an idiot.""ù

science,Researchers Use New Sequencing Methods To Study Protein Binding and Evolution,11-Mar-20,8:00 AM,['Hannah Hirou'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-11/researchers-use-new-sequencing-methods-to-study-protein-binding-and-evolution/,"UC Santa Barbara researchers Justin Yoo and Michelle O'Malley, along with prior UCSB chemical engineering professor Patrick S. Daugherty, have innovatively reimagined the way that protein sequencing is done. In a recent study, they investigated the effects that different protein mutations in an adenosine receptor, a type of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), have on ligand binding in humans.† GPCRs consist of a massive family of cell-surface receptors. When a ligand, such as a drug, binds to a certain corresponding GPCR, it triggers cascades of interacting secondary-messenger proteins to activate other biological pathways. These receptors play a key role in understanding how the body functions and reacts. GPCRs are involved in pathways such as heart function, vision and drug interactions.† The paper, published in Nature Communications, addresses something known as B.R.I.D.G.E., or bridge reads in distal sites within genes, which was one of the methods used in this study. B.R.I.D.G.E. is able to read nonoverlapping pairs of DNA and makes the study of mutations more accessible. Traditional methods of DNA sequencing require overlapping strands of DNA before the sequence can be read, which limits the identification of amino acid substitutions (i.e. mutations), resulting in protein mutations, that occur close to each other.† ""Part of the innovation here with this B.R.I.D.G.E. technology is that we are stitching together parts in a protein that would normally not be analyzed in the way that we did,""ù said O'Malley, an associate professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering.† B.R.I.D.G.E. takes advantage of Illumina technology, which finds individual base pairs in a DNA sequence and creates numerous short stretches of contiguous DNA base pairs that can patch together regions of proteins. This allows information on protein changes to be gathered comprehensively rather than in localized parts.† ""Deep mutational scanning is this method that allows for all of the protein variants and mutations to contribute to the ultimate protein that is selected at the end of a screening,""ù O'Malley explained.† This accessibility is key in exploring epistasis, which is a key question in protein engineering that pertains to evolutionary relationships between gene mutations and protein binding. ""If you have a protein that you want to evolve for a certain function, there are lots of different ways to get there. Traditionally, a lot of people have made mutations to the protein to mimic how evolution and natural selection would work,""ù O'Malley stated.† The Illumina sequencing method underlying B.R.I.D.G.E. is shown. / Courtesy of Nature Communications She used the metaphor, ""finding a needle in a haystack,""ù to explain how protein sequencing is used to find the needle if the needle were the mutation.† ""Traditionally, [with] most techniques, if you find the needle in the haystack, you are happy. But you don't know what other needles you might have left in the haystack or what else was in the haystack,""ù she said.† Examining a protein haystack requires multiple tools. Yoo, a former UCSB graduate student now based in Seattle, was the architect of the brilliant strategy that combined multiple sequencing processes.† ""We combined next-generation sequences approaches to state-of-the-art Illumina technologies ""¶ with flow cytometry and cell-based screening that, in a more traditional sense, made it possible to actually screen through,""ù O'Malley elaborated. This high throughput sequencing technology is useful in studying protein evolution. Once the researchers had their innovative protein sequencing method, they decided to test it. To do this, they engineered mutated versions of the well-studied human adenosine receptor, or the A2aR, to examine the potential effects on binding affinity to the receptor.† Five sites on the receptor were mutated based on other studies that suggested this had an effect on the binding affinity of the receptor to its ligand. To study this, Yoo ""set up this library to basically create millions of variants that took these five places in the proteins and subbed out all the possible amino acids,""ù O'Malley added.† Coupled with sequencing, Yoo's library allowed the team to know exactly which variants were winning. Among the noteworthy things that Yoo saw were ""mutants that, by themselves, were actually worse for the protein function, [but] when they co-occurred, were actually sometimes beneficial,""ù O'Malley said.† It seems counterintuitive that, for example, one protein mutation is bad but two are good. Given this, it is not simple to predict how mutations will affect protein function. It is comparable to how a negative number multiplied by a positive number results in a negative, yet two negative numbers multiplied by each other results in a positive product. Epistasis relates to the interactions of genes with one another, and in this context, mutations have the potential to positively affect ligand-binding affinity. ""The additive effect of these five mutations were actually really hard to predict. That is this term epistasis that, in the paper, is the tracking of the co-occurrence and net benefit or net drawback of these co-occurred mutations,""ù O'Malley described.† Mutations were made at varying distances in the DNA sequences to see if this would have any effect on the ligand binding. Interestingly, the results of the study seemed to indicate that ""mutations that were further away had an additive effect that was greatest,""ù O'Malley summarized. While B.R.I.D.G.E. is a clever method that makes protein sequencing potentially more accessible to studying mutations, it does have its drawbacks. Namely, it cannot be used for sequences longer than 600 base pairs. However, the paper ends on a hopeful note that future advancements in technology can help improve this method and thus reveal more information on protein evolution.

science,Renowned Journalist David Wallace-Wells Warns Against Very Real Effects of Climate Change,16-Mar-20,8:30 AM,['Anastassia Dardenne'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-16/renowned-journalist-david-wallace-wells-warns-against-very-real-effects-of-climate-change/,"David Wallace-Wells visited the New Vic Theatre recently to speak about climate change. Nick Song / Daily Nexus On Thursday, March 5, the New Vic Theatre hosted renowned journalist David Wallace-Wells for his talk, ""Surviving the World: Making the Best of a Burdened Planet.""ù Wallace-Wells is an American journalist and the deputy editor of the New York Magazine. He is most well known for his work on climate change, including his article-converted-book, ""The Uninhabitable Earth.""ù The talk was a shocking recount of the negative effects that humans have already had on the planet and the gravity of the situation if no action is taken. The event was part of the ""Forces of Nature: Activism, Education, Research & Solutions""ù series, a themed lecture and film series programmed by UCSB Arts & Lectures on the environment and the importance of conservation.† In his talk, Wallace-Wells said that he does not consider himself a nature- or animal-lover. He described himself as a ""city boy""ù who always thought nature was something ""that happened to other people.""ù Nevertheless, he fights to bring awareness to the serious issue that is climate change.† ""I'm not an environmentalist. I've never thought of myself that way. I've never gone camping. I've never gone on a hike. I've never had any pets. And while I've always thought it was nice to go on trips to visit nature, I always thought that urban life was a fortress that protected me against nature's forces. I spent my life, like a lot of people, daily [being] complacent and deluded about the threat from climate change,""ù Wallace-Wells said.† Wallace-Wells talked about the three common misconceptions that he made about climate change for a large part of his life: that climate change was happening slowly, that it was happening elsewhere and that it was happening in a way that would only marginally affect the people he loved.† ""Altogether, climate change is an all-encompassing challenge that almost anyone in this room is not comfortable acknowledging,""ù Wallace-Wells said. According to Wallace-Wells, climate change is not a slow process. He warned that unlike what many people think, climate change is not a problem that is to be left to the younger generation to fix. It is a problem that needs to be addressed now. In his talk, Wallace-Wells explained that half of the emissions that have ever been produced have come in the last 30 years, effectively meaning that the human population has managed to do more damage in the last three decades than has been done in the entirety of human existence.† He continued on to say that in the Midwest, farmers earned 40% of their income from insurance money due to flooding. In California, wildfires spring up at unprecedented rates. In Europe, heat records (originally standing for centuries) were broken three times in the same summer. In Australia, fires have been burning for months, burning almost a quarter of the continent's forest and killing 1 billion animals, even bringing some to extinction. Wallace-Wells stated that extreme weather events are only bound to worsen if action isn't taken now. He also claimed that they aren't the only negative consequence to come from climate change.† Some studies show that higher temperatures have been linked to higher rates of war and crime while pollution has been linked to lower test scores and premature births, Wallace-Wells explained.† ""When they introduced easy pass ""î where cars idle less when they go through a toll which meant they produced less concentrated pollution ""î just the effect in the neighborhood of those toll plazas reduced premature birth and low birth weight by 13%,""ù he mentioned.† Wallace-Wells estimates that even if consequential steps are taken to mitigate climate change, it is already too late to completely reverse the effects of climate change. Still, he believes it is important to try and reduce the effects of climate change and set ambitious goals.† ""As terrifying as some of these impacts may seem, they are ultimately a reflection of our power on the planet. If we are talking about a world with twice as much war and half as much food, it will be because we have chosen to make that world real,""ù Wallace-Wells explained.

science,Researchers Assess Ability of Warm and Cold Range Edges To Track Climate Change,18-Mar-20,12:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-18/researchers-assess-ability-of-warm-and-cold-range-edges-to-track-climate-change/,"As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, species are shifting their normal habitat ranges. Researchers seek to predict where and how species will move, which can inform the maintenance of food security and preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function, among other factors. But because numerous aspects come into play, how individual species respond to climate change can be difficult to forecast. The researchers examined numerous species that had either a warm range edge or cold range edge in the Northeast Continental U.S. Shelf. The black sea bass has a cold range edge in the region. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons To shed light on the subject, UC Santa Barbara researchers studied the dynamics of cold and warm range edges of marine fishes at the individual species and warm- and cold-edge assemblage levels. Cooler climates occur toward the poles in most parts of the world, making a cold range edge poleward and a warm range edge equatorward.† ""This work was trying to get a better handle on what really makes species shift their ranges and how correlated they are with temperature, which is crucial for eventually being able to predict species on the move,""ù said Alexa Fredston-Hermann, a former doctoral candidate in UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and an incoming postdoctoral fellow at Rutgers University. The scientists examined whether cold or warm range edges of fishes could better track climate change on the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf, which extends from Cape Hatteras to the Gulf of Maine. Supporting numerous fisheries, it is a ""global warming hotspot""ù with a 1 degree Celsius temperature rise in the last century, according to the study published in Global Change Biology. Using annual survey data from 1968 to 2017, the investigators looked at temperature, the ocean's most prominent climate variable, at the sea surface and sea bottom. They analyzed two groups of species: one with a cold range edge in the Northeast U.S. Shelf and the other with a warm range edge in that area. The group tested several hypotheses that may explain the shift in a species' distribution. One, called the biogeography hypothesis, was developed using mostly terrestrial systems. It states that the cold edge is temperature-mediated and the warm edge is not because the latter experiences less climate variability.† ""Instead, its position is probably mediated by interactions with other species or other biological processes, not the environment,""ù Fredston-Hermann said.†† Another hypothesis is the extinction debt hypothesis, which is also largely founded on terrestrial systems. It asserts that the cold-edge range may respond faster to climate changes than warm edges due to ""lag.""ù† ""That's partly because, for many species, colonizing a new area is a faster process than going extinct. If you go extinct, which is what might happen at the warm range edge as it becomes too warm, every single individual has to die. And if it's a tree species, for example, that could take centuries,""ù Fredston-Hermann stated. Based on these two hypotheses, cold range edges would track climate more accurately than warm range edges. Yet, a competing ocean-specific hypothesis, the ecophysiology hypothesis, suggests that the cold and warm range edges should track climate equally well. With marine species being extremely sensitive to temperature, their distribution correlates strongly with their temperature tolerance. Climate-related local extinction is much more common in the ocean, signifying that both the warm and the cold edge are temperature-mediated, according to Fredston-Hermann. The study is among the first of its kind to use annual dynamics of cold- and warm-edge ranges rather than space or time to study widespread change. The collaborators developed customized isotherms, or map lines, to plot where specific temperatures are located in space instead of using regional temperatures in their study. ""Matching a species range edge position with the position of the temperature that we established it should track was a novel way to downscale global climate change to something you can map onto the frontier of a species distribution,""ù Fredston-Hermann described. ""I think that was the most innovative part of this analysis.""ù Both the warm and cold range edges of marine species tracked temperature and shifted north to move away from warming ocean temperatures. However, the researchers found that cold edges shifted further north with warming and tracked both the sea surface and sea bottom temperature more closely than warm edges. ""We took that as evidence that the ecophysiology hypothesis must not be true for these species because the warm edges were consistently tracking temperature to a lesser degree and shifting less,""ù Fredston-Hermann said. This information also revealed that much of the effect varies by species. Fredston-Hermann emphasized the biggest takeaway from the project was that species generally cannot be assumed to track temperature perfectly. While this may be more clearly observed with terrestrial species, many models of ocean species predict that fish will start to move ""in lockstep""ù with warming as soon as temperatures change, according to her. ""Our results suggest that even among highly mobile, cold-blooded species in a global warming hotspot, they are not doing exactly what you predict based on temperature alone. And we need to get a better understanding of what [non-climate] processes are really driving these range edge dynamics before we can forecast where species will be found in the future.""ù Fredston-Hermann stresses the importance of continuing long-term surveys to have long-time data available for studies. The figure shows that if there were just two years of data and one was a year earlier or later, a potentially different conclusion might be drawn for whether the species even moved north or south. Courtesy of Alexa Fredston-Hermann Another point Fredston-Hermann highlighted was the necessity of having long-term data available for studies such as this one. ""Many of the studies looking at range edges like colonization and extinction only have a few years of data in them ""¶ Our results suggest that those kinds of studies can be very misleading, not just in the degree of change, but actually in the direction.""ù She continued, ""We think that this study really underscores how important it is to continue these long-term surveys and to extract from them as much as we can about these long-term dynamics, because we really needed 50 years of data to separate the signal from the noise.""ù Fredston-Hermann and her colleagues have conducted a follow-up study in which they extended the use of their methods from this project to determine which species are tracking temperature in other regions, including the West Coast and the eastern Bering Sea. They have also since established an objective metric for classifying species as temperature trackers, partial trackers or non-trackers. ""We're continuing to chip away at understanding the role of temperature in driving range shifts in the oceans and where we can use it to predict the future and where we shouldn't,""ù she said.†

science,UCSB Researcher Investigates Strategies for Reducing Metastatic Potential of Cancer Cell Clusters,26-Mar-20,11:45 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-26/ucsb-researcher-investigates-strategies-for-reducing-metastatic-potential-of-cancer-cell-clusters/,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Most cancer deaths are due to metastasis, in which cancer cells break off from the original tumor and develop new tumors in other parts of the body. While cancer patients may have single or clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), CTC clusters are commonly linked to greater chances of metastasis and worse prognosis. Cells in CTC clusters may have survival and reproductive advantages, such as through greater protection and dispersing in clusters rather than single cells. Yet much is still unknown about CTC cluster biology or strategies to impede their metastatic potential. Researchers, including Amy Boddy, an assistant professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Anthropology, investigated different CTC cluster factors and environmental conditions that could decrease their fitness and metastatic potential. Published in Evolutionary Applications, their study is part of the work being done by the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center consortium, of which UCSB is a participant. ""Our group studies cancer from an evolutionary and ecological perspective, so we're looking at maybe a broader theoretical framework of studying cancer cell dynamics,""ù Boddy said. ""We know a lot of ecological dynamics. So if we can take them and make predictions to apply this to cancer cells, we might be able to think of novel ways of treating or thinking about how to study cancer.""ù The researchers used mechanistic computational modeling to examine how CTC clusters of four different sizes and of varying densities ""î high, medium and low ""î could respond to certain conditions. ""A lot of the literature currently on cancer cell clusters is looking at size ""¶ but the connections within the cells matter, too. So not only are we looking at cancer cell cluster size, but we wanted to look at the density of the clusters, how many neighbors are connected to each individual cell as well,""ù Boddy described. (a) Examples of different cancer types with varying shapes, densities and cell numbers. (b) Clusters from two lung cancer cell lines, displaying differences in cluster density. (c) Simulated clusters that were used in the model. Courtesy of Amy Boddy Boddy and her colleagues studied how clusters of different sizes and densities would fare when facing different levels of environmental threats, which they called ""microenvironmental threats.""ù These challenges included varying resource availability and factors such as the immune system, chemotherapies or drugs. The scientists then measured the outcomes of cell survivability (also defined as resilience) and stability of the CTC clusters. ""What we found was that, actually, density matters a lot,""ù Boddy said.† ""If we had very large clusters that weren't extremely dense, then they were still able to dissociate and died in the model. But these strongly dense clusters, no matter small or large, were much more resilient to whatever we threw at it in the model.""ù Highly dense clusters were the least affected by low resource availability or environmental challenges. They were more resilient than lower-density clusters, regardless of cluster size or threat level.† Cluster size played a smaller but still significant role in survivability against threats for medium-density and low-density clusters. Larger clusters were generally more resilient than smaller ones. In examining stability, cluster density mattered, but not size. Highly dense clusters had a higher survival rate and greater stability, making them more difficult to dissociate compared to same-size clusters with lower density, according to the paper. Boddy noted, ""The takeaway is that we should not only be measuring the size of the cellular clusters but also the density.""ù The team found that using a combination of threat and reduced resource availability could be more effective at decreasing the survival rates of CTC clusters than applying each factor individually. ""This is extremely important for [high-density] clusters, which tend to be more resilient and more stable than [medium-density] and [low-density] clusters, irrespective of size,""ù the authors wrote. As the study was carried out using simulated models, Boddy mentioned the ""big caveat""ù is that these findings should be further tested, such as in cellular cultures (in vitro) and in mouse models (in vivo). With in vitro and in vivo testing of these findings, ""more individualized therapies directed at decreasing the metastatic potential of specific CTC cluster types with fewer side effects""ù may be developed to help increase clinical outcomes for cancer patients, the paper states. ""If there are drugs that disassociate the clusters, we need to be concerned that we are not disassociating these large, dense clusters because then we are just going to have a lot more small, dense clusters,""ù Boddy remarked. ""And so, maybe new targeting therapeutics that break down the density of the cell clusters is something that could be looked at as a future therapy, to target the absolute density of the cluster.""ù The researchers are continuing to use modeling, with some collaborators working with cell cultures. ""[They are] looking at the ecological parameters of cell cluster density in a cell culture setting ""¶ and trying to disassociate the actual density of them,""ù Boddy said.†

science,Better Together: The Evolution of Commitment and Altruism in Relationships,31-Mar-20,2:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-31/better-together-the-evolution-of-commitment-and-altruism-in-relationships/,"Recall meeting your romantic partner or a close friend. During the start of your relationship, was there uncertainty about whether it would work out? Were you willing to invest in the relationship no matter what or only because they reciprocated? To explore this topic, Tadeg Quillien, a graduate student in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences and Center for Evolutionary Psychology, examined the evolution of commitment and altruism in relationships. His study appears in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Quillien studied how humans may have evolved to demonstrate our commitment to a relationship through altruistic acts, such as by giving each other gifts. Courtesy of Pixabay According to Quillien, the paper aimed to answer two questions: Why do people care about the commitment of others, and why do we use gifts and other acts of kindness to display our own commitment? ""I think that the answer has to do with evolution: our brains have evolved, via natural selection, to make us care about commitment in relationships, and make us motivated to signal our own commitment to others,""ù Quillien said via email. He pointed out how particularly for our ancestors, having people to rely on was crucial. For example, having loyal friends to help take care of you such as by getting you food if you were sick or injured. And because others care about our commitment to a relationship, we are motivated to demonstrate our commitment to others. This can be expressed through an altruistic gesture, or doing something nice for another at a cost to yourself ""î getting someone flowers, for instance. While not extremely useful, the gift conveys that the gift-giver likes the person enough to be willing to invest time and money to obtain it. ""I think that this is what we mean when we say things like ""òit is the gesture that counts': sometimes our acts of kindness are appreciated not because of their material effects but because of what they tell people about how we feel about them,""ù Quillien stated. To test if evolution influenced our motivation to express commitment through being nice, Quillien used computational modeling to simulate how individuals can behave in relationships. Each agent in the model could decide to either invest in the relationship or walk away. Different individuals have different strategies for the game. For example, some never invest in a relationship while others invest only if the relationship appears profitable. ""What I find is that usually, after a few generations individuals are reluctant to invest in relationships, because if they don't know whether the other individual will also invest, investing is too risky for them,""ù Quillien wrote. In another set of simulations, Quillien altered the model by adding a preliminary phase at the beginning of the game. Individuals were allowed to send costly gifts to each other as a sign of their interest in the relationship. ""I found that giving them this possibility makes a big difference: in many of these simulations, evolution designs individuals who send gifts to each other as a signal of commitment, and who trust their partners more if they receive a gift.""ù While we may not know if this is what really happened during our species' evolution, ""it works as a proof of concept that evolution may have designed us to care about commitment, and to engage in altruistic acts in order to signal our commitment,""ù Quillien said. ""I think that the study shows that many of the powerful emotions that color the way we experience relationships can be explained by an evolutionary logic.""ù Another notable finding is that in some simulations, evolution favored unconditional commitment. Under a strategy of unconditional commitment, an individual shows their commitment to the relationship without necessarily expecting their partner to exhibit their commitment in return (at least, not in the short term). Although ""surprising,""ù Quillien stated that this ""makes sense""ù since ""indicating that you will invest in the relationship no matter what sends a particularly strong signal to your partner: it shows that you like them enough to be willing to take a big risk.""ù Based on Quillien's study, natural selection can, in principle, lead to the evolution of either unconditional commitment or conditional commitment. In conditional commitment, after committing to the relationship, if someone receives no signal of commitment from their partner, they cut their losses and walk away. However, in real life, there might not be such distinct strategy types, according to him. ""[I]t might be more like a continuum, with at one end people who are very cautious, and people who display unconditional love, and many degrees in between,""ù Quillien remarked. While the findings of the paper apply more generally to new relationships, Quillien mentioned that people don't simply stop caring about commitment after enough time has passed. ""People still [give] gifts to their friends, or take their partners on romantic dates in expensive restaurants, etc, even when they know each other well.""ù Quillien hopes that the study will motivate psychologists to pay more attention to altruistic behavior in which the altruist expects nothing in return, as ""this behavior may be less irrational than it seems.""ù Furthermore, it may help explain some of the psychological impacts of living in the modern world. ""Some people find modern society alienating because so many social interactions feel impersonal,""ù Quillien said. ""My study suggests that this may be because our brains are wired to look for relationships with people who are committed to us.""ù†

science,Viral Outbreaks Through the Years,2-Apr-20,9:00 AM,['Leon Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-02/viral-outbreaks-through-the-years/,"Throughout human history, no force on Earth has caused as many deaths as infectious diseases. From the common influenza to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19, mankind has consistently been at the mercy of viral outbreaks. A representation of the COVID-19 virion under an electron microscope. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons In terms of recent history, no outbreak proved as catastrophic as the 1918 influenza pandemic, which claimed the lives of over 50 million people around the world and approximately 675,000 people in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Believed to be of avian origin, this Spanish flu was particularly lethal, as it led to the death of many healthy adults with no underlying health issues. Since a vaccine had yet to be invented, the world experienced quarantine and self-isolation on a global scale for the first time.† With 30 years to prepare for another influenza pandemic, virologists were much more prepared for the Asian flu outbreak in 1957. Such preparations included the development of a prototypal flu vaccine by Jonas Salk in 1938. This revolutionary vaccine, whose distribution and testing was overseen by the Public Health Laboratory Service, was able to restrict the spread of the flu in developed cities in the United Kingdom, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. As a result, the global death toll only reached 1.1 million. In the 21st century, advancements in modern healthcare and preventative care drastically reduced the mortality rate of influenza outbreaks such as the swine flu pandemic in 2009. As a ""variant""ù form of the pig-infecting swine flu, this virus was poorly combated by the existing influenza vaccine. According to the CDC, this infection was unique among influenza outbreaks because an estimated 80% of deaths occurred in those younger than 65 years old.† During the swine flu pandemic, the United States rapidly initiated a response to the outbreak by starting to develop a candidate vaccine on April 21, 2009 ""î just six days after the first reported infection. By April 24, the CDC had uploaded genetic sequences of the virus to an international influenza database, allowing virologists across the globe to commence research and compare with existing data.† The pandemic was announced as a nationwide emergency on April 26, as the CDC began releasing antiviral medication and protective gear from its Strategic National Stockpile to hospitals and clinics across the country. To further limit spread, Americans were encouraged to practice social distancing.† Fast forward half a decade, and a deadly Ebola virus had originated from a small village in Guinea, where underdeveloped public health practices contributed to the rapid spread of the disease to bordering countries. Within eight months, Ebola had spread to seven other countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, where 6,500 healthcare workers were specifically trained for infection prevention and care, according to the CDC. Lasting over two years, Ebola led to the deaths of 11,325 individuals. The extremely high mortality rate of Ebola infections caused a considerable number of deaths among physicians, nurses and midwives. In Liberia, 8% of the healthcare workforce passed away due to contact with patients, according to the CDC. The influx of patients in hospitals also exhausted other medical resources, leading to complications in the control of other communicable diseases, such as HIV, measles and malaria in the countries affected by Ebola. Though many of us have experienced our fair share of viral outbreaks, none has had such a powerful impact as COVID-19. Since its first emergence in China in December 2019, the virus has racked up an estimated death toll of over 49,000 individuals thus far, significantly exceeding that of other recent outbreaks such as SARS, MERS and even Ebola.† Due to the novelty of COVID-19, the world was largely underprepared for such a contagious and deadly virus. As a result, heavily afflicted countries such as China, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States have scrambled to impose shelter-in-place orders to decelerate the spread of the virus. While efficient in reducing the infection rate, social distancing came with the inevitable consequence of a severe economic recession, an occurrence that remained mostly unprecedented during previous pandemics, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In particular, China has reported a 17.2% decrease in exports throughout January and February, a valuation that will not improve for several months as the rest of the world makes its way through the chain of infection.† Though the situation is fluid, nations around the world are working tirelessly to implement initiatives to obstruct the spread of the virus and synthesize effective medications and vaccines. Experts such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, are optimistic that a functioning vaccine may be concocted in as little as 18 months.† Fauci stated during the White House briefing on April 1, 2020 that a turning point will not be reached until a vaccine is created and warned individuals against easing up on social distancing until the death toll begins flattening out. Before long, the coronavirus will just be another name in a long list of illnesses that have plagued our planet.

science,UCSB Receives NSF Grant To Train a New Generation of Data Scientists,2-Apr-20,1:00 PM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-02/ucsb-receives-nsf-grant-to-train-a-new-generation-of-data-scientists/,"Courtesy of Shutterstock In a rapidly digitizing world, enterprises have the ability to store enormous amounts of data. Now, companies are focused on processing this data. Spanning statistics, computer science and mathematics, data science is a swiftly expanding field. Organizations increasingly seek individuals who can extract valuable information from huge amounts of largely unstructured data. Data scientists use advanced technical tools and algorithms for data mining, programming and organizing and analyzing data. Their findings can help influence business decisions, making data scientists an essential asset to practically all industries. To foster student engagement in data science education and outreach, the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Central Coast Data Science Initiative (CCDS) has awarded over $1.2 million to four universities and colleges. UC Santa Barbara has been granted nearly $920,000 over three years. The initiative will teach students ""the underlying principles of data science, including data-generating processes and the role of measurement, ethics and privacy, information-processing tools for harnessing the power of big data, and the oral and written communication skills necessary for pursuing effective professional careers in the field,""ù according to the CCDS website. Alongside UC Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara City College, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and CSU San Bernardino are partners in this consortium. At UCSB, the initiative will build ""on existing strengths""ù and ""emphasize programming and data inference within the context of application domains that is critical to training in data science,""ù its website states. ""The NSF grant is specifically meant to bolster the undergraduate education in data science, and is helping to both fund a cohort of motivated fellows to engage them in community outreach and on-campus data science education ""î such as by tutoring fellow undergraduates or assisting with the capstone sequence ""î as well as funding the computational systems needed to train students in data science,""ù Haraldur Hallgrimsson, a Ph.D. candidate in the computer science department who is advising and coordinating this initiative, said in an email. UCSB's Data Science Fellowship program will sponsor over 30 students each year for two total cohorts. Fellows are paid a $5,000 annual stipend provided by the NSF grant, receive hands-on training in data science, engage in outreach activities and mentoring and serve as ambassadors for data science in their institution. UCSB recently began offering introductory data science classes co-developed by the department of computer science and the department of statistics and applied probability. With the help of the grant, they will be offering a year-long, three-course sequence for fellows to synthesize and apply data science tools and techniques they've previously learned in a large-scale capstone project involving local industry partners. ""This will involve small student teams collaborating with local data science companies and institutes to get valuable hands on experience,""ù Hallgrimsson described. These courses will start in Fall 2020. ""The NSF grant is also helping to rally together faculty from many departments around this interdisciplinary initiative, as well as support from the local data science community,""ù Hallgrimsson wrote. Ambuj Singh, a professor in the departments of computer science and biomolecular science and engineering, will serve as the lead principal investigator for the initiative's efforts at UCSB. Other principal investigators include Michael Ludkovski, professor and chair of the department of statistics and applied probability; Alex Franks and Sang-Yun Oh, assistant professors in the department of statistics and applied probability; and Yekaterina Kharitonova, an assistant teaching professor in the computer science department. Senior personnel include John Gilbert, professor and vice chair in the department of computer science, and B.S. Manjunath, director of the university's Center for Multimodal Big Data Science and Healthcare and the Center for Bio-image Informatics. The fellowship application period is currently open and ends on April 17, 2020. More information, including the application, can be found here.†

science,Campus Lagoon: Yesterday‚'s Memory and Today‚'s Home,7-Apr-20,8:30 AM,['Yiu-On Li'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-07/campus-lagoon-yesterdays-memory-and-todays-home/,"The coronavirus pandemic has left Isla Vista businesses without their customers, professors without their lecture halls and students without each other. But, at UC Santa Barbara's Campus Lagoon, life endures. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons ""[A] phenomenon that I love is the cooperative hunting between the fish hunting diving birds ""¶ and the snowy egrets,""ù Lisa Stratton, the director of ecosystem management at the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER), wrote in an email. ""They work together to push the fish toward the shore where the egrets hunt and push the fish back out in the water for the diving birds.""ù Besides attracting a great deal of sunset photos and nostalgia for UCSB students in quarantine, the Campus Lagoon plays host to a wide variety of flora and fauna. These include the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), the western pygmy blue butterfly (Brephidium exilis) and ""î one of Stratton's favorite birds ""î the bufflehead, a small sea duck. The lagoon is also home to a smell that a previous Nexus article mildly termed ""pungent.""ù According to Stratton, this aroma arises from a mix of ""dead and decaying algae""ù ""î comprising phytoplankton species Ulva lactuca and Ulva intestinalis ""î that forms on the surface of the lagoon and subsequently sinks to the bottom. ""It doesn't really smell that much, but when the sulphurous smells do reach the surface it can smell a little,""ù Stratton said. Previous students bore witness to a more serious stench: The rowing team's plastic dock, stationed in the middle of the lagoon at almost all times, would often be covered in avian feces when not in use. But according to Stratton, a yearslong drought in Santa Barbara made it difficult for the team to reach the edge of Lake Cachuma, their usual rowing spot. As a result, they ended up practicing mainly in the lagoon, disturbing the dock ""enough to keep the birds off,""ù Stratton said. Despite the large role the lagoon serves in its ecosystem and the distinct impression it leaves on students, it is not an entirely natural formation. ""In the 1940's the various low points around the lagoon were more shored up to create more permanent berms that isolated the lagoon hydrologically from the ocean,""ù Stratton wrote. ""This meant it would really dry down in the fall and the fish would die and it would get a little smelly.""ù The area remained under ownership of the military until sometime in the mid-1950s, when UCSB purchased the land. According to Stratton, the university then began manually pumping sea water into the lagoon to increase its depth during the dryer months as well as constructing weirs to allow the lagoon to drain consistently in order to counteract the smell. Other characteristics of the area brought about by its former owners have persisted for longer. The military introduced invasive species such as ice plants (Carpobrotus edulis) to the area, and dry farming during the 1930s killed off most of the native biota, Stratton said. The CCBER is continuing a long-term effort to restore the area to its previous state. These projects, according to Stratton, include a biannual prescribed burn ""î first attempted in 2006 by graduate student Alice Levine ""î to clear out nonnative plants such as ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus) and replace them with native wildflowers and shrubs. But rising sea levels leave the continued existence of the lagoon uncertain, according to Stratton. On the bright side, ""Much of the area that we have restored is essentially self-maintaining,""ù she said, ""and if the berm [between Campus Point and the Research Experience & Education Facility] breaches, the system could potentially not need to have water pumped in it.""ù ""I think the lagoon is getting closer to ideal from our restoration,""ù Stratton said. ""I really get ""¶ a lot of joy sharing this awareness, experience and the opportunity to do something restorative with my staff and the students who work with us.""ù

science,Re-examining Remote Kelp Forests After 45 Years,9-Apr-20,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-09/re-examining-remote-kelp-forests-after-45-years/,"As the southernmost kelp forest in the world, this ecosystem is geographically isolated and difficult to access, making it relatively unaffected by human activities. Courtesy of Enric Sala In southern South America, there exists largely undisturbed giant kelp forests. As the southernmost kelp forest in the world, this ecosystem is geographically isolated and difficult to access, making it relatively unaffected by human activities. While losses of kelp forests are occurring in a swiftly warming ocean, these changes are spatially variable. Studying kelp forests in different regions can help researchers better understand how they function and how to improve their conservation. In particular, studying kelp forests in remote areas could allow investigators to tease apart human impacts from natural changes. This can improve understanding of human influences on local ecosystems. Researchers, including some from UC Santa Barbara, collaborated on an international study to compare conditions of the kelp forests at the southern tip of South America 45 years apart. The paper is published in PLOS One. Boasting numerous marine mammals, seabirds, dense kelp beds and crucial spawning and nursery areas for fisheries species, this remote region was surveyed in 1973 by the National Science Foundation. In 2018, the Southern American kelp forests were resurveyed as part of National Geographic's Pristine Seas project to study ecosystems in areas with low anthropogenic impacts. It was the first long-time examination of kelp forests in this region. Paul Dayton from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography was involved in both studies. ""We wanted to follow up on [Dayton's] extensive notes, which he took, and records to see whether or not the kelp forest community and the kelp forests in general had changed over the last 45 years,""ù said Tom Bell, a project scientist at UCSB's Earth Research Institute and co-author of the paper. Bell and his colleagues used the Landsat satellite imagery that was available starting in 1998 to analyze how kelp canopy density may have changed over a 20-year period. They saw no significant difference in density between then and now. However, they did notice that the kelp density dynamics were based on roughly four-year cycles which appear to be negatively correlated to the El Ni√±o""ìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) index, during which tropical eastern Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures warmer. ""We found that the kelp density kind of follows those climate cycles, which are mostly natural cycles ""¶ When the El Ni√±o""ìSouthern Oscillation index is high, it usually means warmer waters with less nutrients,""ù Bell said. During the ENSO period, the southern Argentinean kelp canopies typically have reduced density. This pattern is seen in Californian kelp forests as well, according to Bell. The researchers examined the kelp forest communities in the remote region. Courtesy of Manu San F√©lix The scientists also conducted diver surveys to gather information about the kelp forest's benthic communities and fish assemblages. Their data showed that the kelp forest ecosystem did not experience many changes over the past 45 years, which Bell called ""encouraging.""ù The relative abundance and assemblage structure of sea urchins, and the abundance of kelp and sea stars remained similar. ""We have seen climate change negatively affect kelp systems in some parts of the world, like off the coast of Australia and New Zealand. However, we did not find that here,""ù Bell stated. According to Bell, a lack of direct anthropogenic stressors in this largely isolated region may have allowed conditions of the kelp forests to keep ""fairly stable""ù during the study period, despite the near four-year ENSO oscillations. The findings demonstrate the robust resilience of kelp forests. Additionally, they highlight the major role that oscillatory natural climate cycles play in kelp dynamics. ""[These climate cycles] should be studied more closely before we look at global dynamics of kelp from one time point to the next,""ù Bell remarked. ""If the team had gone down there in two years, like two years from now or if they were down there right now, they might see a completely different picture of the kelp forest and would have surmised that the kelp has declined a lot in the last 45 years.""ù But through using Landsat imagery, the group could obtain a time series of the kelp canopy even when it might have been difficult to dive for measurements. ""That allowed us to see these oscillatory cycles of the kelp forests that we wouldn't have seen normally,""ù Bell said. ""I think that it really shows the power of using remote sensing to generate a continuous time series of data to really understand the system.""ù Although ocean temperatures in this region are predicted to increase more slowly than in other areas, other factors,such as the possibility of kelp harvesting, will likely have eventual impacts. In their paper, the researchers propose creating a marine protection network in this region to conserve its biodiversity and ecosystem services. The scientists will continue to monitor and amass data for kelp forests. Bell stresses the importance of projects like this to study areas around the globe for greater understanding of our ecosystems.† Backed by The Nature Conservancy, he is working on building a global dataset of canopy-forming kelp species to assemble a time series of 20 or more years for kelp forests in different regions around the world. ""We can better understand how these changes in ocean dynamics control these systems and identify areas where we would expect that anthropogenic impacts have changed kelp forests,""ù Bell said. †

science,"UCSB Researchers Investigate the Impact of Nitrogen Pollution on Coral Bleaching in Moorea, French Polynesia",14-Apr-20,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-14/ucsb-researchers-investigate-the-impact-of-nitrogen-pollution-on-coral-bleaching-in-moorea-french-polynesia/,"Researchers with UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute have discovered an important relationship between the extent of coral bleaching experienced by a reef and the level of nutrient pollution present in the water the reef is in, with significant implications for ways to ensure the proper stewardship of reefs for the future. The Nexus spoke with Mary Donovan, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSB currently working with Deron Burkepile in the ecology, evolution and marine biology department. Coral bleaching is a process in which corals will, under extreme stress, expel their endosymbionts: algae that ordinarily live inside of the coral structure, the tissue of coral themselves.† ""When the corals get really stressed, they expel those symbionts, because that relationship becomes toxic, and the symbionts are taking more from the coral than the coral is getting back in that normally symbiotic relationship. And how that manifests is that the coral turns white, because the algae is what gives the coral its color,""ù Donovan said.† ""The coral themselves are not dead yet ""î they're still eating and breathing ""î but they're in jeopardy; they don't have that beneficial relationship that helps them survive.""ù Donovan, the lead author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, first came on board the project in 2018, working with and making models using data collected in 2016 in Moorea, a mountainous island located in French Polynesia just 11 miles northwest of Tahiti. ""You could refer to it as a ""òHigh Island;' it has quite tall mountains, and then the island is surrounded by a lagoon. The lagoon is made up of these shallow habitats that are a place where corals live, and then there's also a reef outside of the lagoon as well,""ù Donovan said. ""The human population lives right by the coast, because otherwise, the rest of the landscape is dominated by these steep mountains,""ù and because of their proximity to the coast, these settlements lie on the urban-coastal interface, and waste has a more direct pathway to the ocean and marine habitats than other locations. Chromis reef fish swim by staghorn coral, one type of coral the researchers studied in Moorea. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The year 2016 was characterized by anomalously warm conditions all across the world. In Moorea, this manifested as a marine heat wave, resulting in coral bleaching of varying intensity across the seascape. In response to this, researchers involved in long-term monitoring on the island went out into the field to collect data regarding the condition of the habitats surrounding it. ""They anticipated this happening, and so they went down to do field work and collected this data during the heat wave, with the broader goal of understanding the temperature and the heat and how that affected the coral, as well as how that heat wave interacted with the pollution from that tropical island itself,""ù Donovan stated.† Researchers gathered information from broad swathes of Moorea, surveying much of the waters surrounding the ocean. Data was gathered regarding the condition of the coral themselves, with researchers traveling by boat to about 80 different sites across the seascape. ""[They'd] disembark from a boat and investigate features in the water, investigating the corals themselves. At the same time, we also collected little samples from algae. The algae was how we were able to measure nutrients. So the algae takes in nutrients from the environments and stores it in tissues, and that's how we are able to measure nutrients in the environment,""ù Donovan explained.† ""We observed corals around the entire island. Altogether, that represented quite a large area, about 50 square kilometers.""ù Being able to pin down nutrients through algae allowed the researchers to discern the levels of nitrogenous pollution entering the water. ""The third factor was the data on the temperature, and so that came from instruments that we place in the water, that we deploy out into the water that's recording things like temperature continuously over time,""ù Donovan said.† The results were illuminating. Nutrient pollution intensified the bleaching exhibited by coral, remarkably so during times of moderately warmer-than-average conditions.† ""What was more interesting was when there were some situations on the spectrum where the conditions were hot, but not as hot as some other more extreme events. On the end of the scale, the corals that were exposed to nutrients were more likely to be severely bleached, meaning it was much worse for them if they were in the presence of the nutrients than if they weren't,""ù Donovan said. The introduction of pollutants to water significantly lowered the threshold at which corals would begin to bleach.† ""What was really interesting about this finding was that not only did we observe it over the entire island at quite a large spatial scale, but we also observed it in two different types of corals: Acropora corals and Pocillopora corals. In both of those corals we found the same pattern.""ù† Now, the researchers plan to continue studying the corals around Moorea, hoping to unearth more information disentangling the effects of the many variables all playing into the decline of coral reefs globally. A marine heat wave that occurred in Moorea in 2019 ""î one even more severe than the event in 2016 ""î is provoking further research in the area, with field work continuing. ""Not only are we going to be studying the bleaching of the corals, but we're also going to look at what happened to those corals afterwards. Did they die? Did they survive? What implications does that have for the ecosystem?""ù Donovan said. ""One of the things that happens in coral reefs, and there's been quite a bit of research in Moorea about, is that algae can take over, and the balance between algae and coral is undermined when these things happen, especially in the presence of human impacts. We're studying how that might be related to the outcome for the reef and also what that means for people.""ù

science,California Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment and Living Shoreline Restoration Opportunities,15-Apr-20,12:00 PM,['Gracie Shi'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-15/california-sea-level-rise-vulnerability-assessment-and-living-shoreline-restoration-opportunities/,"Driven by climate change, the problem of rising sea levels has always been a big concern for California as a coastal state. Each year, many researchers and environmental scientists are working hard to develop strategies for protecting and preserving our coast. An example of a coastal habitats strategy that has worked for Santa Barbara County is the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve in southwest Santa Barbara County. Courtesy of Alyssa Mann On Monday, April 13, Alyssa Mann, who is currently the coastal project director at The Nature Conservancy, gave a presentation on the topic ""California Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment and Living Shoreline Restoration Opportunities.""ù† In the seminar, she provided not only information and facts about what California as a whole has done to protect our coast but also specific actions Santa Barbara County has taken to make contributions. The seminar, part of the Conservation and Restoration Ecology seminar series hosted by UC Santa Barbara's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration, was held via an online video conference platform, Zoom, due to the campus's transition to remote instruction.† Mann started the seminar by giving a detailed overview of one of the studies done by her and her team, ""Conserving California's Coastal Habitats: A Legacy and a Future with Sea Level Rise,""ù including what were the drivers, what data were used, how they approached vulnerability, some of the products, lessons they learned on the way and how they are using this scientific knowledge as a foundation to spark action at the local and statewide levels.† Mann mentioned that the study was ""the first California statewide comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of habitat and conservation land to sea level rise, and provides strategies to that critical habitat.""ù First, Mann showed how the vulnerability is calculated and used multiple maps to illustrate how much of California's coastal habitats are vulnerable to five feet of sea level rise.† A five-feet sea level rise vulnerability index of coastal areas in California. Courtesy of Alyssa Mann ""The study includes the sea level rise vulnerability assessment. Statewide sea level data [was] used.""ù The conclusion was that ""59% of the area of California's coastal habitats are vulnerable to five feet of sea level rise.""ù ""The study identifies the strategies to conserve habitat. This is probably the most important product that came out of these assessments. The vulnerability assessment provides important information, but that vulnerability really needs to be translated into action,""ù Mann said.† After presenting the vulnerability assessment, Mann talked about the strategies to mitigate that vulnerability along the coast. For example, the highway. Due to the fact that the highway is not above the existing sea level, it is clear that the highway is really vulnerable and strategies need to be adopted.† To help with the highway, Mann said, ""We are working with Caltrans, the region's transportation agency and many others to develop strategies for highways to improve habitat resilience.""ù Although all kinds of actions are being taken by different organizations and agencies, with the current situation, there is still much work to do. Mann and her team found that 67% of the upper beach is highly vulnerable, and nearly all of the upper beach northwest of Isla Vista has a high vulnerability to sea level.† ""The good news is that there is some hope. Our study shows that we could have more coastal habitats with five feet of sea level rise as we have today, ensuring that future generations can enjoy these remarkable benefits,""ù Mann said.† Preserving the biodiversity of nature also plays an essential role in helping to solve the issue. Mann introduced the Hope for the Coast initiative, which was launched under The Nature Conservancy. According to Mann, the mission of the project is ""to maintain and enhance California's coast in the face of sea level rise, other climate change-induced challenges and development.""ù The project has received support from state agencies, local governments, federal partners, regional organizations and many other groups. In fact, the City of Goleta and the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors adopted the Hope for the Coast initiative in 2018 and were among the first signatories to join the Hope for the Coast.† Mann mentioned a great example of a coastal habitats strategy that has worked for Santa Barbara County: the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve in southwest Santa Barbara County. The Dangermond Preserve protects the woodlands, grasslands, waterways and hundreds of species of animals along its coastline. The preserve is managed by The Nature Conservancy and was established in 2017.† At the end of the seminar, Mann expressed her optimism in terms of resolving the rising sea level issue. ""We've got a long way to go, but I am hopeful.""ù

Courtesy of the CNSI But while most of the campus remains silent, the 3D printer in the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), located in Elings Hall on campus, hums steadily day through night, producing protective face shields for medical workers at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.† Daniel Magnuson, a third-year mechanical engineering student at UCSB, usually starts his shift in the lab in the afternoon once he's finished with his classes for the day; he works into the evening, sometimes staying until 9 p.m., or returns to the lab after having dinner.† The routine makes for a long day for Magnuson, but the extra hours in the lab and late nights are worth it, he said.†† ""After a long day of work, your body starts to hurt and you're really tired, but it's reinvigorating to know that these devices are going straight from our hands to the hospital,""ù Magnuson said. ""I think that that's really what's keeping me going right now, just the fact that we can have such an immediate impact.""ù† The urgent production of face shields on campus is just one example of how skilled students, researchers and scientists from UCSB are uniting to help the community through the coronavirus pandemic. When the campus was still open, another group of researchers in the Materials Department made batches of hand sanitizer for community use. And presently, professors across campus are developing a coronavirus test that would be simpler and faster than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coronavirus test.†† Face Shield Production Back in the CNSI lab, Magnuson and David Bothman, the organizer behind the face shield production, work opposite shifts to keep the 3D printer running to produce as many parts as possible for the face shields. The shields, which are meant to go over medical goggles and face masks, consist of a transparent shield, headband and strap, all based off a design created by a 3D printer manufacturer. By early April, the team had created and delivered 40 face shields to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and had 40 more ready for delivery. But the hospital's needs are ""tremendous,""ù said Bothman, who normally lectures on mechanical engineering at UCSB. ""The hospital needs 10,000 shields of the style we're making. We can make, you know, 20 or 30 a day ""¶ but it's clear that a lot of other people and people with a lot more manufacturing capability are going to need to be involved,""ù Bothman said.† Other groups on campus have joined in the production of face shields, including Roger Green, manager at the chemistry and biochemistry machine shop. He and Andy Weinberg, the machine shop superintendent, obtained enough materials to make 3,000 face shields. The two had finished cutting the clear plastic covers for 200 shields with a 3D printer in early April and with the help of a couple more people in the production process, Green said his team would likely soon be able to produce about 200 clear plastic covers a day. Hand Sanitizer Production Over in the Materials Department, Assistant Professor Angela Pitenis had been worrying about the coronavirus pandemic early on. Before UCSB canceled in-person classes on March 10, she cut the normal lesson plans she had for her graduate class, Colloids and Interfaces, and instead presented on the colloidal formation and stability properties of hand sanitizer.† Taking notice of the rising anxiety over coronavirus among the students in her class, she decided to dedicate a lecture to demonstrate how to make basic hand sanitizer. Then she had the idea to produce hand sanitizer for the entire campus community.† ""This whole project really began as a truly class exercise to demonstrate basic principles, but it also links back to the work that we do every day in materials science,""ù Pitenis said. ""I think it was a very good lesson for the students to be able to see how lessons in the classroom can translate to practical engineering solutions, especially in response to COVID-19.""ù Joining forces with colleagues Rachel Segalman, Rapha√´le Cl√©ment, Craig Hawker, Christopher Bates and Michael Chabinyc, all professors in the UCSB Materials Department, the group pooled together their reagents to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in their labs for community usage. ""Basically, any kinds of solutions we could find, we would put them together,""ù Pitenis recalled. She said she isn't sure how much hand sanitizer they made altogether, but she estimates ""gallons.""ù One of Segalman's lab members, chemical engineering doctoral student Audra Destefano, came up with the creative idea to design a label and call their hand sanitizer ""Universal Corona Sanitizing Balm.""ù ""[The name], which was very clever ""¶ really encapsulated the efforts we were trying to do here, which was to support our community,""ù Pitenis said. The scientists distributed their hand sanitizer around campus, including among their shared facilities, the Materials Research Lab and the CNSI. ""A lot of the hand sanitizer went directly to those shared facilities to support students and staff at the time who were still having to use those shared facilities to maintain their critical research, and also to support our staff, who might not have time in between experiments to wash their hands,""ù Pitenis described. However, Pitenis emphasized handwashing over hand sanitizer, noting that it is more effective and a practice that the CDC recommends.†† Since campus operations, including most research labs, have shut down, Pitenis and her colleagues have ceased their hand sanitizer production, for now.† ""I think we've made enough to support the needs of our community,""ù she remarked, adding that if there was a need for more, her team could always produce additional hand sanitizer. ""I think we're all trying to help out as much as we can; I think this is a total team effort right now. And I'm just incredibly amazed and I'm just humbled by the efforts of my colleagues,""ù Pitenis said. Coronavirus Test Development† Across campus, four professors from the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) are working tirelessly to develop a coronavirus test that would be faster and easier to use and would not ""rely on the common reagents that the rest of the world is scrambling to get,""ù said Max Wilson, an assistant professor in the MCDB department.† Wilson, Carolina Arias, Diego Acosta-Alvear and Kenneth Kosik all know each other from teaching and working together in the MCDB department, but as the coronavirus pandemic tore through U.S. communities and the lack of available testing became more obvious, the group stepped up to help fill the gap in resources and information. ""We saw that there was a massive need for testing and we decided that we would use our labs and our skills as molecular biologists to help,""ù Wilson said. ""We were all scientists studying other things before this. We dedicated funds from [other projects] to develop this because we saw how important it was.""ù† Using the CDC's test as a benchmark for accuracy, the team created a test for coronavirus that uses an enzyme similar to the family of enzymes used in a CRISPR test, a method that scientists around the nation have already begun to tap into that targets repetitive DNA sequences. This test uses the enzyme to recognize the presence of the coronavirus viral genome and indicates a positive or negative result on a lateral flow dipstick, a testing device similar to those used for pregnancy tests, according to Wilson.†† By the beginning of April, the group was tinkering with adjustments to the test to make it cheaper and easier to use. The professors also began looking into the process of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, which is currently being fast tracked for coronavirus tests but could still likely take months.† ""It's gonna be a long way, unfortunately,""ù Arias said. ""We are still far. I don't want to give anybody false expectations or false hope†that we're going to have something that can be deployed tomorrow. It is a process [that requires] approval.""ù†† In addition to developing a new coronavirus test, the professors also donated enough critical reagents, an essential component in the current CDC coronavirus test, for 600 tests to the Cottage Health laboratory, the Santa Barbara Independent reported. Arias' role in the project has been to coordinate approval processes and navigate protocols for the research to take place. Besides that, she also teaches general animal virology to a class of 185 students remotely ""ì""ì a task faced by UCSB's entire teaching faculty and one they had a mere two weeks to prepare for ""ì""ì and serves on UCSB's COVID-19 Response Working Group.† ""And we have families so we don't stop.

""I cannot even tell you at what time [the day] begins or what time it ends.""ù† But the researchers are propelled by an extreme sense of urgency to find solutions and provide information to the public, a collective effort they ""hope is going to be significant""ù in the community's fight against coronavirus, Arias said.† Looking ahead, the team is discussing the possibility of using their coronavirus test in a research project that would focus on the prevalence of coronavirus in asymptomatic patients. The project could reveal information about how the virus spreads, but until the test is FDA approved, patients involved in the project would not be able to know the results of the testing, Wilson said.† While much remains uncertain about the timeline of their projects and the future in general, Wilson, Arias, Acosta-Alvear and Kosik are steadfast in their mission to help.† ""A lot of people might feel helpless and I just want to reassure them that many of the best scientists I know are working as hard as they possibly can to come up with solutions that will ease the pain on this pandemic,""ù Wilson said.

science,Q&A on COVID-19 With Dzwokai Zach Ma,20-Apr-20,7:14 AM,['Leon Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-20/qa-on-covid-19-with-dzwokai-zach-ma/,"The Daily Nexus conducted an email interview with Dzwokai Zach Ma, UC Santa Barbara associate professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology, on April 17 about the COVID-19 pandemic. Ma completed his graduate research at UC Berkeley and became a postdoctoral fellow under UC San Francisco's physiology professor Lily Jan. Dzwokai Zach Ma studies virus-host interactions, with a focus on the measles virus. Courtesy Photo He is currently conducting research at UCSB on virus-host interactions with a focus on the measles virus and has agreed to use his expertise to explain the intricacies of COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Leon Liu (LL): How does the infectionability of COVID-19 compare with that of other diseases? Dzwokai Ma (DM): Scientists use R0 (the average number of secondary cases that results from one infected person) to describe how contagious and infectious a pathogen is. So far, most studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has an R0 of 2-3 (with one exception reporting a much higher value 6.5). This value is higher than seasonal influenza viruses, (R0 is 0.9 to 2) but lower than some most infectious viruses such as measles virus (R0 is 12-18) or polio virus (R0 is 5 to 7).††† LL: Why are so many people with COVID-19 asymptomatic carriers? Why do symptoms vary so much from person to person, and how do symptoms reflect what the virus is doing to people at the molecular level? DM: Many viral illnesses display variable symptoms among people, depending on the individual's susceptibility. With that said, the symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 can vary dramatically from very mild (or even no symptoms at all) to very severe, life-threatening conditions. It is currently not known what causes such drastic variation and some experts think that the answer may lie in our genes. These asymptomatic (together with pre-symptomatic) carriers pose a major challenge to disease control since emerging evidence suggest that they can easily pass the virus to others. Mild symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus include dry cough, fever, and fatigue. However, if the virus starts to attach to the lower respiratory structures, it will cause more damage to the lungs and inflammation will become more pronounced. The combined damage caused by the inflammation and infection will result in the buildup of debris and fluid between the capillaries and air sacs of the lungs, inhibiting the movement of oxygen from the air sacs to the red blood cells in the capillaries. The lack of oxygen in one's blood will cause shortness of breath and, in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS carries a high mortality and people who survive often have some degree of permanent lung damage. In addition to the lungs, the virus can also affect other organs such as the heart and kidney. It is unknown at this moment whether the SARS-CoV-2 infection may have any long-term health impact on those who have minimal or mild symptoms. LL: Why are there such large variations in incubation periods for the virus among different people? DM: The incubation period of a given respiratory viral illness typically spans a few days. Variation in this period is caused by a combination of several factors such as the dose and route of initial viral inoculation, and subsequent interaction with the individual host. Although the 2-14 day incubation period reported for SARS-CoV-2 spans a wide range, it should be pointed out that 14 days represents the longest predicted incubation time. A recent published study from a larger data set argues that SARS-CoV-2 actually has a mean incubation period of 4.9 days, which is similar to those for SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus).†† LL: What does it mean to ""flatten the curve""ù and why is it so important for us to do so? DM: As mentioned earlier, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than most influenza viruses.† In addition, most experts agree that it also has a higher fatality rate compared to influenza. Thus, a sharp increase of infected cases within a short period of time will exhaust medical resources, ultimately leading to a significantly higher mortality rate.† Many people feel that this may explain, at least partially, the significantly higher COVID-19 death rates in several European countries compared to the global average. Thus, slowing the virus' spread (i.e. flattening the curve) means that fewer people need medical assistance at any given time, which could save many lives. LL: To what extent are social distancing practices working in helping [to] limit the spread of the virus? DM: The R0 value mentioned above is situation-dependent. The risk is higher in closed environments and densely populated areas. For SARS-CoV-2, the two known major routes of transmission are via respiratory droplets (produced when the infected person is coughing or sneezing) and contacts (direct contact with an infected person or indirect contact with the contaminated surface), both of which can be greatly reduced by practicing social distancing and staying at home. Available data from many countries, including the United States, have strongly supported the effectiveness of practicing social distancing to slow the virus's infection rate. LL: When do you believe the ""turning point""ù of the outbreak will be in the United States? For the rest of the world? DM: This is a difficult question to answer since it depends on many factors, including the effectiveness of preventative or confinement measures, development and availability of drugs and vaccines, hospital capacity of a community, potential mutations of the virus itself, etc. In addition, different regions of the world, and even different parts of the United States, are likely to reach the peaks at different times. This trend has already been observed in Asia and Europe.† LL: How are vaccines created and tested during the emergency situations of a viral outbreak? DM: Vaccines can be created from attenuated or inactivated viruses, viral proteins or peptides, or viral nucleic acids ""¶ The nucleic acid based method can be done quickly; a company called Moderna Therapeutics has utilized the RNA-based design, and developed a putative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for human trials less than 2 months after the release of [the] SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence. In addition, many companies in the world are working aggressively to develop other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.† Typically, the development of a vaccine goes through different phases including the exploratory stage (initial design in the basic research laboratory), pre-clinical stage (safety and immune response tests in animals), Investigational New Drug application stage (procedure review by FDA, US Food and Drug Administration), clinical trial stage (evaluations in human subjects), and approval/manufacturing stage. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, FDA and EMA (European medicines agency) held a joint meeting in March with the hope to streamline the regulatory process and facilitate accelerated vaccine development.† LL: How long do you believe it will be until a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is synthesized?† DM: Historically, the development of vaccines takes many years. With modern techniques, this process may be shortened, but accompanied with significant variations. For example, it took less than a year for the first swine flu vaccine to be available, but 20 months to develop an SARS vaccine for its first clinical trial. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated that it will take 12 to 18 months to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. However, many states allow the use of convalescent plasma, which contains the antibody against SARS-CoV-2, to treat COVID-19 and the preliminary results are promising.† LL: Which medications have demonstrated success in countering COVID-19? DM: Based on my understanding, there is no ""definitive""ù evidence for the effectiveness of any drugs in the treatment of COVID-19, which would require a large-scale double-blinded study. However, an initial multinational study with remdesivir, a drug known to block the replication of some coronaviruses, shows a promising result in treating patients with severe COVID-19. There have been split opinions regarding the effectiveness of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients. LL: Is there any evidence that COVID-19 will exhibit seasonal variance like influenza? How do epidemiologists even answer a question like that to begin with? Will we have to wait until summer before we know or is there a more clinical and less statistical way to ascertain this? DM: Coronaviruses represent one major agent of the common cold and they generally prefer a cooler and drier climate. Thus, some experts predict that SARS-CoV-2 will exhibit seasonal variation like influenza viruses. However, since SARS-CoV-2 is a novel type of coronavirus, it is a bit too early to say with certainty how much the warmer weather in the summer will impact the spread of COVID-19. Recent surge in the number of confirmed cases in Singapore, where the temperature has been in the range of 80 to 90 degrees [Fahrenheit], indicates that the warmer weather alone might not be sufficient to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.†† LL: COVID-19 is likely to have gone through an intermediary before being transmitted to humans. How does cross-species infection work? What makes COVID-19 transmissible to so many species?† DM: The current consensus is that this RNA virus originated in bats and was probably transmitted to humans via one or more intermediate hosts. Due to the high mutation rates associated with RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, intermediate hosts provide an environment for these viruses to evolve into more transmissible forms for human infection. A recent study suggests that pangolins may have been one intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. Given that the spike proteins on the surface of coronaviruses play a key role in the invasion of host cells, researchers compared the amino acid sequences of spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses found within bats and pangolins. Interestingly, they found that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is more similar to the pangolins['] coronavirus than the bat coronavirus.†† LL: What policy measures with regards to public health do you think should be put in place in order to prevent another pandemic of this magnitude in the future? Is there a consensus among experts regarding what these should be? If not, why is that the case? DM: Abundant preparation in advance and quick targeted responses during the early outbreak can go a long way to prevent another pandemic of this magnitude in the future. It would be helpful if we could discuss and adopt a nationwide plan for how to quickly identify those at a higher risk (e.g. integrating recent travel history into the health system), conduct mass screenings and effective contact-tracing/quarantines, strategically allocate medical resources, and adequately supply protective equipment.††

science,UCSB Researchers Demonstrate Potential of Antibody-Measurement Technique Using HIV Samples,21-Apr-20,8:30 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-21/ucsb-researchers-demonstrate-potential-of-antibody-measurement-technique-using-hiv-samples/,"Antibodies, proteins produced by the immune system, bind to foreign particles in the body such as viruses or bacteria, called antigens. They are crucial diagnostic biomarkers that can inform a quick diagnosis of a medical condition in an individual. Yet measuring specific antibodies (in contrast to simply detecting their presence) remains difficult. Researchers at UC Santa Barbara are addressing this challenge by developing technology that can provide fast, easy-to-use antibody quantification for medical testing.† E-DNA scaffold sensors, developed several years ago in chemistry professor Kevin Plaxco's lab, have previously shown the ability to detect antibodies in small volume samples rapidly and in a single step. ""More recently we have worked hard to demonstrate they can actually have a major impact on the way we detect antibodies,""ù Claudio Parolo, a former Beatriu de Pin√≥s postdoctoral fellow in Plaxco's lab and recipient of the 2016 Lindros Award for Translating Research to Medical Practice, said in an email. To further assess the clinical potential of E-DNA sensors, the group tested them on authentic human samples of antibodies diagnostic for HIV. The researchers then compared the performance of the E-DNA scaffold sensors against those of two current gold standard techniques for antibody quantification. Their results are published in Microsystems & Nanoengineering. a. When the targeted antibody is absent, the DNA scaffold transfers electrons to the gold electrode. Upon antibody binding to the epitope (antigen), electron transfer is reduced. b The resultant change in electron transfer rate is detected using square wave voltammetry. Addition of the target antibody produces a decrease in the signaling current. Courtesy of Microsystems & Nanoengineering One common method of serological testing, which measures the amount of antibodies in the blood, is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). While it delivers accurate results and can test numerous assays simultaneously, an ELISA takes up to 20 steps to carry out, hours to complete and must be performed by trained personnel using specialized equipment. Another leading technique, the lateral flow assay (LFA) ""î which is used in home pregnancy tests ""î is inexpensive, quick and simple to perform in just two steps. Still, LFAs are limited in their ability to measure multiple analytes at once, are qualitative (mostly used for ""yes/no""ù responses) and time-sensitive, as the test must be read in a narrow time window. Finding a way to combine the advantages offered by each immunoassay platform could enhance serological testing and enable ""improved diagnosis within the timeframe of a single visit to the clinic,""ù according to the paper. Parolo, the lead author of the study, and the other scientists first established a baseline analytical standard. Using real patient serum samples, some of which were HIV-positive and some HIV-negative, they determined the clinical sensitivity and specificity of ELISAs and LFAs. The investigators aimed to match the sensitivity and specificity of these techniques in E-DNA scaffold sensors ""î and in two or fewer steps, in 12 minutes or fewer, in quantitative detail and without a fixed read-out time window. The performance of the E-DNA scaffold sensors paralleled the performances of ELISAs and LFAs, the study reports. ""[The E-DNA sensors] discriminated HIV-positive and HIV-negative as [well as] the other two techniques,""ù Parolo said. In fact, the clinical sensitivity of E-DNA sensors exceeded that of LFAs. E-DNA scaffold sensors could also provide quantitative information about antibody levels. Although ELISAs showed better analytical sensitivity limits of antibody detection, the E-DNA sensors delivered similar results for this serum test set ""î but in minutes and with one step. The researchers demonstrated the applicability of E-DNA scaffold sensors by detecting HIV-diagnostic antibodies due to a ""clinical need""ù as well as the potential to ""give a real contribution to the field of HIV-diagnosis,""ù according to Parolo. Nonetheless, the platform can be adapted to detect any type of antibody as long as there is a well-defined bioreceptor on the antigen to which it can bind. ""For example we could use it for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or for the detection of antibodies produced in response to an allergic reaction, and even for validating the efficiency of a new vaccine,""ù Parolo said. He continued, ""We are very satisfied with the behavior of our sensors and we believe that they can represent an alternative to current serological tests ""¶ Although replacing technologies that have been out there for almost 50 years is not an easy challenge, we will do everything we can to convince people of the huge potential E-DNA scaffold sensors can have on serological studies and diagnostics.""ù Now a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow at the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Parolo is continuing his work with E-DNA scaffold sensors. His current project intends to consolidate E-DNA sensors in a paper-based microchip. ""I am now trying to combine the E-DNA scaffold sensors into a cheap, environmentally friendly and safe platform made of paper,""ù he said. With this, Parolo seeks to help diagnose HIV and syphilis in pregnant women. A precise diagnosis can initiate treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission. ""I hope that during the next months I will be able to go into low income countries to test the final platform in the field.""ù

science,Clear As Mud: Planktonic Remains in Millenia-Old Mud Reveal Climate History of Pacific,23-Apr-20,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-23/clear-as-mud-planktonic-remains-in-millenia-old-mud-reveal-climate-history-of-pacific/,"Researchers with Tongji University in China and Ohio State University, in collaboration with a UCSB professor in the Earth science department, David Lea, have been unearthing layers of prehistoric mud hundreds of thousands of years in the making, with the aim of understanding the climatic history of the tropical Pacific.† Their findings and modeling are documented in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and are part of ongoing research that hopes to understand the effect changes in climate may have on the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A live planktonic foraminifera, Globigerinoides ruber, that the researchers used in the study, for surface waters. Courtesy of David Lea El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a, the colloquial terms for ENSO, are modes that develop in the tropical Pacific, resulting in interannual shifts in temperature. These shifts are caused by a linkage between winds blowing over the Pacific Ocean, and the structure of the Pacific itself.† As Lea put it, ""the idea in this paper is demonstrating that that kind of coupling occurred in the past in a very distinct way. That might have played a role in modulating climate change on these longer thousands of years timescales.""ù ""This study, believe it or not, goes back actually to the early part of the decade in the 2000s ""¶ Basically my role was to share a methodology where we could measure a magnesium to calcium ratio, which tracks with the temperature of the water,""ù said Lea, who pioneered this technique in the 1990s and early 2000s. When microscopic plankton form their shells, the ratio of magnesium to calcium which they incorporate depends on the temperature of the water that they are in. In the 1990s, Lea realized that one could capitalize on this marker of temperature. Researchers could use it to reconstruct past climatic conditions in the ocean, specifically by examining the shells that have sunk down to the seabed layer by layer, over eons. ""Most of my career has been focused on reconstructing climate records from the past. And most of that is focused on deposits from the ocean. The idea is that we can retrieve cores from the ocean, which are basically columns of mud,""ù Lea said.† The researchers collected one such core: MD01-2386, in the Western equatorial Pacific, near Indonesia.† ""The tropical Pacific ""î it's the biggest ocean in the world. It's roughly 50% of the world's oceans. So as a result, the tropical Pacific has the strongest influence on climate variability both on short timescales, and ""î we think as we demonstrate in this paper ""î on much longer timescales,""ù Lea said.† ""There's a really critical, emerging question about how the tropical Pacific will respond to global warming.""ù The most common way for researchers to attempt to address this question is through climate modeling experiments using climate data from the past. This research in particular focused on how the thermocline, the layer of water existing as an intermediate between the sea surface and colder, deeper subsurface of the ocean, changes over a geologic time scale.† ""It's a region of interest because it couples the deep, cold ocean to the warm surface ocean. And that coupling is very, very strong in that Eastern part of the Pacific near Galapagos.""ù The thermocline near the Galapagos is also much shallower than regions further to the west, meaning that changes in depth result in much greater comparative changes in temperature. ""The Eastern and Western Pacific have a very, very pronounced asymmetry. They're very different. If you go to the Galapagos, which is right on the equator ""¶ the water can be quite cold. Whereas in the Western Pacific, you'll find that the water's always warm,""ù Lea said.† Through modeling, the researchers were aiming to better understand how change in the thermocline over time can affect this discrepancy between the warm, Western part of the Pacific and the cold, Eastern part.† Analyses of MD01-2386 ""î and modeling using these analyses as a foundation ""î revealed that the thermocline, over millennia, exhibits much more variable temperatures than the sea surface appears to.† ""There are different ways you can explain that. But one hypothesis would be that the surface responds largely to the atmosphere and changes in the greenhouse effect, whereas the subsurface is changing more due to oceanographic mechanisms such as the [ENSO] phenomenon,""ù Lea said.† ""That there's a greater variability in the deeper waters suggests there's a strong dynamic coupling ""î meaning the way the ocean circulates is changing. The surface is much more regular in its variability, because it's probably responding mainly to atmospheric processes.""ù Now, the researchers plan to test this hypothesis by finding new cores and ""î if their analysis holds water ""î observe how these cores conform to the existing models. ""One of the best tools we have for this kind of research is to try to verify the modes of variability we observe in different parts and different sites,""ù Lea said. However, existing data is already promising.† ""We did make a comparison with the core I'd studied from the Galapagos region early on, and there was some tantalizing evidence, but in an ideal circumstance, what you'd want is multiple records from different sites in the Western Pacific where you could test these correlations.""ù

science,27-Year Monitoring Project Reveals Regional Effects of ENSO on Sea Urchin Settlement,27-Apr-20,8:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-27/27-year-monitoring-project-reveals-regional-effects-of-enso-on-sea-urchin-settlement/,"While studying larval urchins, researchers observed reduced settlement in Southern California and increased settlement in Northern California. Courtesy of Stephen Schroeter Off the coast of California, a long-term sea urchin monitoring project spanning almost three decades has yet again borne fruit, according to researchers with UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute and Florida State University.† ""What we established was a remarkable time series, [a] very high frequency data collection and [one that's] geographically extensive,""ù said Stephen Schroeter, a research ecologist with the UCSB Marine Science Institute (MSI) who has worked on the project since its inception. He is a co-author on a recent paper published in Limnology and Oceanography, working alongside Daniel Okamoto of Florida State University and Daniel Reed, another researcher with the MSI at UCSB. The paper, just one product of the 27-year long monitoring project funded in large part by the California Sea Urchin Commission, evaluated the effects of purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) settlement both during and following El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which are interannual variations in sea-surface temperature and winds centered in the tropical Pacific.† Ranging as far north as Westport, a town in Mendocino County north of Fort Bragg, and as far south as San Diego, the sites ""î with almost no interruption ""î were monitored biweekly, something Schroeter attributes to the ease of data collection.† The study sites ranged from Westport, near Fort Bragg, to San Diego. Courtesy of Stephen Schroeter Inspired by similar sites monitored by researchers working in Japan and the East Coast, Schroeter's team initially conceived the project as a means to monitor enhancement strategies for red sea urchins as a commercial fishery. ""We had sites in Northern and Southern California [originally] to see if artificial settling substrates could enhance the survival of red sea urchins,""ù Schroeter said.† When the researchers conclusively deemed the enhancement ineffective, Schroeter and his peers convinced their backers to continue the project as a ""fishery independent index of stock health.""ù ""That's data that is based on the populations rather than the catch, for example. This is kind of like a canary in the coal mine. [We had] the idea that we could actually see any problems arising from overharvesting, for example.""ù One such finding resulting from the decades-long project was a stark contrast observed in the effects of ENSO events on sea urchin settlement in Southern California and Northern California.† ""Urchin larvae are in the plankton planktonic for one to two months, so that period is fairly long. The settlement we look at is just when they settle out of the plankton. They're very small, about 250 microns, and what we found was that there were differing correlated effects of these large ENSO events,""ù Schroeter said.† In Southern California, researchers observed reduced settlement among baby urchins, while ""the absolute opposite pattern occurs in Northern California,""ù according to Schroeter. This difference observed during the first El Ni√±o events bubbled up again during later El Ni√±os. ""The remarkable thing about it is the repeated pattern. We saw it during the first El Ni√±o events that we looked at in 1992 and 1993 and then subsequently we saw it again,""ù Schroeter said. Examining variables which could come into play during ENSO events allowed the researchers to rule out a number of factors thought to be affecting settlement, including nutrient availability, kelp abundance and the availability of phytoplankton or larval food.† ""There [was] no clear relationship that we could see between phytoplankton availability, for example. The idea was that we were looking at things that might affect the supply of larvae, like populations of adults and the food supply of adults, and kelp is the major food supply for both species,""ù Schroeter said. ""None of those factors explained much of the variability that we saw in settlement.""ù Eventually, they concluded that differing ocean temperatures were the driving factor leading to the different patterns of settlement along Northern and Southern California, with 17 degrees Celsius being the threshold of tolerance for urchin larvae, according to Schroeter. Divers work with monitoring equipment to track larval urchin settlement patterns. Courtesy of Stephen Schroeter Now, Schroeter is looking to corroborate data from purple urchins with data from red urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus), which are closely related. Unfortunately, a relative lack of data is posing a challenge. ""There's a consistent relationship between red urchin settlement and purple urchin settlement, but purple urchin settlement is much higher than red urchin settlement. The ratio is something like 20 and 50 to one. There are a lot of zeros in the red urchin dataset that kind of make it more challenging analytically,""ù Schroeter said.† This paper only represents one finding from data provided by the monitoring project. Over the years, Schroeter and his associates have used samples from cataloged urchins for a number of other studies, including an ongoing project regarding the effects of ocean acidification on urchins.† However, monitoring has been halted at present due to the COVID-19 outbreak.† ""I think our last collection was in March ""¶ There are definite seasonal trends to it, so you tend to get more settlement in the late fall or early winter and then things taper off toward the spring. It may be that we very likely got the settlement signal, but it's hard to say,""ù Schroeter said. ""It could be that this year we might have lost a year. I don't know, we'll just have to see.""ù

Daily Nexus Photo Archives Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, Chancellor Henry T. Yang has announced that UC Santa Barbara will be delivering all in-person instruction remotely. Online instruction is new and challenging for everyone. It is even more challenging to conduct lab classes remotely, as traditional lab classes require professional locations and equipment and need to be conducted under the supervision of an instructor.† One student, a first-year pre-chemistry major, said, ""I feel upset about the fact that I can no longer go to lab class anymore. Lab class was one of my favorite classes to go to.""ù To ensure that students' learning goals are met, UCSB natural science departments are working diligently to find effective ways to provide students with similar learning experiences as in-person classes. Petra Van Koppen, a senior lecturer in the UCSB Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the instructor of the general chemistry lab series Chem 1AL, 1BL and 1CL, described in an email how her lab classes are conducting this quarter. ""Students watch a pre-lab lecture video, take a weekly quiz, watch the experiment video, record data, process data, write up a lab report including their data, their calculations, a summary of results, answers to review questions and a discussion.† Everything is posted and graded on Gauchospace.""ù More specifically, according to Professor Van Koppen, for pre-lab lectures, ""instructional development came to [their] labs to record all the pre-lab lectures and experiments. Students earn Lab Technique Points as follows. They watch the Pre-Lab Lecture video posted on Gauchospace and indicate three important lab techniques covered in the pre-lab lecture that will help [them] obtain good results in doing the experiment and important concepts covered to help [them] understand the results.'' The Lab Technique Points system of the pre-lecture videos has worked especially well for students. According to Van Koppen, Chem 1CL students indicated that ""this is the first time they really understand the concepts and what the experiment is all about.""ù Van Koppen said that the department is planning to have students do similar things next year ""î even if they are back on campus.† However, the instructors are also facing difficulties due to the change in the teaching method. ""Remote teaching is much more work,""ù Van Koppen said. ""TAs and instructors in charge of the lab, feel that holding office hours in person works much better than office hours via Zoom. Although we have more office hours it is much easier to interact and engage with students in person.""ù Meanwhile, unfortunately, several departments had to make the decision to cancel some of their lab classes due to the transition to remote learning. The UCSB Physics department has canceled Physics 4L, Physics 5L and Physics 13CH; the chemistry and biochemistry department has canceled Chem 1AL. JR, a second-year physics minor who was planning to take Physics 5L this quarter, said, ""This is the last class I need to finish the prerequisite of [my] physics minor, so for that reason, my schedule is delayed because of the cancelation of physics lab.""ù Van Koppen explained that the reason for the cancellation of Chem 1AL is that ""in Chem 1AL, students learn many lab techniques, concepts, how to do experiments, and how to write up their lab reports. We feel that Chem 1AL cannot be taught effectively online.""ù Online instruction is a first-time experience for most of the instructors, and many of them are paying close attention to students' responses and needs and are adjusting their teaching method as the quarter proceeds.† ""So far it seems to be going well. Students are feeling good about their experience with the online labs although they miss doing the labs themselves. Several students indicated that they feel the online labs are going much better than they expected,""ù Van Koppen said.†

science,Assessing Sand Demand for a Low-Carbon Transition in Infrastructure,1-May-20,8:00 AM,['Anna Basa'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-01/assessing-sand-demand-for-a-low-carbon-transition-in-infrastructure/,"The transition to low-carbon infrastructure aims to provide a resolution to the ills of climate change, which necessitates alternatives to current insufficiencies within the industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While this movement toward sustainability can be desirable, opting for natural sand does not exempt the resource from putting pressures on the environment. With ecological sustainability in mind, researchers Sangwon Suh, Dimitra Ioannidou and Guido Sonnemann ""î with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management of UC Santa Barbara and L'Institut des Sciences MoleÃÅculaire of the University of Bordeaux ""î aimed to highlight the limitations of a future that implements a low-carbon transition in infrastructure when utilizing natural sand as ""relief.""ù Their research is published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology. While sand may seem abundant and readily available, the usability of certain sand reserves can be deceiving.† Suh, a UCSB professor who has a background in environmental engineering and specializes in industrial ecology, explained, ""You see a great amount of sand on beaches. If you even take a look on campus, we definitely have what may seem to be a lot of it. Typically, people do not see it as a limiting resource and [think] that it is abundant as sea water, but in reality, there is not enough sand for construction purposes. This is not just any sand ""î it has to meet a certain quality to [be usable].""ù Under experimentally projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) in different countries, the researchers estimated the future consumption of sand with the current consumption rates in order to give a value for the historic sand consumption per country. This measurement, along with the sand intensity of construction for buildings and infrastructure, was utilized to create a visual representing the global sand requirements for a 15-year period under the different SSPs, from 2015 to 2030. The graph shows the annual global sand demand projected for 2015""ì2030 under the three SSP scenarios. Courtesy of the Journal of Industrial Ecology The different scenarios in chronological order from SSP1 to SSP3 scale from higher, more aggressive approaches to low-carbon transition to lower, more economically framed GDP estimates for developing countries in the SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. As depicted by the graph, a highly focused global trend toward more renewable substitutes for bitumen and concrete shows a heavy demand in natural sand that only increases.† The research revealed that in comparison to the last 40 years of sand consumption, this projected period of natural sand demand from 2015-2030 requires 500 billion metric tons of sand, which is greater than a twofold increase.† A low-carbon transition within infrastructure would incentivize the minimization of energy expenditures and therefore, carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emission. However, Ioannidou, whose postdoctoral research involves the analysis of resources for natural construction, pointed out, ""The trade-off could mean the depletion of sand in certain regions.""ù This demonstrates that while it is desirable in an ecological sense to utilize sand as a sustainable alternative, the infrastructure demand cannot be properly met by local resources in some regions. Ioannidou explained, ""Implementation in different world regions should be taken on a case-by-case basis, and we should try to see in every region what resources should [be used] from the economy and environment's point of view.""ù† The researchers broke down the sand demand in current extractions compared to the projections for each SSP. These projections may allow industrial ecologists to prevent the overconsumption of a region's natural sand deposits and come to a better understanding of what is needed.† As this research is more visible to the public, Ioannidou emphasizes that the public as well as people in construction must note, ""Planetary boundaries [exist]. We should not go beyond the planetary boundaries in both carbon emissions and the Earth's materials. This awareness is growing within people ""¶ and through this, I believe we can change a lot of things.""ù This research calls attention to the need to develop technologies for sand conservation in the future. The further exploration of such advancements could mean a promising future within low-carbon transition. As Suh put it, ""Low-carbon transmissions and greenhouse transmissions are ""î as soon as this [COVID-19] crisis is over ""î an unmistakable reality that we must face. If we are to cope with climate change, the type of change we need to introduce and the impact of climate change response should be even much more fundamental and should last in the economic structure in the long run.""ù† As the world moves forth past temporary issues, climate change remains a paramount concern for the human race. Suh continued, ""[In our responses to climate change], we need to understand what the implications of such changes [in the world] are, and we should think about the other environmental facts and limiting factors. Low-carbon transition cannot come for free, and it is naive to think this.""ù

science,Gender Diversity and the New Discoveries It Brings to Neuroscience,4-May-20,8:00 AM,['Hannah Hirou'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-04/gender-diversity-and-the-new-discoveries-it-brings-to-neuroscience/,"In the last 100 years, science has made profound discoveries and expanded in all directions. Behind the scenes, however, there has been a silent struggle for gender equality. This has had far-reaching effects.† Courtesy of Frontiers for Young Minds Emily Jacobs is a UC Santa Barbara professor in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences who studies the effects of menopause on the brain as women age. Jacobs recently penned an article in Frontiers for Young Minds to highlight the hurdles that women face in science and to argue that diversity in science drives innovation and can encourage school-aged children ""î especially girls ""î to pursue science.† When Jacobs and I talked on the phone, we chuckled at the fact that neuroscience, in its quest to study the impacts of aging on the brain, has taken so long to consider how menopause affects the brain, as it just seems so obvious to a woman. It illuminates an issue that is common in science and that is the underrepresentation of both female researchers and scientific studies about women.† For one thing, it limits the diversity of researchers that bring their own unique set of questions. It is evident that one's life experience may play a role in the questions that a scientist may ask.† Women have slowly edged their way into the workforce over the last century and science is no exception. In 1927, less than 100 years ago, the Fifth Solvay Conference in Belgium brought together 29 of the arguably most famous scientists of all time. All but one, Marie Curie, were male. Today, the gap has narrowed but still remains large in some areas of S.T.E.M., such as aerospace engineering where less than 12% of tenure/tenure-track faculty are female. Jacobs and I discussed some of the areas that progress could be made. ""Men faculty far outweigh women faculty in S.T.E.M. disciplines, so that's something we need to correct,""ù Jacobs addressed.† Gender bias in S.T.E.M. often goes unseen but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. In one remarkable study, applications ""î identical except for the random assignment of either a female or male name ""î were mailed to hiring lab managers at research universities. Managers were asked to rate the applicant's competence and suggest a starting salary based on the applicants' application materials.† ""They found that the ""òmale' CVs garnered more praise and were more likely to be hired to these lab manager positions. Now, of course the CVs were identical,""ù Jacobs said.† It did not stop there, as the male applicants were also offered greater career mentoring and a higher starting salary. How could this have happened to identical applicants with the exception of the only difference of a male or female name?† ""It's these biases that exist at every stage of the game. It makes it way more difficult for a woman to succeed in an already hypercompetitive world ""î not because she's not worthy, but because the chips are just stacked against her,""ù Jacobs went on. It raises the question: Where are our women and why is there not an even distribution in S.T.E.M.? It is a deep question society must ask itself. Perhaps the answer may lie in how children are raised. When it comes to this, there is no doubt a difference that gender plays in the psychology of youth.† Jacobs expressed her own frustrations from one experience she had with her young daughter in a toy store in Boston.† Jacobs recounted, ""I was floored at what I saw ""î shirts that said ""òI'm A Princess' were on one side and ""òI'm A Genius' on the other side [for boys]. And actually my small moment of anarchy was just to take a rack of those clothes and just swap them.""ù Gender stereotypes such as these can profoundly shape the course of a young girl's life if she believes that she doesn't have the capability to study math and science due to a lack of intelligence. Interestingly, in one study by Lin Bian, a psychologist at Cornell University, children between the ages of five and seven were told to point to who they thought was more intelligent, a man or a woman. At the age of five, the children tended to point to their own sex but the six- and seven-year old girls were more likely to point to the man.† †While it is unclear why this shift happens, the same study also found that girls who thought that men were smarter began avoiding games that are described as being for ""really smart kids.""ù Potentially, it is ""those internal biases that we have that affect children's choices and it can all propagate from if girls opt out of taking robotics classes or playing math games. These things can just grow with time,""ù Jacobs said.† Gender stereotypes such as these can profoundly shape the course of a young girl's life if she believes that she doesn't have the capability to study math and science due to a lack of intelligence. In a traditional upbringing, girls are often conditioned to be submissive.†† ""You say ""òyes,' ""òplease' and ""òthank you,' you have good manners, you don't question authority, you don't develop a healthy skepticism and that's what science requires,""ù Jacobs mused.† She went on to add another interesting point, ""You have to be willing to read an article and tear it apart, talk about what was good but also recognize what was bad and I think there is a certain sort of hubris involved with being able to do that.""ù† So how could underrepresentation of women affect science and neuroscience? ""Even within the disciplines themselves, the questions that we ask don't serve women equally,""ù Jacobs said.† She shared a personal example of her quest to study the effects of menopause on the neurology of brain aging that, ""as it turns out, [shape] the brain in these really interesting ways.""ù† Menopause is an event where a woman's hormones change as she stops menstruating, usually between the ages of 45 and 55. It is often a huge transition in a woman's life. Previously, no one had made the connection that it may play a role in Alzheimer's, a disease in which a disproportionate number of the patients are women.† ""Why is it 2020 and we are just now getting a handle on how there may be sex-specific trajectories on how the brain ages and [how] that can be really important for understanding why, for example, two-thirds of the Alzheimers disease patients are women? ""¶ It comes down to who's asking the questions,""ù Jacobs stated.†† There are other pivotal cases of the impact gender can have on science. For instance, rodents are often used in research to model the human body and can be noted as another glaring example of how gender has negatively impacted the discoveries of science. Until the work of Annaliese Beery, who reported in 2010 that male animals were predominantly used in neuroscience research, ""it was assumed that, due to the menstrual cycle, females were too ""òvariable.' But that was an empirical assumption that never went tested until a follow-up study by Brian Prendergast,""ù Jacobs stated.† In the end, the study proved that this assumption was, in fact, wrong. ""It just goes to show you that we have these cultural assumptions, like that the menstrual cycle makes women ""òcrazy' and it makes us all ""òvariable.' That is not actually true and you have to test your assumptions,""ù Jacobs explained.†† Overall, it seems like bad science to neglect data collection on an entire gender, regardless of the variables. Due to Beery's work, there has been a national movement for government-enforced policy to include female animals in research studies.† Thankfully, the future appears bright for women as more diversity is gained throughout all fields of S.T.E.M., bringing with them new discoveries and innovation.

science,"Red Tide, Blue Waves: Bioluminescence in Southern California Beaches",6-May-20,9:00 AM,['Leon Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-06/red-tide-blue-waves-bioluminescence-in-southern-california-beaches/,"This bioluminescence, caused by the phytoplankton Lingulodinium polyedra, occurs annually during springtime. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons With water that is a murky brown by day and a brilliant electric blue by night, many beaches in Southern California have been reporting bioluminescent waves crashing against the coastline.† The phenomenon was first detected off of Scripps Pier in San Diego on March 25 and has gradually spread north ever since, eventually reaching Santa Barbara beaches at the end of April.† This bioluminescence, caused by the phytoplankton Lingulodinium polyedra, occurs annually during springtime as surface waters are abnormally warm as a result of rainfall. These organisms utilize the light-emitting compound luciferin to generate brief pulses of light as a natural defense mechanism to frighten predators. Luciferin is used across the living world by several bioluminescent organisms such as fireflies, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. L. polyedra comes from a specific class of phytoplankton called dinoflagellates, which make up the most common source of surface water bioluminescence, according to the Latz Laboratory at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Dinoflagellates are single-celled protists that predominantly reside in marine environments. Algal blooms that result from the dramatic increase of dinoflagellate counts in certain areas are commonly referred to as red tides, which are known to deplete coastal waters of oxygen and release neurotoxins that destroy marine life and can be toxic to humans, according to National Geographic. However, the bioluminescent dinoflagellates responsible for generating Southern California's blue glow do not produce harmful toxins, allowing many surfers to paddle out to the bioluminescence and observe it up close. Variations in nutrient concentrations and hydrographic conditions may lead to a red tide event. In many cases, a red tide can reach a density of over 20 million dinoflagellates per liter of seawater, according to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Red tides are almost always composed of the same species of dinoflagellates, such as the L. polyedra that produce bioluminescence.† Researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography explained the phenomenon on a molecular level. Marine biologist Michael Latz used an atomic force microscope to pinpoint the trigger for the bioluminescence: a small pressure force exerted at a high stimulation speed. This explained how disturbances such as waves or a breaching animal would yield a luminescent response, but gentle forces like wind and ocean currents often go unnoticed.† In Isla Vista, the bioluminescence is best seen around Devereux Beach, located just past the end of the 68 block of Del Playa Drive. The algae is most visible a couple hours after sunset, when the last traces of sunlight have subsided but the surface water has yet to cool down completely. A surfboard or kayak may be needed to go far enough offshore to see the spectacle.

science,Experiments With Drosophila Flies Raise Questions About Function of Opsins,9-May-20,8:51 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-09/experiments-with-drosophila-flies-raise-questions-about-function-of-opsins/,"Opsins, once thought to be light-dependent proteins, have been observed operating in a number of different sensory faculties in Drosophila flies ""î a phenomena which is spurring more and more research questions.† The researchers used behavioral assays to gauge the Drosophila melanogaster fly's attraction or repulsion to particular foods. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons A paper, authored principally by Nicole Leung, a former doctoral researcher with UC Santa Barbara's Montell Lab, and published in Cell, describes one light-independent chemosensation function of opsins in detecting and relaying signals from aristolochic acid, a plant-derived bitter compound. Leung began doctoral work on the project in Dr. Craig Montell's lab during Summer 2016, having worked in the lab since Spring 2014. ""The most significant [finding] is that opsins detect chemicals and does not require light or the chromophore to do so,""ù Leung said.†† While the paper is the first demonstration of the role opsins play in chemosensation, prior research by the Montell Lab and others have ""shown roles for opsins in other Drosophila sensory systems, such as temperature sensation, hearing, and proprioception,""ù according to Leung.† These recent developments are remarkable. For over a century, opsins have historically been observed operating in rhodopsin, a light receptor. Their ever-broadening role, then, is a paradigm shift of sorts for the existing scientific literature, according to Leung.† ""Work done in the Montell lab [previously] found that sensation of a bitter chemical called aristolochic acid required protein components that overlap with the visual system.""ù† Those components comprise a signaling cascade which converts sensory information into electrical signals that the neurons are able to carry to the brain. In Drosophila, three types of opsins, Rh1, Rh4 and Rh7 are observed being used to sense aristolochic acid.† The researchers made use of Drosophila flies as a test subject in the neuroscience research, using behavioral assays to gauge their attraction or repulsion to particular foods. Two dining options were laid out: a sweet, sugary one which would attract flies, and a bitter one which flies would avoid. ""Drosophila is a great study subject for many fields of biology and particularly for neuroscience. The genetic tools that have been developed and are available for use to manipulate genes and particular populations of neurons are extremely powerful to understand precisely the function of those genes and neurons.""ù ""We found that flies with mutations for certain opsins avoided the bitter option less, meaning that they show deficits in avoiding the bitter option. This led us to investigate further whether opsins are important for detecting bitter chemicals,""ù Leung said.†† Alongside this, the researchers made use of electrophysiology, allowing them to record neurons on the tongues, or labellums, of their oblivious insect subjects. When flies were subjected to the bitter option, the researchers would detect electrical signals from particular neurons.† ""However, when we did the same recordings with flies that lack certain opsins, they show significantly less electrical impulses, suggesting that opsins in these neurons are required for bitter chemical sensitivity.""ù A significant difficulty encountered during the research was finding a method to reliably detect opsin proteins present in the fly tongue. It was discovered through other methods that the levels of opsins present on the tongue are notably low.† ""[We] had minimal success. We think this is also a biological/physiological phenomenon to prevent light from interfering to opsin's function to detect chemicals.""ù Due to the fact that opsins need to carry a chromophore, a chemical component and a derivative of vitamin A, in order to detect light, Leung believes the argument could be made that the original purpose of opsins is in chemical detection. This is a claim which is further supposed by the fact that the opsins in question didn't need to be coupled to a chromophore in order to detect the chemical. ""The most significant [finding] is that opsins detect chemicals and does not require light or the chromophore to do so,""ù Leung said.† While Leung graduated from UCSB in June and has since moved onto a postdoctoral position at Stanford University, the Montell Lab continues to conduct research regarding the different functions of opsins. Recently it has published a paper centered on another opsin which appears to play a role in ""combining sweet sensation and cold temperature sensation,""ù as Leung puts it. In that study, Drosophila have been observed exhibiting differing neural responses to sugary food depending on the temperature, with sugary food perceived as less ""palatable""ù during slightly cool temperatures. A rhodopsin, Rh6, is the culprit.† ""We are hoping that our work will catalyze more studies of opsins that are expressed outside of the eye, e.g. brain, heart, skin etc. so that we can have a better understanding of light-independent functions of opsins.""ù

The seminar is the third of the UC Santa Barbara's interdisciplinary COVID-19 Webinar series, ""Issues, Approaches, and Consequences of the COVID-19 Crisis,""ù sponsored by UCSB, Novim and Cottage Health. Measuring uncertainty with confidence intervals, in IMHE model. Courtesy of Yu-Xiang Wang.  The speakers of the seminar were Professor Ambuj K. Singh and Assistant Professor Yu-Xiang Wang, both from the UCSB Computer Science department.† Professor Singh started the seminar by looking at some lessons from three historical epidemics, including the cholera outbreak in 1854, the Spanish flu in 1918-1919 and the Ebola outbreak in 2013-2016, to understand how data and models in the past have informed people's decisions.† More specifically, Professor Singh mentioned that scientists ""[were] able to do contact tracing""ù back in the cholera outbreak in 1854.""ù He also stated that ""the prediction was 10 times worse than what actually happened""ù during the Ebola outbreak and that through the analysis of Ebola models, people found that the error was caused by the fact that ""human behavior changed at a much faster rate than what the models predicted.""ù After a discussion from the historical aspect, Professor Singh introduced three features of COVID-19 datasets: heterogeneous, uncertain and dynamic.†† According to Professor Singh, COVID-19 datasets are heterogeneous in the sense that ""the risk factors vary at the level of a single person, a country or a region based upon geography, culture and the human element.""ù ""Testing errors are there, we are not certain about what is the rate, what is the dynamics of the disease itself.""ù For example, how long does it take for someone to heal? That is ""hard to gauge,""ù said Professor Singh. Lastly, Professor Singh mentioned, ""COVID-19 datasets are highly dynamic in the sense that there are frequent tightening and loosening of interventions, change of behavior and the disease dynamic itself changes at the level of a single person or the level of the population.""ù In the last part of Professor Singh's talk, he shared his personal point of view on the steps that need to be taken before reopening the campus. First, ""we need to make [sure] contact tracing works on campus. We can ask students, staff and faculties whether they want to be a part of it, and people who opted in will be using a phone app or a manual system to trace their contacts.""ù† On top of contact tracing, Professor Singh added, ""We need to be doing three things: We need to have a network in which we can predict, and we need to have a system for testing, and we need to build a way of [treating] people that have fallen sick ""î and we need to have alternate plans if things don't work out. If we can make those three things happen, it is feasible a campus like UCSB can open.""ù After Professor Singh finished his part, Professor Wang took over for the remainder of the seminar. Professor Wang first presented the graph ""Measuring uncertainty with confidence intervals, in the IMHE model,""ù pictured above. The red solid line ""comes from the actual realized history. We are plotting the number of death[s] per day.""ù ""From this point onward, the shaded area is the forecasting that is made under the IMHE model about what is going to happen in the future,""ù Professor Wang explained.† ""Luckily, we can see that we already passed the peak, and if the model is predicting correctly, we will see a steady decline of the number of death[s] per day, and, hopefully by June, everything will be settled, and we will no longer have any additional cases in COVID-19.""ù Professor Wang also presented a graph of the ""Predictions of SB cases with fitted SIR model.""ù The green line plots the actual cases in Santa Barbara County, and the blue and yellow lines are predictions from two different methods. The shaded blue area marks the range interval. † Prediction of Santa Barbara COVID-19 cases with fitted SIR model. Courtesy of Yu-Xiang Wang. Professor Wang closed the seminar by quoting George E. P. Box, saying, ""All models are wrong, but some are useful.""ù  ""Obviously, we can never really model the world exactly, but the actual measure of whether a model is useful or not is by how much impact this model [has] in terms of decision making and how we can quantify the usefulness of the model,""ù Wang said.† ""As in today, for decision-making purposes, we should make decisions in ranges rather than based on a single number,""ù concluded Professor Wang.

Courtesy of Yitian Shao Yitian Shao, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and lead author of a paper published in Science Advances, is asking questions about how the mechanism the hand employs in producing mechanical signals relates to the sensation of touch.† With the use of an apparatus, the researcher and his collaborators captured the tactile signals of various common actions as the vibrations from these reverberate across the entire hand. ""[Through] this research, we find that the anatomical biomechanics of our hand actually plays a role in efficiently encoding the tactile signals that facilitate our perception of touch,""ù Shao said in an interview.† When the hand comes into physical contact with an object, this contact produces mechanical waves, which manifest in the form of skin vibrations. These vibrations propagate from the original point of contact outward.† ""Based on this mechanism, we design or customize a device that consists of many extra accelerometers, which are basically sensors that can pick up the vibration of the skin,""ù Shao said.†† The result of this was a device which consisted of 30 vibration sensors and which were attached to the hands of the participants in their initial study. These sensors all possessed ""a frequency bandwidth overlapping the entire human tactile frequency range.""ù Participants were equipped with the device. The researchers then asked them to perform a number of ""everyday hand interactions.""ù For each interaction, Shao and his collaborators obtained data on the vibratory responses to each particular interaction, which were measured through observed skin vibrations. These observations were compiled in a large database, and initially were used to review the ""distribution of the types of signals in the hands,""ù Shao said. ""In this current paper, we focused more on the analysis of the technical information ""¶ to extract the fundamental structures of the type of signal.""ù† The researchers did so by using a dimensionality reduction model ""î lowering the number of random variables at play while assessing the information ""î to simplify the dimensionality of the signal caught and transcribed by the sensor. These lower dimension representations of the signal still managed to return much of the tactile information. Pictured above are the dynamic spatial patterns of the representations of tactile signals captured by the apparatus. Courtesy of Yitian Shao ""We can use this information to classify the hand detection and still achieve a relatively high classification rate of 95%,""ù Shao said.† The representations served as ""efficient encoding mechanisms""ù and spatially correlated to the anatomical structure of the hand. It was found through further analysis that the representations also accurately showed the ""physics of the wave mechanics in the skin.""ù ""This result actually suggests that the skin biomechanics actually may play a role in efficiently encoding the type of information in your hands. That's a major discovery of the paper,""ù Shao said.† The model used to lower the dimensionality of the signal draws its lineage to other models developed by researchers studying photoreceptors in the eyes, which similarly are tasked with stimulating the process which turns light into something interpretable by the brain.† Now, with data from the two previous papers to work with, Shao and his collaborators are developing new normal haptic feedback devices to reproduce the tactile sensations in the hand. However, doing so is proving difficult.† ""I'm actually facing many challenges because of the complexity of the tactile signals and also like I mentioned, we found in the prior research that the skin biomechanics, the biomechanics of hands actually play a complex role in shaping the types of signals,""ù Shao said.† Ultimately, Shao anticipates that these findings will add to a growing body of knowledge employed in the development of novel tactile sensing devices. ""Those devices can be used, for example, for prosthetic limbs, for people that are amputees, or it can be used or developed to have normal sensing technology for robots, especially humanoid ones,""ù Shao said.†† Comments are closed.

science,Goleta Beach Water Quality Deteriorated After 2018 Montecito Mudslide Cleanup Efforts,16-May-20,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-16/goleta-beach-water-quality-deteriorated-after-2018-montecito-mudslide-cleanup-efforts/,"During the Montecito mudslides in January 2018, intense rainfall precipitated a deluge of mud and soil runoff to create a devastating debris flow affecting Montecito and nearby communities. Investigators took regular samples as the sediments were being disposed of during 2018. Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus As part of the mudslide cleanup effort, the sediments were transported to several places, including Goleta Beach, for beach nourishment. Concerns were raised with regard to this emergency response and its potential effects on the environment, as high fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations were detected in the sediments. Significantly elevated fecal bacterial levels in the ocean water resulted in the closure of Goleta Beach for six months. UC Santa Barbara researchers from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and the Earth Research Institute examined the possible impacts of the sediment disposal on the water quality at Goleta Beach. Their findings are published in Water Research. ""The risks of sediment disposal for human health were unknown when sediments were disposed of on Goleta beach,""ù Dong Li, the lead author of the paper and a postdoctoral researcher in environmental microbiology Professor Patricia Holden's lab, said in an email. The investigators took regular samples of the beach sediments and surf zone water while the sediments were being disposed of continuously onto Goleta Beach during January and February of 2018. With these samples, they intended to investigate the source of the fecal pollution as human or animal and evaluate potential public health threats. The scientists analyzed the samples for FIB, pathogens, the bacterial community composition and DNA fecal markers that would reveal the source of the fecal matter. Their testing confirmed that the increased FIB concentrations in the sediments and surf zone were due to sewage contamination ""î perhaps to be expected, since damaged sewer pipes and septic systems in houses had released human waste. ""The concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria detected in the surf zone water matched well with the predicted level based on the input from sediments disposed of on the beach,""ù Li stated. The disposed beach sediments deteriorated the surf zone water quality and altered the surf zone microbiology temporarily. In their samples, the researchers detected DNA sequences of intestinal bacteria, including numerous possible human pathogens able to exist in soil or water. Most of the bacteria would not have been harmful to beachgoers, according to Li.† ""However, if there were human pathogens in sediments, they might be able to survive in the environments for a while, so if people [did] swim in the surf zone, they might inhale some pathogens and get infected,""ù Li said. After around 10 days since the initial sediments were deposited on the beach, microbial contamination decreased greatly, according to Li. The surf zone water quality improved, likely from the ocean currents bringing in fresh nearshore waters to the area. FIB concentrations also continued to drop after sediment disposal ceased. Approximately three months later, they returned to 2017 levels. ""The combination of several microbial detection and source tracking methods such as fecal indicator bacteria, human and animal fecal DNA markers, and microbial community sequencing [were] very helpful to reveal the human or animal sources of fecal contamination, and further evaluate the potential microbial risks for human health when such [a] natural disaster happens and a lot of urban disaster waste needs to be cleared,""ù Li said. For many years, the Holden Lab has been studying the water quality of Goleta Beach and other coastal waters. Li and the other members are continuing to monitor the local water quality. Currently, the lab is beginning wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in the Santa Barbara region.††† Numerous partners enabled the team to conduct their research at Goleta Beach, including UCSB's Coastal Fund, the California State Water Resources Control Board, the Montecito Sanitary District, Heal the Ocean and the California NanoSystems Institute.

science,The Economics of the COVID-19 Crisis with Peter Rupert,18-May-20,7:00 PM,['Anna Basa'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-18/the-economics-of-the-covid-19-crisis-with-peter-rupert/,"In a shared effort, UCSB's interdisciplinary research centers, Novim and Cottage Health have begun a lecture series, ""Issues, Approaches, and Consequences of the COVID-19 Crisis,""ù to offer insights into the scope of the virus's impact in various fields of study. The sessions convene on Tuesdays from 1 to 2 p.m. via Zoom and extend until June 9.† The May 5 session, ""Economic Aspects of the Crisis: Labor Markets During Pandemics,""ù featured Professor Peter Rupert, executive director of the UCSB Economic Forecast Project and associate director of the UCSB Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance.† SARS-CoV-2 (yellow) emerges from the surface of cultivated cells. Courtesy of NIAID-RML Rupert began the seminar by citing an article from The Wall Street Journal, speaking to humanity's collective lapse of memory of past pandemics. ""The Hong Kong virus killed over 100,000 people and more than a million in the world,""ù Rupert said, explaining that there was no sense of urgency to take proper precautions back then. ""[There were] people attending Woodstock in 1969, there was no shutdown and the pandemic lasted about three years; one of the things to note is how these things can respread.""ù† In highlighting a history of neglect in pandemic responses, he brought to light how the current COVID-19 crisis is no different.† Pointing to contrasting mortality rates from Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Jay Bhattacharya, a lead researcher in vital COVID-19 studies being done in Santa Clara and Los Angeles Counties, Rupert said, ""I want to caution us all, at the end of the day we know very little [about the science behind COVID-19] and we certainly don't understand much of the economics.""ù† Presenting two projections from early March, Rupert reported that, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), Americans would lose 19.8 million jobs by the end of June 2020. In contrast, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis believed that there would be 47 million jobs lost. This projected range of unemployment, according to Rupert, averages to somewhere between 10 to 40% ""î not sufficient to predict the future of the economy. ""The economics is all over the map, and as I mentioned, as scientists aren't quite sure what the mortality rate of this disease is, we are not quite sure what the repercussions will be [in the economy] as a result of the pandemic. This is not a standard recession.""ù† The shockwaves of this virus have indubitably illuminated the ill-preparedness of the U.S. to respond to pandemic crises. As a reminder of statistics that are indicative of arduous economic periods, Rupert explained that, ""The unemployment rate at the peak of the Great Recession was about 10% and during the peak of the Great Depression was about 25%, but the difference is during the '20s, the Great Depression stayed within this range for around 10 years.""ù† Offering his expertise and calculations from his most recent paper, he later explained, ""When we simulate the model to U.S. data, if there is no government intervention, total unemployment rises to 10% to 35% with quarantine.""ù† Compartmental epidemiological standards like the S.I.R. model provide a foundation for virologists to better track and structure the progression of pandemics. This mathematical bookkeeping of people is an arrangement which categorizes people as susceptible (S), infected (I) or recovered (R), and functions to show the spread of a disease. To translate this information properly into economic terms, Rupert introduced the Mortensen-Pissarides model for unemployment to the S.I.R. model for infectious diseases to estimate the effects of COVID-19 on the labor force in his most recent research.†† His calculations indicate that ""quarantining works, but we can do better if we somehow impose a tax on the infection and consider it a negative externality. We are thinking of taxing businesses on vacancy creation to stop businesses from hiring people [and furthering the spreading of the disease]. Incentivize businesses to stay home and make money.""ù More literature related to this can be found under the research tab on his website. The state of emergency initiated by the crisis has left grocery store shelves barren of goods like flour, yeast and toilet paper. Encompassing the dire state of the American economy, essential goods are running low and people are increasingly becoming unemployed. He revealed that, in March, 3.3 million people applied for unemployment insurance. ""[The amount of people applying for initial claims] are going up by the millions and we are now up to 26 million people.""ù This has already surpassed the projections of the EPI as we creep up toward the projections from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Projected job losses for California, Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo County. Courtesy of Peter Rupert With quarantine forcing many businesses to close temporarily, many cannot sustain themselves with no customers for prolonged periods of time. As a result, Rupert exclaimed, ""A third of all businesses will close. In fact, many local restaurants on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara will likely close if this quarantine continues until the end of the summer.""ù† During times like these, it is easy to underestimate the implications of figures on a screen. But, as more problems manifest as a result of the pandemic, people are losing not only their lives but also their means to live. During a later interview with the Daily Nexus, Rupert explained, ""The disease has preyed on the most vulnerable and has always posed a predatory position to those who are immunosuppressed. But, it also targets those who are most financially vulnerable.""ù† He continued, ""40% of women with children under 12 are facing food insecurity""ù and ""all the people who were making lower wages are increasingly losing their jobs, causing the average wage of the working class to go up.""ù These statistics are just a few among the many that indicate harsher ends as the virus spreads.† There can be no resolve to the financial collateral of quarantine without obtaining information about where the virus is spreading and what the rate of infection is moving toward. Without this knowledge, humanity is playing a guessing game. As a remedy to diminish the scourge of the virus, a crucial step in all of this is to get adequate testing. Rupert emphasized that ""solving the first problem to this virus remains a common ground in medicine and economics. We need testing.""ù This virus is testing the tact of humanity and our institutions, and without proper attention to its demands, we risk lethal economic and medical consequences.† ""As epidemiologists say that we need to flatten the curve, we also need to flatten the economic curve,""ù Rubert said.

science,"Partisanship, Racial Politics, Public Health and the Planet",21-May-20,8:10 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-21/partisanship-racial-politics-the-public-health-and-the-planet/,"An environmental sociologist at UC Santa Barbara, Ian Carrillo, has been studying how race and the politics of race play into environmental policy.† Carrillo's paper, published in Current Sociology, seeks to add another dimension to the debate in environmental sociology between two competing frameworks which have dominated the conversation for decades: the treadmill of production and ecological modernization. In 1982, the people of Warren County, North Carolina protested against a toxic PCB landfill; these protests are seen as a watershed moment in the environmental justice movement. Courtesy of Ian Carrillo The treadmill of production describes a perpetuation of the status quo, wherein ""capitalism and unfettered markets lead to environmental destruction,""ù while ecological modernization posits a different road taken, where capitalism can be reconciled with sustainability measures through the transformation of the markets and technology. ""One of the things I felt was lacking from this debate was the issue of racial politics, which I thought became, it became clear just how important that was in the 2016 election,""ù Carrillo said.† Following the 2016 election, President Donald Trump's administration has promptly rolled back on numerous environmental regulations, weakened the Environmental Protection Agency, challenged the capability of states to set their own environmental regulations and exited the Paris Climate Accord.† ""There's a lot of interesting, I think, opportunities for cross pollination across these disciplines to study, you know, environmental issues.""ù ""We see the environmental consequences of these sorts of trends, as the [Trump] administration subsequently gutted environmental and climate regulations and appointed judges who will undoubtedly stymie environmental regulations for decades.""ù† Enter the racial fix.† ""The racial fix refers to the idea that race and racism are mechanisms for circumventing barriers that foster ecological stability, like climate change mitigation policies or other environmental regulations.""ù As Carrillo describes, the racial fix plays out along three dimensions: spatial, political and cognitive. Spatial, fittingly, refers to space and geography. Sociologists have long been interested in the geographic relationships which arise when one looks through the lens of race. As it pertains to the racial fix, Carrillo describes the impact of segregation, through legislative, historical and economic phenomena which inform environmental issues.†† ""Scholars have done really good work over the last 30 years documenting how environmental inequalities follow racial and spatial patterns, with communities of color, disproportionately facing toxic exposures.""ù A historical example of this is the Texas city of Austin, where city planning documents detail how segregating the city racially led to just that. ""They basically said, ""òLook, if we segregate our city racially, and we put all Hispanic residents in one, you know, one side of town that enables us to then put all of our waste storage facilities on that part of town too, because it's politically expedient.'""ù† ""And these authentic communities don't have the political power to resist.""ù Political, another dimension, refers to issues of race and representation in American politics, especially as white voters make up a smaller and smaller chunk of the electorate and they increasingly adopt policies that aim to empower themselves and deny political power to other voters.† Carrillo listed off a number of methods, such as gerrymandering, voter restrictions, false claims of voter fraud, census manipulation and the invalidation of key sections of the Voting Rights Act.† ""So this is part of a long-standing tradition of racial conservatism in the U.S. that has been hostile to fully incorporating people of color as equal participants in democracy,""ù Carrillo said, adding that ""you've started to see these really intense arguments in favor of electoral college that you didn't see, five years ago, 10 years ago.""ù Third, Carrillo's cognitive dimension looks at how racial identity plays into voting behavior, and how politicians capitalize on this. In particular, the ""spillover of racialization""ù has turned any partisan issue into a racial issue, according to some research.† ""Research found that highly visible symbols of racial progress, such as the presidency of Barack Obama, primed racial attitudes among conservative voters, as they interpreted his policy achievements through a racial lens,""ù which according to Carrillo, bled into the broader political conversation. ""[Other research] found that racial resentment and not economic anxiety was the best predictor for whether someone would cast a vote for Trump.""ù These factors all play into one another, however, spatial segregation underpins everything, Carrillo says. With spatial segregation, people don't have to confront the reality that they live in a shared world, ""and it creates this impression that we don't have shared problems.""ù† Some sociologists have even argued that this separation is the most ""pernicious""ù type of racial discrimination, because once that happens, segregation extends to ""almost every other dimension of life,""ù Carrillo said.

science,Having Vivid or Bad Dreams During the Pandemic? You‚'re Not Alone,22-May-20,9:00 AM,['Jacqueline Wen'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-22/having-vivid-or-bad-dreams-during-the-pandemic-youre-not-alone/,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, we've had to navigate through new challenges in all aspects of our lives. These added stressors are taking a toll ""î even on our sleep. Many people are reporting greater disrupted sleep, ranging from vivid dreams to nightmares to insomnia. In stressful times we may be likelier to have nightmares and remember our dreams because of their greater vivid nature. Marcello Frisina / Daily Nexus ""At the most simplistic level, everybody's schedules are really disrupted with online classes and people working from home ""î just the typical routines of getting up at a particular time and going through the activities of daily living have been really disrupted,""ù said Steve Smith, an associate professor and director of clinical training in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology. These disturbances can include basic changes in our sleep schedules and self-regulation that disrupt sleeping and dreaming patterns.†† The phenomenon of unusual sleep experiences during the pandemic may be due to ""emotional overloading,""ù according to Smith, who teaches the course Sleep: Biological, Psychological, and Artistic Perspectives. ""Everybody is really going through a tough time. It's a lot of emotions and feelings to process. And of course, that's going to spill over into our dreaming life, too.""ù Smith, a licensed psychologist with a private practice in Santa Barbara, stated that many of his therapy patients are describing remembering their dreams more and having more nightmares. He pointed out that everyone dreams, but whether or not we remember them ""ì or how much we remember ""ì can vary from person to person. The amount we dream remains roughly the same each night. In stressful times we are not dreaming more, although we may be likelier to have nightmares and remember our dreams because of their greater vivid nature. From a scientific perspective, it's not clear why we dream. However, we do know that dreaming is vital for our survival. ""If you prevent a mammal from dreaming, it will die eventually,""ù Smith said. Further, ""there is reason to think that dreams are important in memory consolidation and helping us make sense of our daily experience,""ù Smith remarked. ""I think dreams are essential because they help us regulate our affect and cope with the stresses of our daily life. It does seem to be our minds' way of processing information from the day and consolidating that information in a way that we can make use of.""ù The mind seems to worry at night in the same way that it worries during the day, according to Smith. While asleep, the brain's language parts are less active. But the imagery and visualization parts are still up and running, explaining why our worries and thoughts manifest themselves in ""more symbolic""ù and ""less linguistic ways.""ù So how attentive should we be to our dreams? ""I think by paying attention to our dreams we can have a clearer sense of some of the things that bother us even if we're not fully consciously aware of them during our waking life ""¶ But that said, in a life full of stress and anxiety, if you've got stressful and anxious dreams, I don't know that they are telling us that much more new information that we don't have already other than maybe some of the particular things that we might be worried about,""ù Smith said. The importance of sleep cannot be overstated. Under the idea that most healthy adults require eight hours of sleep a night, Smith uses the example of sleeping seven hours per night for 10 nights in a row. By losing an hour of sleep for 10 consecutive days, ""you're doing as well as somebody who's legally drunk [in terms of cognitive functioning].""ù Getting inadequate sleep can impair our ability to learn and problem solve, as well as to cope with our emotions and stress. It can even jeopardize our physical health, as we become more prone to sickness and injury. For better sleep, one should consider factors such as food allergies, which can increase the chance of having nightmares. More broadly, practicing good sleep hygiene can boost our general quality of sleep, reduce nightmares and improve our overall mental and physical well-being. This includes keeping a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed at the same time each night and waking up at the same time each morning. Other good sleep habits are to avoid screens at least 30 minutes before going to bed or using blue light filters, and not to exercise or eat before going to bed.†† Smith also cautions against prolonged use of sleep medication, which can reduce dreaming in ""rapid eye movement""ù or REM sleep, when most of our dreaming occurs. ""There's not very good evidence that melatonin does much of anything other than to make you feel a little more sleepy, but it doesn't necessarily help you sleep,""ù he said. ""I would urge people, especially student-age kinds of people, to avoid [long-term use of] sleeping medications and other drugs that might facilitate sleeping. I think that that's not good for overall health in the long run.""ù Comments are closed.

The sessions convene on Tuesdays from 1-2 p.m. via Zoom and extend until June 9.† The May 12 session, ""Social Scientific Insights to Attitudes, Policies, and Coping with the Crisis,""ù featured Professors Heejung Kim, David Sherman and Robin Nabi.† Researchers at UCSB have been hard at work studying the societal consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. Strict limits on indoor capacity are a very visible reminder that daily life has been upended. Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus The first of three lecturers, Kim, a professor in UCSB's Department Psychological & Brain Sciences, described her evaluation of Americans' xenophobic attitudes and tendencies in response to an increasing pandemic threat.† ""Xenophobia is defined as fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or anything that is strange or foreign ""¶ some scholars find [an] association between disease and xenophobia.""ù Including past infectious diseases like the bubonic plague, cholera and yellow fever, Kim highlighted the fact that each pandemic has been associated with a particular group of outsiders. ""There is nothing unique [to] COVID ""¶ at the social level people worry about keeping people outside and filtering their own group,""ù she continued. As time went on and more cases of COVID-19 appeared, there was a pattern in Americans that manifested, ""in psychology, the Pathogen Prevalence theory, states that living in pathogen prevalent locations make people more xenophobic.""ù ""Anti-semitic, xenophobic vandalism found on floor of east campus [at ], there was more generalized sense of xenophobic anti-semitic and anti-immigrant sentiments, et cetera,""ù she continued.† Kim scrutinized the† psychology underpinning this phenomenon and introduced her current research which questions, ""When people experience acute, severe and urgent threat: What happens to xenophobia? Do people become more xenophobic? If people become more xenophobic who increases in xenophobia and how do they become more xenophobic?""ù† Kim described her evaluation of Americans' xenophobic attitudes in response to an increasing pandemic threat. Courtesy of Heejung Kim Using graphs that controlled for age, gender, education, income, ideology and ethnicity, she presented two graphs which visualized the relationship between xenophobic thoughts and xenophobic policy. Kim examined these two facets of xenophobia over a period of time from February 2020 to March 2020 ""î the time COVID-19 was †only a distant threat in the United States and the time when it became an urgent threat (the country's first stay-at-home orders were put in place then), respectively. In the second part of the lecture, Sherman, another professor in UCSB's Psychological & Brain Sciences Department, addressed how politicians and experts influence policy support with specific regards to the coronavirus.† Briefing American responses to pandemics in the 20th century, he introduced a study written by prominent psychologists Irwin Rosenstock, Godfrey Hochbaum and Howard Leventhal around coordinating and understanding the government and public response to the 1957 Asian Influenza. ""The Impact of Asian Influenza on Community Life: A Study in Five Cities""ù was a book that relayed the approaches taken by government officials in different countries, including the U.S., anticipating the spread of the disease.† ""I was struck by how the national experts coordinated and executed a plan ""¶ Politicians, governors, played a limited role in the public announcements and behind the scenes planning. They're mentioned but did not play a prominent role in communicating to the public what is needed.""ù† Sherman indicated, ""This idea [of politicians not being at the forefront of pandemic response] is part of the Centers for Disease Control's epidemic handbook and communication during a medical emergency.""ù†† He described the impact of the party over policy effect in American politics, ""A liberal policy will be favored by conservatives if it is said to have been proposed by republicans. A relatively stringent policy will be accepted by liberals if it is said to be proposed by democrats.""ù In a large online sample, his research group introduced two policies about the future of COVID-19 governmental response.† The study introduced people to two different policies, one centered on public health that emphasized maintaining shelter-in-place and social distancing for an extended period of time, and the other a more economic and public health focus that had a shorter time length for shelter-in-place and social distancing. The experiment monitored policy support from people for both policies in relation to the qualifier it was given ""democratic, republican, bipartisan or expert support.""ù† The study introduced people to two different policies, one centered on public health and the other with a more economic focus. Courtesy of David Sherman The statistics concluded that people are most receptive to information from experts. Partisanship and bipartisanship are surpassed in credence by science.† Sherman stated a quote by Dr. Richard Besser of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""If you have a politician on stage there's a very real risk that half the nation is going to do the opposite of what they say,""ù he said. ""We observed that in our experimental results.""ù† Nabi, a professor in UCSB's Department of Communication, was the third and final lecturer. Her presentation centered on ""Coping with COVID-19 Stress; Media use, coping efficacy, and social distancing.""ù Interested in effective models to manage stress, Nabi named many of the numerous by products of the COVID-19 pandemic, ""fear of illness, social and physical distancing, financial strain, relational strain, schedule disruptions, supply chain disruptions, enhanced uncertainty and anxiety""ù to isolate and recognize the problems people may face. Nabi's current research conducted a survey in the interest of understanding individuals' stress and coping strategies as a result of COVID-19. She specifically looked into how this manifests in media use in contrast to other strategies, such as problem-focused strategies, used to address external problems like handwashing or emotion-focused strategies like meditation, used to decrease anxiety. The first survey was conducted on 564 U.S. adults across the country, from March 20-24 this year, at the initial point of transitioning into social distancing.† ""A lot of people are turning to media [use] to help themselves cope,""ù she commented. In the data collected during the survey, the reported No. 1 coping strategies for people shows a visual difference in the frequency of media use in comparison to the emotion and problem-focused strategies. Nabi examined how media consumption has been used as a coping strategy in the wake of the pandemic. Courtesy of Robin Nabi A statistical analysis was run on the associations of activities to reacting to stress from COVID-19. ""What is the frequency of consumption of different types of mediums to cope with COVID?,""ù she questioned. According to Nabi, the data collected suggested that people turn to media usage in higher volumes than other coping strategies. According to another correlative model, ""the more stressed people are the more they are watching television and movies, the more they're listening to music and the more healthy they are eating,""ù Nabi said. ""Stress and coping efficacy related to one another on a negative basis,""ù however what she believed was imperative to note was that TV, movies and other media usage had an indirect relationship in helping people feel as though they were coping better with stress. Nabi concluded with a few key takeaways. ""There is a vast range of content that we can use to regulate our moods and escape and in this digital age,""ù she said. ""There is value in news. When used in coping to obtain information, it can be a very valuable resource.""ù†

science,"UCSB Researchers Investigate the ‚""Untapped Gold Mine‚""ù of Wastewater Testing for COVID-19",28-May-20,10:30 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-28/ucsb-researchers-investigate-the-untapped-goldmine-of-wastewater-testing-for-covid-19/,"Researchers with the Holden Lab, based in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara, are in the middle of processing wastewater samples with the goal of detecting the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Dr. Patricia Holden (left) and Laurie Van De Werfhorst (right) Courtesy of Laurie Van De Werfhorst The team has been provided samples from the El Estero Water Resource Center, located in Santa Barbara, and the Montecito Sanitary District's treatment plant, located in Montecito. The Holden Lab has received funding from the Coastal Fund, a branch of Associated Students, to cover the costs of this project from mid-April to the end of June.† Through this, the lab aims to understand not only the current circulation of the novel coronavirus, but also project what capacity must be built in the future to combat a potential second wave, according to Laurie Van De Werfhorst, a senior staff scientist who's worked with Dr. Patricia Holden for almost 19 years. ""If we're able to detect ""î hopefully quantify,† but at least detect ""î the virus in wastewater, we can monitor that quantification over time and see if it's increasing or decreasing. It might predict when that second wave of infection will happen,""ù Van De Werfhorst said. ""If it works, [we] might be able to inform the public before you start seeing increased numbers of positive test results.""ù However, with many lab operations put on hold in the wake of the pandemic, processing and analyzing samples is a bit more complicated than it would be normally. Only one researcher has clearance to physically work in the lab: Dr. Holden.† Due to this, Holden and her team have only been able to collaborate remotely. Van De Werfhorst has been assisting Holden with logistical tasks from outside the wet lab, such as locating equipment and providing Holden with standard operating procedures regarding how one must process the wastewater samples. ""The idea is all sorts of viruses are in that wastewater sample. You pour it through a filter and on that filter you're trying to capture cells. And on the filter, you go through an RNA extraction kit because you want to extract the RNA from those cells that we've captured on that filter,""ù Van De Werfhorst said. ""It extracts the RNA from the cells, it purifies it, cleans it up and at the end, you have a small tube of RNA that you can then use different types of analyses to detect or quantify different targets that you want,""ù such as, in this case, SARS-CoV-2.† The researchers are acting alongside others around the world who have looked toward the informational ""untapped gold mine""ù of wastewater in their efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.† The Holden Lab, in addition to attending summits and seminars regarding sewage surveillance and COVID-19, has also been in direct communication with researchers in the Bay Area, Michigan, Nevada and Massachusetts, as well as private companies monitoring and sampling municipal wastewater. This practice, known as sewage surveillance, has been employed to track the presence of opiates and other chemicals through wastewater previously. Now, scientists are using it to track COVID-19 as it courses through the population.† ""The Netherlands published a preprint paper where they were proactive and able to sample their wastewater treatment plants before any cases had been documented in their country,""ù Van De Werfhorst said. As more detection of the virus was observed in wastewater, there was a similar increase in positive cases reported in the community. ""So, that's sort of a proof of concept. It seems to be working, there seems to be an association between the number of detections you're having and the number of positive cases in the community.""ù Wastewater monitoring could also potentially be used to better understand the efficacy of public health safety measures such as social distancing, as well as how the spread of COVID-19 may be heralded by the presence of the virus in wastewater. ""In California, we're staying at home as much as possible, but things are starting to be lifted, and as they're lifted, we might be able to see a difference in the detection rate or the quantities of the virus,""ù Van De Werfhorst said.† ""People shed the virus and start heavily shedding the virus, you know, one or two days before they're symptomatic. So if you're already shedding the virus before you show symptoms, that's going to be entering the wastewater stream.""ù The ultimate goal for the Holden Lab is to prepare the community for forecasted future outbreaks. Courtesy of Patricia Holden This isn't the first time the Holden Lab has volunteered its efforts for the sake of the community. For years, the lab has monitored the water quality of the surf zone off of Goleta Beach, East Beach and Santa Barbara Creek looking for indicators of human fecal pollution. During another natural disaster, after the 2018 Montecito mudflows, the Holden Lab approached the Coastal Fund in search of emergency funding; with this, they were able to sample sediments dumped onto Goleta Beach through the beach sand and the surf zone in order to monitor for contaminants. This pilot study was eventually published.† ""Most of the research that I've been focused on involves water quality [and], in particular, microbial source tracking,""ù Van De Werfhorst said. ""We have a history of local water quality research as well as working with wastewater treatment plants and working with those samples. We're always looking for ways to help the community with our knowledge and expertise.""ù When laboratory research ramps back up again, Van De Werfhorst is certain that lab practices will be different to accommodate social distancing and other guidelines. How different they will be is still an unknown, although the researchers will likely have to add lab surfaces like door handles and communal equipment into the equation. Meanwhile, while they await the slow return to normalcy, Holden and her colleagues will continue chugging along, diligently perusing their samples in search of the virus. If all goes well, they'll be able to map out the prevalence of COVID-19 in time for fall quarter, at which point additional funding will have hopefully allowed them to continue their project.† ""If we show during this initial April to June study that we're able to detect frequency or quantity correlators associated with the number of positive cases in the area, then that makes it a strong tool to start monitoring,""ù Van De Werfhorst said.† ""We could start taking samples again, measuring and then if we start to see increases, we can contact public health and say, ""òwe're starting to see the virus""¶ you may want to impose stricter guidelines to the public or just to let them know. Maybe you need to start increasing your capacity for testing or for hospital beds or medical treatment,' that sort of thing.""ù Comments are closed.

Actual serotonergic fibers in a mouse cerebral cortex (left bottom) compared to simulated FBM fibers (top right). The cookie shape in the center shows the distribution of FBM fibers inan idealized shape with a varying border curvature. Courtesy of Skirmantas Janusonis Serotonin, perhaps best known for contributing to feelings of well-being and happiness, is a neurotransmitter responsible for a broad swath of processes in the brain and the body. The serotonergic matrix ""î a network of thin fibers present everywhere in the brain with ""mind-boggling density""ù ""î governs where it goes. ""It's an ancient system; all vertebrates have that matrix, it's not just mammals, not just humans, but all vertebrates ""î going back to fish ""î they have this matrix,""ù said Skirmantas Janusonis, an associate professor in UCSB's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences.† ""As we all know, serotonin is involved with things like major depressive disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and many other conditions. Not to mention wakefulness and sleep, emotion regulation and some other [processes] that""¶ contribute to our own well-being.""ù Janusonis has been researching the serotonin system for much of his career, delving into its anatomy and the anatomical distribution of serotonergic fibers, among other things. Now, he's looking deeper into the development of the serotonin system itself.† A new paper by Janusonis, published in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, details the use of modeling through fractional Brownian motion to create predictive ""descriptions and manipulations""ù of the serotonergic matrix and the density distribution of its fibers across the brain.† Brownian motion mathematically describes simple diffusion, the process of random motion which governs particles suspended in fluid, like when a sugar cube dissolves in water. But fractional Brownian motion adds another layer to the math.† ""Brownian motion essentially says that each of my moves is completely independent of the other moves,""ù Janusonis said.† In contrast, ""fractional Brownian motion says that my path is not just where I am now, or that my next step solely depends on this step; it depends on all the previous steps that I've made. And that sounds very simple, but mathematically, it makes it quite complex ""¶ these are biological things which tend to maintain the direction they started with; however there is still a big random element.""ù Janusonis was intrigued when he encountered research from Thomas Vojta, a physicist at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, whose findings in applied physics appeared to mirror what Janusonis and his collaborators were observing in the serotonergic system.† Vojta's paper detailed a phenomenon observed in the superdiffusive or persistent regime of fractional Brownian motion ""î in which the trajectories generally stick to the direction they began with ""î where these densities would accumulate at a border. ""So if you have something that is closed and it has a boundary or border, those trajectories will accumulate at that boundary,""ù Janusonis said. Janusonis contacted Vojta, and, endowed with funding for their pilot study from the California NanoSystems Institute at UCSB, began a collaboration using supercomputing simulations to model fiber densities and attempt to approximate these distributions in the real physical brain.† The matrix of serotonergic fibers in the basal nuclei of the mouse brain, important in cognition and motor function. Courtesy of Skirmantas Janusonis ""In this paper, we looked just at the geometry of the brain. What is the shape? Simply forget all these nuclei, forget what they do, forget layers, nuclei names, all of that; look at the shape.""ù ""The remarkable aspect of that was just by going with a shape from this kind of pure mathematical perspective, we could actually recover densities that one sees, or at least approach the densities that one sees in the actual brain,""ù Janusonis said.† Given this, according to Janusonis, one may conclude that the shape of the brain itself, including its curvature, may influence the density of the serotonin fibers.† The flexibility of fibers is another interesting aspect of the system that can become useful from the
biomedical perspective, in observing its influence on the development of some disorders associated with
the serotonergic system, according to Janusonis. Now, Janusonis and his graduate students, Melissa Hingorani and Kasie Mays, have been advancing experimental research in an experimental capacity in order to examine the value of fractional Brownian motion in different regions and conditions in the brain. ""[That research is] specifically focused on looking at some disorders in the brain. Being able to predict what will happen and how we can control that would be [extremely] useful,""ù Janusonis said.

science,Advancing Green Chemistry With Professor Adeyemi Adeleye,9-Jun-20,10:05 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-09/advancing-the-principles-of-green-chemistry-with-professor-adeyemi-adeleye/,"Although avoiding polluting should be a primary goal of any industry, there are many processes and practices ""î not to mention accidents like oil spills ""î which inevitably will result in pollution.† In these circumstances, pollution remediation is often the best way to hand a crutch to a contaminated site on the long walk to recovery. However, there are even issues with remediation itself.† ""The goal of remediation is to regain that clean, pristine, safe environment, right? That's what we desire. But that comes at the cost. The cost could be straightforward money you need to pay someone for the procedure, or the cost could also be environmental,""ù Adeyemi Adeleye, a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at UC Irvine and an alumnus of UCSB, said. On June 1, the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management invited Adeleye onto Zoom for an online seminar titled ""Green Chemistry Approaches for Improving the Sustainability of Pollution Remediation.""ù† Adeleye spoke on two particular ways that his graduate students have been developing methods and processes to improve remediation and mitigate these costs with green chemistry.† According to Adeleye, the EPA defines ""green chemistry""ù as the ""design of chemical products and processes to reduce waste or eliminate the generation of hazardous substances.""ù Oftentimes, this means finding different ways of doing things to decrease the associated hazards of a process.† There are 12 principles of green chemistry; Adeleye and his students focused on two, aiming to ""design chemical products that are fully effective yet have little or no toxicity""ù and ""use renewable feedstocks,""ù which are the raw materials used to fuel an industrial process.† In regard to the former principle, a student of Adeleye, Ziwei Han, has been developing methods to reduce the toxicity of arsenic, a contaminant found in groundwater.† A schematic diagram showing nanoscale zerovalent iron and the mechanism of arsenic remediation.†Courtesy of Adeyemi Adeleye Some methods to address the problem of arsenic in water have included things like bioremediation, using microorganisms and plants in order to sequester arsenic and soft washing with acids, but both of these have problems.† ""The plants that can actually cause sequestration of arsenic cannot grow everywhere,""ù meanwhile, acids ""directly [impact] organisms. And when you wash with acids or bases, you can also wash all that very useful nutrients from the soil,""ù Adeleye said.† Instead, Han looked into nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI), which can be used to immobilize arsenic in soil. Specifically, Han wanted to learn how one could better nZVI's performance in remediation by reducing solubility and reactivity.†† ""When the [nZVI] accepts a contaminant like arsenic upon its dissolution, it can release what it has already absorbed previously""¶ The second problem is that it can adjust the pH of the soil. So, if there are organisms that cannot tolerate large change in pH, they would be negatively impacted. Last is that it can increase the iron concentration in water,""ù Adeleye said.† The researchers modified nZVI with the aim of preventing reactions from occurring which contribute to nZVI's toxicity, and studied the effects of these modified particles over four weeks.† ""Between week one and week four, the amount of arsenic that can be leaked is decreasing compared to increasing without any modification,""ù Adeleye said.†† ""So, we think this modified material is not working as fast as the unmodified work but on a long-term basis, it may be more promising in that arsenic that has been immobilized will not be remobilized because this particle is more chemically stable.""ù Then, the researchers looked into how the modified particles affected other life forms, namely earthworms, and observed that the toxicity appeared to be reduced. However, Adeleye admitted that another experiment looking at just the pH of the soil and the survival rate of the worms would be beneficial data to have.† The second project, led by a graduate student in the Adeleye Lab, Omobayo Salawu, looked into alternatives to the use of conventional activated carbon in adsorbing organic contaminants.† Photo ""a""ù shows raw shrimp shell, which is then ground and pyrolyzed. Photo ""b""ù shows the ground shell under an electron microscope. Photo ""c""ù shows the small volume pores of a shell which received further treatment via activation. Courtesy of Adeyemi Adeleye Activated carbon, despite being seen as a standard for adsorption, has a number of issues. It is made from charcoal and often sourced illegally from countries with weak or poorly enforced environmental regulations. Activated carbon also lacks ""specificity,""ù according to Adeleye.† ""It's a cross-spectrum adsorbent and in general, water treatment plants are trying to remove contaminants that are present at very low concentrations. So they need to use a lot more activated carbon than is really needed, because there is competition between a low concentration of the contaminant and other things that may be present at a much higher concentration,""ù Adeleye said.† Shrimp shells seemed like a good candidate for use as a renewable feedstock in adsorbing contaminants, ordinarily being a waste product which could be diverted from a landfill and also being plentiful with largely little to no competition for use.† Crushing the shrimp shells resulted in carbon with good physical properties for carbon removal, having high surface area compared to conventional activated carbon and also nitrogen, the presence of which researchers noticed increased the absorption of target contaminants. In promising experiments with ciprofloxacin, a common pharmaceutical found in biosolids, they found that ""for every gram of the activated carbon we use, we removed about six to 0.66 grams of ciprofloxacin,""ù Adeleye said. ""To put it into context, it is very high.""ù† Comments are closed.

science,The Remarkable Recovery of the Channel Island Fox,13-Jun-20,6:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-13/the-remarkable-recovery-of-the-channel-island-fox/,"Halfway-submerged sections of the mighty Transverse Ranges, the Channel Islands lay just off the coast of Southern California. They're visible from almost anywhere along the south-facing Central Coast. In Isla Vista, if one peeks out over an oceanside balcony or walks along the beach, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands dominate the horizon.† An Island fox with a radio collar on San Clemente Island, the southernmost of the Channel Islands where Sanchez currently works. Courtesy of Jessica Sanchez The islands themselves are home to an incredible diversity of life. Under the waves lay vast kelp forests, while on land, oak woodlands are interspersed between chaparral, grasslands and even two relict stands of elusive Torrey pine. Most charismatic, perhaps, are the foxes. ""They're definitely very clever and mischievous, but they also have a kind of fearless confidence that comes with having been a top predator for so long. They will come right up to you,""ù said Jessica Sanchez, a wildlife biologist, veterinarian and epidemiologist at UC Davis.† Sanchez has been working with the Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis) since 2006, when she joined in the efforts to repopulate the fox populations following a rapid decline which brought the species to the brink of extinction.† In the late 1990s, the foxes were on a precipice. On Santa Catalina Island, an epidemic of canine distemper virus ""î likely introduced from the mainland ""î killed 95% of all the foxes on the island by 1999, while up north on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands, invasive golden eagles began feasting on the foxes in large numbers. ""The eagles were [initially] attracted to the islands because there was an abundance of livestock like pigs and goats for them to feed on. There were also open territories that were left because the native bald eagles had also been declining at the same time due to DDT,""ù Sanchez said. DDT, a chemical originally developed as an insecticide, is infamous for thinning the eggshells of many birds, particularly birds of prey. It is now banned in the United States.† Unfortunately for the foxes, their fearless nature and diurnal lifestyle made them easy targets. Better yet, they were the perfect size to be scooped up and brought to nests as a nutritious meal for infant chicks.† ""They didn't really have a lot of the evasive behaviors that mainland foxes have so they really suffered predation by these eagles and that just led to dramatic population declines,""ù Sanchez said.† Because of the different causes of decline, conservationists needed their recovery efforts to have a multi-pronged approach. For one thing, golden eagles would have to be extirpated from the islands. In order to drive them away, non-native ungulates, which the golden eagles preferentially preyed on, would have to be removed for good. Concurrently, work began to reintroduce bald eagles to the islands to occupy their former territory and drive away any wayward golden eagles that were inclined to return. Meanwhile, in order to jump-start their recovery, programs for captive breeding and furthering the† long-term monitoring of the foxes became established all across the archipelago. ""When we brought animals into captive breeding to protect them from whatever the external threat was, they actually bred really well in captivity ""¶ So the distemper outbreak ran its course and we started vaccinating foxes against it, [while] with the golden eagle threat, we were able to physically remove them and alter the landscape,""ù Sanchez said.† The Santa Barbara Zoo, for instance, became very involved with island fox conservation and recently brought two orphaned foxes, Lewis and Clark, to the zoo. In 2006, when Sanchez began working on the northern Channel Islands with the Institute for Wildlife Studies, a captive breeding program had already been successfully established; however, threats from golden eagles still persisted. Over the next few years she was working there, Sanchez got to observe firsthand the foxes' remarkable recovery, with the release of the final animals in the captive breeding program on the northern islands and a transition to solely wild population monitoring and management. ""The foxes were listed as critically endangered ""î on some islands there were only 15 foxes and all of them had been brought in from the wild into the captive breeding facilities,""ù Sanchez said. ""And we went from that to a fully wild and recovered population by 2016, when the three northern islands were delisted, which has been reported as the fastest recovery of any mammal listed under the Endangered Species Act.""ù† Now, for many conservationists working with the foxes, the focus has shifted to the next stage in recovery, with the restoration of native plants and the further removal of invasive vegetation introduced through decades of ranching. Perhaps eventually, the ecological balance that existed before human occupation will return.† Meanwhile, Sanchez herself is studying strategies for epidemic prevention and detection in the event that another disease resurfaces. In fact, the Santa Catalina foxes are still labeled as near threatened due to the high tourist traffic that the island receives, compounding the risk of another disease outbreak.† In her latest research, Sanchez simulated the various strategies used to detect and prevent rabies and canine distemper virus with a spatial model. Working with data from foxes on San Clemente Island, Sanchez has scoped out the efficacy of preventative measures like vaccine firewalls and randomly distributed vaccinations in relation to population density.† ""Pathogen transmission seems to happen faster when there's a higher density of foxes, which has been shown with a lot of other populations. So we're trying to figure out, given a high or low density, where the pathogen is introduced, what type of vaccination distribution is going to be the most effective?""ù Sanchez said. ""My hope is that our findings will allow managers to identify those guiding principles that they can then take and interpret based on their particular island's geography and fox population.""ù† Comments are closed.

science,The Differences Between Us: Disparities in American Healthcare,22-Jun-20,11:55 PM,['Leon Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-22/the-differences-between-us-disparities-in-american-healthcare/,"A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that ""among 580 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with race/ethnicity data, approximately 45% were white, 33% were black, and 8% were Hispanic, suggesting that black populations might be disproportionately affected by COVID-19.""ù† There is disproportionately low accessibility to healthcare among people of color. White individuals are three times as likely to be insured than Hispanics and twice as likely as African Americans. Courtesy of Alterio Felines / Pixabay COVID-19 appears to target minority communities because of its increased lethality for those under poor economic or social circumstances. In large cities such as New York, ethnic minorities may live in more densely populated zones as a result of housing segregation. This makes it much more difficult to follow social distancing procedures, resulting in a death rate for African Americans which is double that of white folk, as reported by the New York Times.† Moreover, many ethnic minorities in the United States are incarcerated at disproportionate rates compared to their share of the population in detention centers and prisons, where shared facilities and denser populations contribute to a steeper COVID-19 death toll.† Certain minorities also suffer increased exposure to COVID-19 due to their increased prevalence in riskier work environments. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 25% of Hispanic and Black laborers are employed in essential industries, as compared to 16% of white laborers. Additionally, Hispanic workers endure reduced access to paid sick leave, which may encourage infected laborers to continue working despite presenting a risk to their coworkers.† On a related note, as The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) describes, there is disproportionately low accessibility to healthcare among people of color. White individuals are three times as likely to be insured than Hispanics and twice as likely as African Americans.† This reflects an age-old inconsistency of resource distribution that stems from institutionalized racism.††† According to infographics released by U.S. Vital Statistics, almost 300 more Black individuals die compared to whites within a sample size of 100,000 people in the 50 to 64 year old age group. Within the same age group, 18% of Black individuals were unable to seek medical assistance due to cost compared to 12% of whites.† In an effort to reduce the inequities, the U.S. federal government has arranged national programs designed to deliver healthcare to disproportionately affected African Americans. One such program, Million Hearts, is a national initiative that implements priorities to prevent one† million strokes and heart attacks within the span of five years. This is achieved by providing more affordable and effective diagnoses of hypertension and cholesterol management procedures to more people, particularly those that are in underserved communities.† Healthy People 2020 is another government program that promotes the well-being of all people by supporting healthy social environments. This initiative focuses on mending the five† determinants that cause underlying health disparities, namely economic stability, education, social and community context, healthcare and neighborhood environment. Healthy People also tracks factors that affect the distribution of healthcare, including graduation and unemployment rates.† These efforts have since made a noticeable impact on diminishing inequities. The CDC reported in 2017 a 25% decrease in the African American death rate in the past 17 years, especially among those 65 and older.† Positive trends like these are not atypical. The percentage of uninsured Hispanic adults dropped from 24.4% in 2013 to 14.4% in 2018, according to Xtelligent Healthcare Media. For Black individuals, the 40.2% of uninsured patients dropped to 24.9% within the same time span.† Research published by the CDC and NCBI have demonstrated an upwards trend; minority health disparities are shown to have diminished steadily over the past decades. Though achieving completely equitable healthcare is an uphill battle, medical professionals are optimistic that future generations will benefit from efficient healthcare delivery regardless of ethnic backgrounds.† Comments are closed.

Peach studied C. unguiculata for all of her time as a Ph.D. student at UCSB, focusing on the ecology and evolution of reproductive traits in the species.† In this particular research study, published in Frontiers in Plant Science, Peach sought to examine the effects that particular conditions correlated to climate have on the floral reproductive traits of the wildflower, such as temperature and solar ultraviolet radiation. ""I was not really interested in ultraviolet (UV) floral patterns until 2015 when I read a paper published by Dr. Matt Koski and Dr. Tia Lynn Ashman in Nature about how solar UV can shape the evolution of UV floral patterns,""ù Peach wrote in email correspondence to the Nexus.† ""Evolutionary biologists consider the diversification of flowering plants to be primarily driven by a combination of variation in abiotic and biotic conditions, so decades of research preceded my work on this topic.""ù† Susan Mazer, Peach's advisor, has used Clarkia as a study subject for 15 years, conducting research into the effects of environmental stress on the ""form and function of wild plants,""ù as well as correlations observed between climate and the geographic distribution of traits seen in plants.† With Clarkia specifically, Mazer found in previous studies that populations and related species which were adapted to hotness and dryness developed faster, flowered earlier, made smaller flowers, produced seeds earlier and were more likely self-fertilized compared to those in colder and wetter settings. ""The large geographic range of Clarkia unguiculata provides a mosaic (a lot of unique combinations of climate and geography) in which to study the factors associated with the evolutionary diversification of floral traits beyond the traditional plant-pollinator framework,""ù Peach said. ""Latitude is often used as a proxy for solar UV, temperature, and precipitation,""ù Peach said. However, there are some things which complicate the relationship between latitude and those attributes which use latitude as a proxy.† As one approaches the equator, solar UV radiation increases. However, as one goes up in altitude, solar UV radiation also increases.† ""So locations at high elevations may experience a similar amount of UV [compared] to low latitude locations regardless of their latitude. A very basic example of this would be to think about how sunburned fair-skinned alpine hikers/skiers get at high elevation mountain tops that are in relatively high latitude locations,""ù Peach said. In California, the influence of recurring coastal fog is also a complicating factor, introducing longitudinal variation as one travels east inland from the coasts.† ""So latitude is an imperfect proxy for solar UV,""ù Peach added† To rectify this, Peach looked at the effects of these ""abiotic factors""ù in a way in which they could be observed untethered from latitude. She and her collaborators quantified several floral traits in populations raised in greenhouses. Altogether, these populations represented eight wild populations of the flower, spanning a wide breadth geographically. These traits included floral pattern size, pollen performance and anthocyanin concentration ""î anthocyanin being a flavonoid, which are compounds created in response to environmental stressors, as well as used to ""produce flower colors to attract pollinators,""ù Peach said.†† ""In support of our predictions, populations of C. unguiculata characterized by high solar UV conditions were associated with higher mean floral anthocyanin concentration than those in low UV conditions.""ù However, the researchers also observed effects contrary to what they anticipated. For instance, higher UV had a negative effect on the area of the UV nectar guide, the nectar guide being the indicators on flowers which ""guide""ù pollinators.†† ""To our knowledge, this is also the first study to describe the presence of UV-absorbing floral patterns (nectar guides) in C. unguiculata,""ù Peach said.† ""In this study we found that intraspecific variation in floral color, pattern, and size is geographically structured and that several components of climate (and topography) explain a significant proportion of variation in these traits. However, only some of the geographic patterns reported here are consistent with those observed in other species.""ù In particular, the concentration of anthocyanin and the size of the nectar guide did not influence pollen performance in any light treatments used in the study, according to Peach. The study is helpful in establishing a baseline for the mechanisms used by the flowers which are dictated by climate in the long term. With humanity embarking on a slow march toward a warmer world, such a baseline will become much more useful as C. unguiculata finds itself forced to adapt, Peach believes. ""The changes in climate predicted for North America in the coming decades will alter the selective pressures that influence the evolution of floral traits in wild populations,""ù Peach said.† ""Gaining a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which plants have responded to a range of selective scenarios in the (relatively) recent past can broaden our knowledge of evolutionary processes and inform estimates of how populations and species may respond to long term changes in climate and landscape.""ù Comments are closed.

science,"Researchers Reconstruct Oceanic Nitrous Oxide Emissions, Revealing Intriguing Patterns",6-Jul-20,9:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-06/researchers-reconstruct-oceanic-nitrous-oxide-emissions-revealing-intriguing-trends-and-cycles/,"Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas with about 300 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. Emissions from the ocean comprise about one quarter of the total nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere. The researchers drew from 158,000 measurements across the world ocean, capturing variation in latitude as well as coastal ""hot spots.""ù Cameron Hsieh / Daily Nexus This is not at all an insignificant source of emissions, yet despite the potency of nitrous oxide, there are enduring gaps in knowledge regarding the timing and distribution of its emissions. Consequently, this has made research into the atmospheric nitrous oxide budget difficult. Now, however, some of these gaps are being filled.† Alyson Santoro, a professor with UC Santa Barbara's Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology has been working on the subject of oceanic nitrous oxide for more than a decade, most recently contributing to a global reconstruction of nitrous oxide emissions.† This piece, written in collaboration with a smorgasbord of other researchers from across the world, was published in the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences. In the past, Santoro has worked to determine the primary source of oceanic nitrous oxide, researched the abundance, diversity and activity of organisms which contribute to nitrous oxide emissions in the central California current and investigated the ebb and flow of nitrous oxide in eutrophic estuaries like Chesapeake Bay. Santoro and her collaborators also formerly measured nitrous oxide on monthly expeditions in the Santa Barbara Channel, a project which initially began with funding from the UCSB Coastal Fund. However, just like other long-term monitoring projects, these local measurements have been put on hold due to the pandemic.† Nitrous oxide emissions in the ocean result from biological and physical processes. Much of it comes from microbes in water who convert ammonium into nitrate. This process, called nitrification, generates nitrous oxide as a by-product.† In the global ocean, one finds that nitrous oxide is distributed unevenly, with tropical regions comprising the bulk of emissions. The reason for this disproportionate contribution to emissions has to do largely with upwelling. ""[Nitrous oxide] is produced in the dark regions of the ocean, below where sunlight reaches. Its main pathway to the atmosphere is when deep water is brought to the surface by physical processes, known generally as upwelling,""ù Santoro wrote in email correspondence with the Nexus. ""The equator is a major upwelling region in the ocean.""ù Those in California might be more familiar with the effect that upwelling has on sea surface temperatures. The Golden State, bordering on the edge of the Pacific, experiences upwelling in the springtime. This water, rich in nitrous oxide, is hoisted up from the depths of the ocean and contributes to cooler surf.† This phenomenon, aptly named coastal upwelling, also applies in equatorial regions, wherein winds blow towards the equator following the ""[eastern] edges of the ocean basins,""ù according to Santoro.† Armed with 158 thousand measurements of nitrous oxide from the surface ocean ""î the researchers trained a supervised learning algorithm to reconstruct nitrous oxide emissions, capturing both latitudinal variation as well as coastal ""hot spots.""ù Regarding the source of these measurements, Santoro stressed the necessity of drawing from particular locations in order to best understand how nitrous oxide emissions can change, and that places like the tropical and subtropical open ocean, where measurements are generally focused, do not necessarily lead to the most representative results.† ""The coasts are also really important. But, they are also ""messy,""ù meaning that the way water moves around the coast is complex and things change [rapidly], so you may have to make a lot of measurements before you understand how things work,""ù Santoro said. With this, they were able to reduce the uncertainty plaguing previous estimates more than fivefold, and discerned an average nitrous oxide flux of 4.2 trillion grams of nitrous oxide emissions per year, equating to one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. ""The amount of [nitrous oxide] naturally coming out of the ocean has a global warming potential about 20% of the annual US [carbon dioxide] emissions,""ù Santoro said.† However, just as illuminating to Santoro and her collaborators was the cycle nature of emissions which revealed itself to them.† Nitrous oxide emissions peaked in the boreal summer. Conversely, emissions reached their lowest point in the spring; Santoro attributed both of these to the seasonality of the processes which govern emissions, namely ""seasonal upwelling in the tropical ocean and winter mixing in the Southern Ocean.""ù† ""Just as biological and physical processes on land are seasonal, the equivalent processes are seasonal in the ocean.""ù In the wake of climate change, the source of this seasonal variation, namely tropical upwelling,† becomes concerning.† ""As the ocean warms due to human-induced""¶ climate change, the difference between the surface ocean temperature and the deep ocean temperature gets bigger,""ù Santoro said.† If nitrous oxide emissions from the ocean are sensitive to changes through this ""anthropogenic stratification,""ù and thus respond to changes in climate, as the reconstruction suggests, the impact to the ocean from climate change will be greater than merely warming seas.† ""[Climate] change doesn't just mean that the ocean is getting warmer. It means that fundamental properties of the ocean ""î like the way water moves around ""î are also changing,""ù Santoro said.† ""Cycles we are just barely beginning to understand, like El Nino, could be changing as a result of these circulation changes, which can have ripple effects for all kinds of things like the biology and chemistry of the ocean.""ù† ""Our story about [nitrous oxide] is just one small example of this.""ù

science,"With Face-to-Face Interaction on Pause, Videoconferencing Offers Effective Behavioral Intervention Programs For Those With ASD",13-Jul-20,2:00 PM,['Anna Basa'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-13/with-face-to-face-interaction-on-pause-videoconferencing-offers-effective-behavioral-intervention-programs-for-those-with-asd/,"Researchers with UC Santa Barbara and Stanford University, publishing with the Hammill Institute on Disabilities in SAGE Journals, conducted a study on the effectiveness of videoconferencing as a way to implement remote intervention programs for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. As results from the study indicate, remote instruction can accomplish many of the things that ""face-to-face""ù treatment can. Courtesy of Pixabay Led by Katerina Ford, a doctoral student in education with an emphasis in special education, disability and risk studies at the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education at UC Santa Barbara, this study conveys the importance of remote accessibility to behavior facilitating programs. Others integral to the study include UCSB researchers Mian Wang and Andrew Fedders, as well as two researchers from Stanford University, Robert L. Koegel and Lynn Kern Koegel. According to the study, in recent years there has been a growing number of people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a result of this increase, there are calls to find alternative formats to current in-person programs or on-site videoconferencing (VC) programs, which are less convenient for people who may not have sufficient resources in their community, lack a means of transportation or face other obstacles which currently limit their access to such programs. Background data collected in studies previous to this one shows that, ""[people] with autism spectrum disorder display significant challenges with daily living services (DLS) relative to their cognitive abilities,""ù according to the study. This data was imperative to note while conducting this study as the researchers aimed to ""focus on interventions that ameliorate these challenges.""ù Currently, there are options like telemedicine programs, which utilize VC intervention as a means to ""facilitate positive adaptive behavior outcomes""ù in individuals with ASD but only offer it via computers on site, requiring extra effort and coordination. This is the first study on utilizing VC through remote intervention within the homes of individuals with ASD. The researchers considered ""money management, personal hygiene, and meal preparation as essential to independent living and employment.""ù These DLS can include daily activities ranging from maintaining bedroom cleanliness to cooking on a stove.† The three participants in the study came from a demographic of young adult males with average intelligence who were diagnosed by clinicians with ASD. Each individual in their daily lives demonstrated reliance on their caregivers or support staff to complete specific DLS.† The design of the study employed a ""multiple baseline criterion""ù which was essentially a tiered progressive system that encouraged advancement and retention of the participants' skills based on a gradually growing scale.† For each participant, target DLS were chosen, as well as a five, seven or nine-step hierarchy baseline design. Over a period of time, the participants were asked to do the target DLS once as a baseline before the VC intervention, then again while being given the VC intervention and then a third time weeks after the completion of the intervention. Each multi-phase plan was tailored to each of the men according to what they, their guardians or their support staff reported as target DLS that needed intervention. The result comparison to the baseline measurement revealed that ""[each participant] respectively completed the treatment phases for all target behaviors after a total of 107, 28, and 22 intervention sessions over a period of approximately 54, 14, and 22 weeks.""ù This was coupled with the results from a post-experiment survey regarding consumer satisfaction that reported a positive reception by each participant.† The discourse that this contributes to regarding the behavioral intervention programs of individuals with ASD reveals that remote instruction can accomplish many of the same effects achieved through ""face-to-face""ù treatment. The implications of this study suggest that it would be beneficial for researchers to consider virtual formats as an accessible option for people needing ASD programs. In a Zoom interview with the Nexus, Ford commented on the lasting impressions of the study moving forward, saying, ""Considering the current pandemic crisis, [our research] reflects how it is important to think about how we can better help adults with autism and look at the things we can do remotely which are consequently more accessible.""ù Comments are closed.

science,Friends of the Island Fox Bolsters Research and Conservation Initiatives With Much-Needed Funds,19-Jul-20,11:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-19/friends-of-the-island-fox-bolsters-research-and-conservation-initiatives-with-much-needed-funds/,"Unquestionably, the story of the island fox (Urocyon littoralis) is one of resounding success in the field of conservation.† Since 2018, FIF has provisioned researchers and ecologists with $5000 in yearly grants. Courtesy of Mike Watling The foxes were almost obliterated by a combination of disease and invasive predators in the late 1990s. Extinction appeared so imminent that entire island populations were scooped up and put into captive breeding programs.† Then, with decisive action taken by conservationists to vaccinate foxes and remove introduced† species on the island, the foxes recovered almost as quickly as they had collapsed. By 2016, several populations under the Endangered Species Act were delisted, the fastest recovery of any mammal ever. However, with delisting comes a new set of challenges for the fox as federal funding has diminished in response, despite the fact that the animals still face a number of threats ""î both new and old.† ""Now that the foxes have been delisted, it's harder for organizations to get money. There's less federal funds available ""¶ it becomes more important for nonprofits to help get money and fill those funding gaps,""ù said Mike Watling, a member of the advisory committee for Friends of the Island Fox (FIF) and a naturalist working in the Channel Islands.†† Established in March 2005, FIF is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting ""efforts to preserve and protect the island fox (Urocyon littoralis) on the California Channel Islands through conservation and education programs.""ù FIF works alongside the patchwork of organizations governing the archipelago, including The Nature Conservancy ""î which owns the majority of Santa Cruz Island ""î the Catalina Island Conservancy and the National Park Service. ""We work directly with their head biologist for the [National Park Service], Laura Shaskey. She's the terrestrial biologist out there. We work with her and talk about what her needs are and then move on to provide funding where we can to meet that need,""ù Watling said.†† According to Watling, FIF also works to procure funding for materials like radio collars to monitor foxes and fox boxes for parkgoers to use, as well as original research to further understand the island fox and contribute to the scientific literature.† Using radio collars to monitor foxes can be useful in many different senses. Attaching collars to young, unvaccinated foxes, known as sentinels, give conservationists a window into the movement of foxes as well as the causes of fox mortality.† ""With these foxes, the radio collar has a mortality sensor and it gives off a specific signal [so] that the biologist can recover the carcass of the fox and determine the cause of death and if action is needed,""ù Watling said. Last year, FIF funded 44 radio collars, their highest number in a single year to date.†† Fox boxes, meanwhile, operate similarly to bear boxes in places like Yosemite and Sequoia National Park, keeping foxes away from food brought in by park visitors. ""It's not so much so the foxes don't go raiding trash cans,""ù Watling said.† ""What happens is the foxes will get into a dumpster. And the foxes are small; they're the size of a house cat. They're really one of the smallest fox species in the world. They're so small that if they fall into the big dumpster-like trash cans, they can't get out and they'll eventually starve.""ù Perhaps of most interest, however, is the original research which FIF has supported. FIF has funded investigations into tick-borne diseases on Santa Catalina Island and serological tests for internal parasites plaguing foxes on San Miguel Island, for instance. Since 2018, FIF has provisioned researchers and ecologists with $5000 in yearly grants, providing grantees with money to funnel into a number of research topics ""î as well as conservation initiatives.† ""We ask, ""òAre we going to get the most out of the money that we're providing to further [""¶]our mission regarding the foxes? What's going to be best for the researchers and their work?'""ù Watling said. In 2019, one such project funded with grant money from the organization was a series of necropsies headed by Stacy Baker and Juliann Schamel. The duo collected and processed fox teeth held in the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.† With this information, they were able to determine the ages of foxes at death by looking at the cementum in teeth, a ""thin mineralized tissue covering the root surface of teeth,""ù according to Watling.† This year, despite the disruption from the novel coronavirus, FIF still plans to issue grants as before, with applications due in late August and grants awarded in late September.† As Watling said, continued interest in further understanding the foxes is the best way to safeguard their survival, as they are animals sequestered on these small islands ""î as well as being genetically very similar. ""We're in the middle of a pandemic here. Can you imagine if we were all genetically the same, and COVID came in? Imagine how quickly that could run through our population. The foxes are facing similar challenges,""ù Watling said. ""It's great to see more people visiting the Channel Islands, but as you have more people visiting, you have more opportunities to introduce threats. There's a lot we still don't know and there's a lot that Masters and Ph.D.s can contribute to that knowledge base regarding continued recovery.""ù ""This is an animal that ""î quite literally ""î has nowhere else to go.""ù Comments are closed.

Courtesy of Michael Drummond In marine fish alone, bioluminescence has evolved independently at least 29 times. Especially in the ocean, it is a subtle yet inescapable trait. There are three main components to bioluminescence. ""There's a substrate, which is luciferin; there's an enzyme, which is luciferase; and then oxygen is combined with those two things to create light,""ù said Jessica Goodheart, a Scripps postdoctoral scholar at UC San Diego.† Goodheart formerly worked with the Oakley Lab at UC Santa Barbara, where she studied ostracods, small bioluminescent crustaceans found all across the world. Specifically, Goodheart worked with her collaborators to study the California sea firefly (Vargula tsujii), an ostracod which uses its bioluminescence for defense.† V. tsujii synthesizes its own luciferins, unlike other bioluminescent organisms like cnidarians and brittle stars that instead make use of lucinferins they obtain through their diet.† An article, published in Scientific Reports, details the team's efforts to establish a laboratory culture of V. tsujii. According to Goodheart, their culture is unique for a number of reasons. ""No other bioluminescent ostracod has been cultured before so that's a completely new thing,""ù Goodheart said. ""There are fireflies that are cultured in the lab and they produce their own luciferin, so this isn't necessarily the first organism that one could culture that produces its own luciferin. However, this has other advantages that other bioluminescent organisms don't have.""ù† In particular, V. tsujii has a short life cycle and is remarkably bright compared to other bioluminescent organisms, making it easier for the researchers to work with.† In order to establish a culture, the researchers first gathered specimens from wild populations, largely from areas near Santa Catalina Island. Specimens gathered for the culture were then placed in tanks. These tanks needed to be modified, however, in order to fit the ostracods' needs. One initial problem came to light when the standard fish filters in the tanks would suck up ostracods into them. In order to rectify this, an undergravel filter was put into place.† ""[Oakley] built an undergravel filter. What that means is that the water filters down into the sand to exit the tank, and we constantly have incoming water flow. This doesn't cause problems for the ostracods because they normally just dig into the sand and stay there during the day,""ù Goodheart said. Another conundrum was deciding what to feed juvenile ostracods. Although adults were easy to feed, as they subsisted on a diet of fish flesh that was available to buy in many places, the juveniles wouldn't bite. ""We needed a food source; that was a pretty foundational thing. Essentially what was happening was, we were getting juveniles, but they wouldn't grow up because they weren't eating,""ù Goodheart said. Eventually, they came up with the idea to use chicken liver to feed the juveniles, drawing inspiration from researchers who've used chicken liver and other liver more generally to attract a species of ostracod called Vargula hilgendorfii, native to Japan.† ""The juveniles loved it. It seemed to be one of the main things that allowed the culture to get started and really ramp up,""ù Goodheart said. With the culture established, the team was able to make a number of observations, starting with mapping out the embryogenesis of V. tsujii. They then mapped the size classes of instar development from one moult to the next, thereby creating a timeline for V. tsujii ""î with the complete life cycle lasting three to four months. One unique aspect of the project was the diversity of institutions involved, with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and UC Santa Cruz collaborating with the Oakley Lab to assist with genomic analyses, as well as California State University, Los Angeles to gather population genetic data and measurement data.† ""We've been able to pull together these [kinds] of disparate pieces into a more cohesive story, which is really nice,""ù Goodheart said.† Meanwhile, at UCSB, a number of undergraduates from the College of Creative Studies, including Geetanjali Minsky, Mira N. Brynjegard-Bialik and Michael S. Drummond, assisted with the laboratory culture itself. ""A lot of the culture work ""î in terms of actual measurements and determining whether we had actually completed the life cycle, as well as looking at the development in terms of both embryo development and juvenile development ""î we had undergrads doing,""ù Goodheart said.† Now, while Goodheart has moved away from ostracods since going to UCSD, the Oakley Lab is still hard at work studying the tiny crustaceans. Recently, they have begun attempts to establish another ostracod laboratory culture, these being related ostracods from the Caribbean that use bioluminescence in courtship displays. ""I think one of the most exciting things about this is that having this culture means that we have a model with which to work to begin bringing other species into the lab,""ù Goodheart said.† ""It opens up a lot of doors for us in terms of working with a bioluminescent system that is used in multiple ways across a number of different species, but also has a very clear and similar biosynthetic mechanism across all of those different species.""ù Comments are closed.

science,"UCSB Researchers Propose a Solution to Address ‚""Bottlenecks‚""ù in COVID-19 Testing",29-Jul-20,6:00 PM,['Joshua Pham'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-29/ucsb-researchers-devise-new-way-to-detect-sars-cov-2-to-circumvent-testing-bottlenecks/,"The recent surge in reported COVID-19 cases in California this past month met with a testing capacity that has now proven its ability to administer over 125,000 tests on a single day.† However, accelerating demand for testing has exerted even more of a strain on the supply chain of testing material to testing networks, which has caused extensive delays across the state.† It took the brainpower of a handful of researchers at UC Santa Barbara to develop a promising solution that could potentially answer some of these issues that exist not only in their state, but across the entire globe.† A representation of the SARS-CoV-2 virion under an electron microscope. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons COVID-19 testing is a multilayered process that depends on the fluency of individual operations and supplies that include, but are not limited to, collecting specimens with swabs, securing viral transport media and executing tests in laboratories with multiple reagents and instruments. Insufficiencies in any of the many necessities employed by the testing system can clog testing schedules and hinder the expansion of testing capacities. RNA extraction kits are just one out of the many necessities that have fallen victim to shortages. Commercial RNA extraction kits approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are used by laboratories to isolate the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 ""î RNA ""î from infected human host cells. This is followed by the next step that is a form of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) known as real-time reverse-transcription PCR, or RT-qPCR, where targeted viral sequences from the isolated RNA are transcribed into DNA copies, and then quantitatively amplified such that it allows scientists to detect these targeted viral sequences that would confirm the presence of the virus. Researchers under the guidance of Diego Acosta-Alvear, Carolina Arias, Max Wilson and Kenneth Kosik ""î professors from UCSB's Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology ""î recognized that a significant factor limiting the COVID-19 testing capacity was the supply shortage of commercial RNA extraction kits.† ""Because RNA extraction is the first step for amplification and detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, these kits can become ""òtesting bottlenecks' when their availability is limited, as has occurred recently,""ù Acosta-Alvear said in an email interview.† Extracting and isolating RNA from SARS-CoV-2 positive host cells are critical steps in the testing process, because if not executed optimally, it could compromise the performance of the subsequent RT-qPCR test used to detect viral infection. Maintaining the sensitivity of this test is pivotal to avoiding false negative results, as asymptomatic carriers who test false negative could unknowingly spread the coronavirus. The steep global demand on kit manufacturers to match increasing testing capacities have motivated researchers to look for alternative methods to RNA extraction and COVID-19 testing.† To offer a solution to the dilemma, the research team developed a method called Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL, or PEARL for short. This method involves subjecting infected host cells to their ""PEARL lysis solution,""ù which can extract nucleic acids and proteins that can then be analyzed for the presence of viral genetic material or proteins.† ""We designed PEARL primarily to eliminate the need for commercial RNA extraction kits which are relatively expensive and are in short supply. PEARL uses common laboratory reagents and is very easy to perform, which alleviates the problem of reagent/supplies accessibility,""ù Acosta-Alvear said. ""We use a nonionic detergent to disrupt cell membranes and viral envelopes, which allows us to retrieve nucleic acids and proteins,""ù he added. ""We also use reagents that inactivate RNA-degrading enzymes and aid in the precipitation of nucleic acids and proteins, including salts and linear polyacrylamide (used as a co-precipitant). Adding isopropanol ""òcompletes' the procedure by allowing the precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins.""ù To validate their approach, they tested for the presence of two specific viral RNA sequences of interest in SARS-CoV-2 positive host cells. Performing side-by-side RNA extractions using both PEARL and a standard commercial RNA kit, they ultimately found that PEARL was as capable as the kit at extracting RNA for subsequent analysis. However, their research did not stop there. PEARL's extended capacity to extract DNA and proteins in addition to RNA opened up doors to broader applications, as these capabilities are not fully available in other commercial extraction kits.† ""When we designed PEARL we wanted to make it versatile. One way to convince ourselves and the public of its usability was to test it using very different viruses.""ù With the right tools, the research team recognized that PEARL could be further tailored to detect viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2. By adding enzymes that degrade one of the main types of nucleic acid ""î either DNA or RNA ""î PEARL can be specified to detect viruses whose genomes are made of one or the other main type of nucleic acid. In an additional experiment, either DNA-degrading enzymes or RNA-degrading enzymes were independently added to different PEARL extracts of host cells that were infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a DNA-based virus, or Zika virus (ZIKV), an RNA-based virus.† As expected, PEARL extracts that were treated with DNA-degrading enzymes allowed detection of RNA but not DNA (such as host cell mRNA transcripts, viral KSHV mRNA transcripts or ZIKV RNA genes), and PEARL extracts that were treated with RNA-degrading enzymes allowed detection of DNA but not RNA (such as host cell and KSHV DNA genes).† ""In this way we confirmed PEARL's ability to retrieve DNA or RNA sequences, which allows detection of different viruses.""ù Furthermore, PEARL's ability to enrich proteins allowed the researchers to successfully detect both host and viral proteins in PEARL extracts of cells infected with these viruses using antibodies.† ""Protein detection can be sensitive and in some ways, ""easier""ù than detection of nucleic acid sequences by amplification, but it relies on antibodies with proven performance,""ù Acosta-Alvear commented. ""If you have a good antibody and you know which viral protein to look for, you got yourself an alternative to detect viruses.""ù Acosta-Alvear concluded, ""These results highlight the broad applicability of PEARL and make us optimistic that PEARL could become a widespread tool for detection of many viruses.""ù In the scope of COVID-19 testing, the ability to retrieve viral proteins, as Acosta-Alvear further noted in the interview, may have useful implications in the avenue of antigen-based testing.† This type of testing focuses on detecting proteins found in SARS-CoV-2 and alongside typical nucleic acid testing, can be used to test for current infection of the coronavirus.† As of now, the Food and Drug Administration has granted Emergency Use Authorizations for two antigen diagnostic tests, both of which detect viral nucleocapsid proteins. These proteins are multifunctional structural proteins that hold the virus's genetic information.† But as to the future of PEARL itself, Acosta-Alvear has weighed up some more exciting possibilities. ""Testing PEARL with other sample types will be important to determine the breadth of its applicability. For example, one could envision using PEARL with urine or blood samples""¶""ù ""PEARL also offers a first step towards field-deployability of pathogen testing as it can be performed in the field, and it can be coupled to our recently developed CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection method we call CREST.""ù ""We are exploring this direction currently and are hopeful we might be able to come up with a fully field-ready test for SARS-CoV-2.""ù And the field will be waiting to shake hands with this promising gem ""î a PEARL, that is.

science,Building Wheat to Take the Heat,14-Aug-20,11:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-14/building-wheat-to-take-the-heat/,"What would life be like without bread? It is such a central part of so many diets that it has become as much of a part of culture as it is a food. It's a symbol of companionship and basic needs. It even serves to represent one's livelihood and ""î by extension, to many ""î self-worth. Breadwinners, anyone? A decreasing trend in precipitation over time has been observed in locations like Su≈üehri, Turkey. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Bread is perhaps most strongly associated with one cereal grain in particular: wheat. If bread is central, wheat is foundational. It is a staple grain in many places across the globe; it is ground into flour or semolina and used to make many different foods from pasta to porridge. It currently provides a large fraction of the daily calories consumed by 4.5 billion people. In the future, demand for wheat is expected to rise 60% by 2050. This is a problem, because as demand is rising, environmental stressors are simultaneously taking a toll on agricultural productivity. Luckily, modern science has taken notice; there is much interest in making wheat resilient to drought and better cope with its varietal stressors, such as heat. Arturo Keller, researcher at UCSB in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management and a coauthor of a pertinent article published in ""Frontiers in Plant Science,""ù collaborated with scientists from the University of Parma and the National Research Council of Italy to better understand how one crop in particular ""î durum wheat ""î may be shaped to better fit our changing climate. Durum wheat is a particular type of wheat which is normally grown in semiarid climates, such as Mediterranean regions, where water is more limited and the ""optimization of the water resources is of major concern,""ù according to Keller. Italy, where Keller's fellow researchers are based, is an example of one such region with this kind of climate. Keller's collaborators worked with particular types of molecules, namely branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases (BCATs), which both have a role in the plant stress response. Keller himself contributed to metabolomics in the paper, a field which he has worked in for five years. Metabolomics refers to the study of metabolites, small molecules which interact with and affect their greater biological system. The metabolites studied were divided up into categories, including amino acids (particularly BCAAs), organic acids and sugars. ""Previous research has shown that BCATs play a key role in the defense mechanisms and the metabolism of BCAAs. Increased levels of BCAAs under drought conditions lead to higher protein degradation""¶† or initiate a defense mechanism which stimulates the catabolic activity of BCAT and prevents the accumulation of toxic metabolites, as shown in sugarcane,""ù Keller described in an email. Which metabolites in particular would be monitored was decided beforehand as the culmination of broader studies looking at hundreds of metabolites to observe and understand their responses to different conditions. Two variants of durum wheat were studied ""î namely, the Colosseo and Cappelli wheat cultivars. Colosseo is more susceptible to drought, while Cappelli is conversely more tolerant of drought conditions. Comparisons of the two showed statistically significant differences in the way that they carry out their drought response. Although no specific mechanisms were identified, the researchers observed that BCAAs were ""positively accumulated during drought stress in durum wheat.""ù To go further, in drawing distinctions between the two cultivars, the researchers found that GABA, one of the metabolites investigated by the researchers, ""was upregulated in the early phases of the drought response in Cappelli but was downregulated in Colosseo, confirming the hypothesis of an involvement of GABA in increasing drought tolerance in Cappelli, acting as ROS scavenger,""ù† Keller said. Alongside this effect, other metabolites, including the amino acids alanine and glycine, choline, glutamate and the organic acids malate and acetate, were observed to increase only in Cappelli, while Colosseo instead responded to drought by increasing its accumulation of sucrose. ""The abundance of organic acids in the drought tolerant Cappelli was increased by [drought stress] supporting its greater capacity in regulating drought stress.† Therefore, there is a molecular basis for the observed resilience to stress.""ù Now, Keller and his collaborators are working on other crop plants such as corn, soybean and tomatoes in order to better understand how they deal with various stressors, especially drought, and how this information can be used to develop treatments. They are making further use of metabolomics profiling to do so. ""Drought, in particular, is a major challenge, thus improving drought tolerance in wheat varieties is of paramount importance for global food security,""ù Keller said. Comments are closed.

science,Researchers Uncover Miniaturized Relative of Dinosaurs and Pterosaurs From Triassic Madagascar,17-Aug-20,8:10 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-17/researchers-uncover-miniaturized-relative-of-dinosaurs-and-pterosaurs-from-triassic-madagascar/,"An ancient Triassic animal from a fossil site in Madagascar has provided researchers and the fossil record with a window into what was likely a ""pronounced miniaturization event""ù that occurred near the common ancestor of the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs. The body sizes of a number of archosaurs plotted on a consensus supertree. Courtesy of Andy Wyss Andy Wyss, a professor in the Department of Earth Science at UC Santa Barbara who worked alongside researchers from Virginia Tech, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the University of Antananarivo for this project, spoke with the Nexus regarding their discovery. Their findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, are significant in their surprising implications regarding the traits held by the common ancestors of the pterosaurs and dinosaurs ""î as well as the remnants of these ancestral features evident in pterosaurs and dinosaurs themselves. Wyss and his collaborators worked in Madagascar for a series of 10 summers, wherein the team's fossil site in southwestern Madagascar bore a number of fruitful fossils numbering in the hundreds. According to Wyss, Madagascar is useful as a paleontological site in particular due to its historical climatic conditions, its historical geographical placement and the presence of a large amount of sedimentary rock on the island. ""The places on the Earth's surface where we have ancient fossils are: number one, where the organisms lived, and number two, also where sedimentary rocks are, which are the kinds of rocks in which fossils are generally found formed and accumulated,""ù Wyss said. ""Madagascar is a giant island; it's actually the fourth-largest island in the world, about the size of California. As recently as Jurassic time it was connected to Africa,""ù Wyss added. As Madagascar began its long journey, drifting away from the mainland, sediments would accumulate on both the island and the mainland, providing a convenient ""geologic trap""ù to preserve the remains of many of the organisms found on the island. ""I work on our terrestrial backboned animals. We want sediments that are deposited in a kind of environment, like ancient rivers, for example,""ù Wyss said. One such animal mixed in among those hundreds of †fossils was an ornithodiran archosaur from about 237 million years ago, dubbed Kongonaphon kely, or ""tiny bug slayer.""ù In order to better understand K. kely's relationship to its other relatives, morphological analysis and dating were performed on fossils of the small animal which the researchers managed to find. Unlike its famously enormous relatives, the dinosaurs, K. kely is remarkably small. ""It was a small-bodied, reptilian-looking animal ""î probably about the size of a pigeon, and it stood on its hind limbs,""ù Wyss said. Although a complete skeleton of K. kely has not been recovered, the bits and pieces of the animal which the researchers have recovered have given them a high degree of confidence regarding K. kely's size ""î as well as a good idea of what the animal was like. The anatomy of the femur and maxilla recovered of Kongonaphon kely. Courtesy of Andy Wyss ""Tooth size is really tightly correlated to overall body size; the teeth of this animal that we've found are extremely small. Partial jaws indicate how small this is,""ù Wyss said. ""Similarly, the length of the femur scales very closely to overall body size. We have a bunch of evidence that points to a small body size.""ù Looking at the microwear K. kely's teeth exhibited informed the researchers of the animal's diet, this being insectivory. The shape of the teeth themselves, being simple and nondescript bulbous cusps, also steered the researchers away from concluding that it had a carnivorous or herbivorous diet. However, perhaps the most informative traits to be gleaned from the fossils were the ones which may have followed K. kely's descendents across species and the evolutionary family tree. According to Wyss, fuzzy skin coverings known as ""fuzzy integument,""ù observed in both pterosaurs and dinosaurs, may have originated from a need for thermoregulation in the small-bodied K. kely. Similarly, Wyss and his collaborators state that, given that miniaturization in other vertebrates is seen as a necessary precursor to the development of flight, perhaps it is the case that pterosaurs might not have become the first vertebrates capable of powered flight if not for the diminutive nature of K. kely. ""A good analog in our own history would be mammals. The earliest mammals were all small-bodied, and being insulated and having hair is quite important evolutionarily ""¶ Now, an elephant today would get by fine without having any hair, and the hair they have is quite sparse,""ù Wyss said. ""But the reason they still have it is because they're descendants of that animal common ancestor, kind of a vestige of that early stage in their evolution. The fact that early [ornithodirans] were small-bodied has repercussions from everything that derived from that common ancestor.""ù Comments are closed.

Anderson, who studies disease ecology and is affiliated with the Tsimane Health and Life History Project, spoke regarding both her current research as well as past experiences performing undergraduate fieldwork in Astypalaia, Greece. Since then, five more episodes of the series have been released. Campbell and her guests have already covered a remarkably diverse array of topics in anthropology and the anthropological sciences, ranging from such seemingly disparate subjects as the role of forensics in bioarchaeology and studies of land use in ecological anthropology. ""That Anthro Podcast""ù creator and host Gabriella Campbell Courtesy of Gabriella Campbell The idea first came to Campbell while she was attending a class with Assistant Professor Danielle Kurin in early May, wherein she and her peers presented research case studies on a variety of topics in anthropology. ""When it was over I was like ""òWhy does this class have to end? I wish we could just talk about all this cool research all summer.' I realized that if I really wanted that I could create it myself,""ù Campbell said. Soon after, Campbell set out to continue the conversation by creating her own anthropology podcast, enlisting the help of Kurin to jump-start the project. ""The goal is to create a larger discussion around various topics, particularly important or hot topics, that new research that's coming up in the field and what it can do for our future in science.""ù Campbell has spoken with UCSB anthropology graduate student MacKenzie Wade, for instance. Wade is an expert in edible insects, studying the sustainability of them. She possesses a particular affinity for the subject ""î enough so that she raised insects and learned how to cook them while living in a Kansas State University dorm room. ""Culturally in the north we have more of an aversion to them. Whereas, you know, in the southern hemisphere, two billion people eat insects, like regularly, as a staple in their diet,""ù Campbell said. ""Here it's a big cultural taboo. I even went out to the store to buy some edible insects so that I could kind of add my own opinions to the podcast.""ù Associate Professor Jeffrey Hoelle is another anthropologist at UCSB who Campbell has spoken to in the podcast. Hoelle is engaged in a decidedly different subject of research than Wade: He studies cattle culture in Acre, Brazil, a region deep in western Amazonia. ""[Hoelle has] done a lot of work in the Amazon with local cattle grazing in the population and how that connects to their use of the Amazon and land use,""ù Campbell said. Beyond his work in the Amazon, Hoelle also involves himself with the local community, managing the Isla Vista Ethnobotany Project as well as Cultivating Socio-ecological Communities, a project aiming to ""facilitate deeper forms of engagement with the environment""ù in I.V. through education into local history, culture and ecology. Then, there are episodes with those like Megan Kenner, a recent biological anthropology graduate of UCSB researching the CPT1A arctic variant, a fatty acid oxidation disorder observed in Native Alaskan populations. The breadth of topics in anthropology covered demonstrate another intention of Campbell's in creating ""That Anthro Podcast:""ù to educate others on what anthropology means to begin with ""îand bring attention to the many subfields which have a home in the remarkably interdisciplinary subject. After all, the subject of human beings is a complicated one. ""Anthropology is very science based, and I think only until you're in the field is when you realize that,""ù Campbell said. ""By exploring all of these different subfields that people might not even know exists within this very wide-ranging subject of anthropology, we can kind of explore all the nuance of it and hopefully share more of it with the public.""ù However, ""That Anth Podcast""ù goes beyond research and results. It also delves into the lives of anthropologists, their unique experiences in the field or in the lab and their individual reasons for doing what they do. ""Something I'm really interested in is what motivates the science,""ù Campbell said. ""What's motivating these researchers, what's inspiring them? What questions are they asking?""ù ""When you look at an author credit on a research article, you see the name but you don't know anything about the author other than that their name is attached to an article. I think going beyond that and finding the people behind the science is really important.""ù Although the podcast was born in the midst of a pandemic, Campbell is planning to make the series a long-term commitment, and is already eyeing post-COVID production. ""I'd love to have two microphones in a room and sit down and have it be in person. I think you can get into a lot deeper, more meaningful conversation because it feels like you're just talking to someone and you forget that you're being recorded,""ù Campbell said. ""This can be a little intimidating over the phone I found. It's a little cold.""ù ""I just want to shine a spotlight on the cool people here and show how much amazing research comes out of the department. We're one of the top departments in the country. No one talks about it, and I think we should be.""ù Comments are closed.

Researchers Observe Mobility Drop Among the Wealthy and Increase Among the Poor During Quarantine",27-Aug-20,5:30 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-27/who-decides-or-is-able-to-stay-home-researchers-observe-mobility-drop-among-the-wealthy-and-increase-among-the-poor-during-quarantine/,"When the novel coronavirus began its rapid spread across the United States in March, several states issued emergency declarations with the aim of restricting movement and preparing states for a surge in hospitalizations.† One's adherence to the guidelines ""îor their lack thereof""î may be due to a number of factors. Kiyomi Morrison / Daily Nexus States also attempted to ramp up social distancing amongst members of the population. With an available vaccine still months away at best, social distancing has become the primary method for reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which propagates most commonly through contact with infectious droplets that can get into the mouth, nose or eyes. These droplets are released from infectious individuals through coughing, sneezing, speaking and singing. However, not everyone has participated in social distancing equally. One researcher at UC Santa Barbara's Department of Economics, Olivier Deschenes, collaborated with researchers and economists from UC Davis and Stanford University to document the relationship between one's income and one's adherence to social distancing guidelines. They published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The foundational research is among the first of its kind to examine the role of income ""as a predictor of social distancing behavior,""ù Deschenes described in an email to the Nexus.† Deschenes primarily works in the area of environmental economics, where he studies how environmental regulations affect health and socioeconomic outcomes using many of the same methodology employed in this research. ""[That] is how I was approached to join the team,""ù Deschenes said, adding that a collaborator on the piece, UC Davis professor Michael Springborn, was formerly a Ph.D. student at UCSB. In order to quantify mobility amongst the population, the researchers made use of four mobility measures taken from mobile phone location pings, drawing from three different sources of data: Google Community Mobility Reports, PlaceIQ and Safegraph. These mobility measures, collected at the census tract level, included three factors. First,† they counted the ""percentage of devices staying completely at home,""ù with ""home""ù defined as the location of the device at night over a baseline period. Secondly, they observed device exposure, a measure of the average number of devices present at all of the locations a device visited in a day. Thirdly, they included the median distance all of the devices in a household traveled outside their homes. And finally, the researchers also looked at the ""percentage change in device presence at locations of retail and recreation relative to the 5-week period from January 3 to February 6, 2020,""ù Deschenes explained. ""One major difference with COVID-19, compared to most other areas of research, is that there was no previous research. Everything we know about the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 (including social distancing) was discovered starting in March 2020,""ù Deschenes said. However, there is still precedent to be found in studies looking at how previous pandemics have restricted mobility. ""There is a smaller literature looking at restrictions to mobility in previous pandemics. For example, [Springborn in a 2015 paper] uses variation in home television viewing behavior as a proxy for changes in the level of daily social interaction in Mexico during the 2009 A/H1N1 [swine] influenza pandemic,""ù Deschenes said. But now, unlike in the circumstances shaping Springborn's research, the almost universal ownership of mobile phones in the U.S. gave the team a treasure trove of ""near real-time data""ù with which to track mobility among wide swathes of the population. In analyzing the data, Deschenes and his collaborators observed a striking phenomenon. Before the pandemic and the ensuing establishment of stay-at-home orders, mobility was highest amongst those in wealthier census tracts and lowest amongst those in poorer tracts. However, once the pandemic hit, the pattern reversed, and the researchers found that the poorest census tracts became the ones with the highest mobility.† The report listed several factors that may have contributed to these results. Drawing from other studies, the researchers noted commonly observed discrepancies between the wealthy and poor's access to information, differences in political preferences which could impact how one processes information and also differences in one's attitude toward risk depending on one's income.† Notably, the authors speculated that less adherence to social distancing guidelines may be a result of the fact that many lower-income earners lack the capacity to work from home, constraining their ability to social distance.† According to the report, the fact that poorer communities also face a higher incidence of preexisting health conditions and have less access to healthcare ""suggests a double burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.""ù† ""One implication is that given the lower ability of low income individuals to social distance (in part due to the nature of the work they do), they should be a priority group once a vaccine is available,""ù Deschenes said. ""Higher-income [earners] individually have more opportunity to work from home and thus social distance, even without a vaccine.""ù As Deschenes and his collaborators continue their research, they intend to add another dimension to their analysis: the spread of the disease and its relationship to the enactment of restrictions.† ""We are also interested in learning if the mobility limitation measures had an impact on COVID-19 case and mortality numbers,""ù Deschenes said.

science,"‚""I really do believe that we owe it to future generations to protect these areas‚""ù: UCSB Lecturer Creates Website to Spread Awareness of Public Lands",30-Aug-20,10:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-30/i-really-do-believe-that-we-owe-it-to-future-generations-to-protect-these-areas-ucsb-lecturer-creates-website-to-spread-awareness-of-public-lands/,"""When I talk to my students about [public lands], I just put my hands [out] in every direction from UCSB. There are extraordinary state, county and national public lands all around us.""ù† Those are the words of UCSB lecturer Deborah Williams who, in collaboration with a number of undergraduate students at UCSB ""î including Phoebe Rogers, Samuel Desre, Jason Mathias, Christian Puga and Whitner Grange ""î created a website, Great Public Land Destinations: Santa Barbara and Beyond, to raise awareness of the diverse natural and historical areas which surround UCSB. Tule elk in Carrizo Plain National Monument, which protects California's largest remaining native grassland. Courtesy of Christian Puga The compendium provides information about 50 public land destinations within a 300-mile radius of Santa Barbara, specifically using Campbell Hall as the epicenter, which Williams chose because of the adjacent bus loop.† Williams was raised in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles and lived in a household with a passion for public lands ""î a passion that Williams inherited. In the early '60s, Williams and her family explored the varietal and bountiful nature of California, from the quietude of places like Carpinteria State Beach to the majesty of the Sierra Nevada. By Williams' own account, her father had one of the first available REI memberships. Prior to working as a UCSB lecturer, Williams lived in Alaska for 37 years, acting as an attorney for the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as serving as the executive director of both the Alaska Consumer Advocacy Program and the Alaska Lung Association. From 1994 to 1999, Williams served as the special assistant to the Secretary of Interior for Alaska, advising the secretary on over 220 million acres of national land. ""The exact title of my class is Public Lands and Waters ""î Law and Policy. When I moved back to California four years ago, I realized that I needed to go [and] either visit or revisit public lands that I had never been to in this area, or hadn't been to in 30 years,""ù Williams said.† ""[While teaching my class], I realized that a lot of my students didn't really know about the public lands around us and didn't understand the scope and diversity of public lands around us. That got me to thinking, ""òWouldn't it be nice to have a website like this for my students, UCSB students and other college students in the Santa Barbara area?'""ù Thus, the seed for the website was planted. In Williams' mind, it would be a tool for discovery and exploration, meant to stoke curiosity and bring to attention the many ways that public lands can serve anyone who visits them. Chumash Painted Cave. Courtesy of Deborah Williams Along with featuring the flora and fauna of California's natural landscape, Williams also wanted to shine a spotlight on public lands which are of particular historical or cultural significance; among these sites, she included Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park, a cave near Santa Barbara harboring centuries-old rock art by the Chumash people. The website highlights a wide swath of public lands, taking users as far north as Yosemite National Park and as far south as Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. From east to west, one can venture off to Joshua Tree National Park and hit the road to Point Lobos State Natural Preserve. The real meat of the website, however, is dedicated to local public lands, the likes of which are most accessible to students at UCSB, including sites like Rattlesnake Canyon, the Baron Ranch trail, many of the parks in Isla Vista and Ellwood Mesa.† The undergraduate students working alongside Williams helped inform her about many local spots, provided input and criticism for the website and also lent Williams photographs of some of the destinations. Of particular note, Grange ""î who is on the board of directors for the Isla Vista Recreation and Park District ""î introduced Williams to the numerous local parks scattered all throughout I.V.† Visitors to the site can narrow down locations by filtering for their intended activity, such as surfing, backpacking or even picnicking, as well as desired distance from Campbell Hall. Bluffs at Ellwood Mesa, a part of the Ellwood Devereux Open Space west of Isla Vista. Courtesy of Deborah Williams Now, with a template in place that is being continuously refined, Williams is hopeful that more people will capitalize on the concept and create a Great Public Land Destinations website for their own locales.† Williams emphasized that she is always reminding her students that they have a voice in how public lands are used, protected and ultimately preserved for those who come after us.† ""I really do believe that we owe it to future generations to protect these areas, and that the best way to protect these areas is to visit them and care about them and take the actions necessary to protect them,""ù Williams said.† Perhaps more difficult than finding places to feature was deciding what not to feature, as Williams said. ""The hard part was narrowing it down to 50,""ù she added. ""Several people have asked me, ""òWhat's my favorite?' And I don't have a favorite. They're like 50 children, all of whom have such special qualities.""ù ""Look at the Chumash Painted Caves, for instance. You're in this gorgeous setting and you can just go out there, let your eyes adjust to the light and transport yourself in time. While there, you can admire the Chumash ancestors and their cosmology, be grateful for their stewardship of this area and appreciate their rich culture.""ù† ""How do you compare that to Yosemite? And how do you prioritize? It's not possible.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 15 of the August 27, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus. Comments are closed.

science,In Photos | Prescribed Burn Conducted on Lagoon Island,4-Sep-20,2:57 PM,"['Daily Nexus Photography', 'Sean Crommelin']",https://dailynexus.com/2020-09-04/in-photos-prescribed-burn-conducted-on-lagoon-island/,"At 11 a.m. on Thursday, Sept. 3, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department conducted a prescribed burn on Lagoon Island. Working alongside the fire department was the UC Santa Barbara Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration.† Lagoon Island, along with Campus Point, is a coastal mesa sandwiched between the Santa Barbara Channel and the UCSB campus lagoon, located just south of the main campus. Dominated by a number of exotic species such as non-native annual grasses and ice plants, both mesas have become sites of extensive restoration efforts and research projects. The .36-acre burn was carried out with the aim of suppressing the growth of non-native grasses ""î such as rip-gut brome grass (Bromus diandrus) ""î to benefit native plants such as bluff scrub, according to a press release by the city of Goleta.† This prescribed burn is one component of an ongoing restoration effort. Controlled burns are tools being used to restore the coastal sage scrub and oak woodland habitats that had existed in abundance across much of what later became the UCSB campus. First employed in 2006, the burns curb the growth of non-native grasses through intense heat, which reduces the ""viability of the non-native seed bank,""ù according to the press release.

science,"Imperiled by the Pandemic, Dorm Life Finds Refuge on Cyberspace With SixFeet",10-Sep-20,6:30 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-09-10/imperiled-by-the-pandemic-dorm-life-finds-refuge-on-cyberspace-with-sixfeet/,"Dorms are a fundamental part of the four-year college experience. Acting almost like a bridge between family living and true independence, dorms give students room and board and a support infrastructure ""î while also allowing them a bit of space to live their life and set their routines.† A video call room in SixFeet. To the right are specific topics which users can subscribe to. Courtesy of Victor Cheng Beyond this, however, dorms offer a social space. Thousands of students are housed in close quarters; inevitably communities arise, people make friends, communicate and seek out those among them with whom they share common interests. Through dorms, new students become further enmeshed in the fabric of university life.† Well, dorms were. On August 28, barely more than a month before the start of the Fall 2020 academic term, UC Santa Barbara announced that ""î except for those with special circumstances ""î undergraduate students would no longer be allowed to live in university-owned student housing for the foreseeable future. Citing the novel coronavirus pandemic and a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Isla Vista, Chancellor Henry T. Yang wrote that the decision was made in an attempt to ""to comply with Santa Barbara County, California Department of Public Health, and University of California guidelines.""ù† However, even though dorms are shuttered, there may be hope for an undergraduate dorm experience in another sense.† Inspired in large part by the pandemic, Victor Cheng, an alumnus of UCSB, and Aspyn Palatnick created SixFeet, a social media platform which aims to provide new and old students with a ""virtual dorm.""ù† ""A lot of people recognize [life in the dorms] as one of the most fun times in college. Since most people aren't able to do that we thought we'd try to extend this experience to everybody [through SixFeet],""ù Cheng said.† Cheng and Palatnick invited me to demo SixFeet for myself, where I had the opportunity to explore the platform alongside the two. In designing SixFeet, Cheng and Palatnick wanted to create an environment where students can connect with those who share similar interests, reach those who take the same classes as them and engage with the undergraduate community in a more organic, spontaneous way. By their own account, the two of them collectively talked to about 200 people in order to craft a platform which would best serve this purpose.† One begins their time on SixFeet by finding and subscribing to subjects which they're interested in. It's a ""topics-based approach""ù which others can access simply by hovering over a user profile.† Users can customize their rooms to adjust occupant capacity and change its name, among other things. Courtesy of Victor Cheng On the main page of SixFeet, one finds themselves in their dorm room: a square which functions as a virtual chat room where one can invite others to hold video calls and communicate. This room is arranged in a block alongside others in similar chat rooms. To the left of these chat rooms is a roster of all of the students currently online in SixFeet.† I entered my dorm room video chat and let Cheng and Palatnick inside my room. They demonstrated a number of functions and walked me through others only I had the power to do. They showed me how to increase the number of occupants in a room, rename a room, bring up random question prompts up during a call and even start games ""î all inside my room. ""The idea is that while you're in the video call, we want to make it as social ""î and easy to be social ""î as possible,""ù Palatnick said. Hovering over the users in a particular room even allows one to see what those people are interested in ""î allowing students to gauge what sort of common interests there may be without even asking to enter.† This has a use in academics as well. ""Say there's like 100 people online and you want to search for other people in CS 140, you could search for CS 140 and find other people [in that particular class],""ù Palatnick said.† Thus, SixFeet is able to connect both those with overlapping interests and an overlapping curriculum. Currently, Cheng and Palatnick are gathering people who sign up for the platform on a waitlist. SixFeet is being offered to students at UCSB, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and University of Pennsylvania, with the platform being launched soon as a weekly service before eventually running 24/7. Cheng and Palatnick envision SixFeet as a platform which is always present and always running ""î but only sometimes the object of a user's complete and undivided attention. ""Say there's only a few people there and you don't have overlapping interests. You could also leave SixFeet as a tab in the background. Then, you'll get notified when others with similar interests hop online,""ù Palatnick said. ""That sort of lets you hang out on SixFeet without having to be completely on it.""ù† While Cheng and Palatnick conceived of SixFeet because of the pandemic, they also see a post-pandemic purpose for the platform as video conferencing becomes more prominent as a form of communication. ""After COVID we feel like the social norms will be different. Let's say you guys meet on a dating site. Before it was kind of weird to do a video call, but now maybe that's something you do; you have a video conference before you meet or when you can't meet in person because it's become so established,""ù Cheng said.† ""We think this is a great use case for facilitating spontaneous conversations,""ù Cheng said. †

science,"Lions and Tigers and Bears, Oh My! How the ‚""Ecology of Fear‚""ù Can Be Instrumental To Achieving Wildlife Conservation Goals",16-Sep-20,10:30 AM,['Joshua Pham'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-09-16/lions-and-tigers-and-bears-oh-my-how-the-ecology-of-fear-can-be-instrumental-to-achieving-wildlife-conservation-goals/,"Traditionally, prey-predator dust-ups have often been thought to be settled once the predator takes the finishing bite or the prey luckily slips away. However, a more overlooked research inquiry growing in wildlife ecology contends that predation does not stop there.† Known as the ""ecology of fear,""ù this research framework explains that the role of fear in a prey animal's† response to risk cues associated with predators may have indirect effects on the behavioral dynamics governing the survival and reproduction of their population. A raccoon (Procyon lotor). Courtesy of Pixabay Fear, as described in this context, refers to the perception and assessment of risk by an animal. It may be followed by adaptive behaviors that prevent or minimize unfavored outcomes. One simple demonstration of this can be found in the coasts of the Gulf Islands, where a 2016 study found that the coastal raccoons spent 66% less time out in open intertidal areas foraging for food when playbacks of dogs barking ""î a large, carnivorous predator ""î were amplified through speakerphones. In this case, the researchers inferred that the perception of risk from the playbacks deterred fearful raccoons from foraging vulnerably on their own prey. As a result of this, a significant increase in the intertidal population of one of the raccoons' tasty meals, namely the red rock crab, was observed. These sorts of behavioral dynamics are of particular interest to Dr. Kaitlyn Gaynor, a postdoctoral researcher in wildlife ecology at the UCSB-affiliated National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. Along with her colleagues, Gaynor discusses in a recent review article the many applications of this ""ecology of fear""ù framework towards greater wildlife conservation strategies and practices, many of which may be related to the national parks we visit or the fresh produce we purchase.† ""Research on the ecology of fear tries to understand the role that risk perception plays in driving not just animal behavior, but broader species interactions,""ù Gaynor said. In other words, the fear that is wired into animals can be adapted into a tool that wildlife ecologists can utilize to indirectly shape animal behavior towards conservation goals, whether it be to increase population densities of endangered prey populations or to protect vulnerable livestock from predation through sensitization to predatory risk cues.† Fear can be both acute and chronic. Acute fear may encompass the ""fight or flight""ù stress response that an animal faces in the immediate presence of a threatening predator. But Gaynor also notes a sort of chronic fear that is backgrounded in the survivalist mind of a prey animal. Chronic fear can function independently of actual predation, and depending on time and location, refers to the underlying level of risk an animal assesses when entering an area they may associate with a higher probability of predation. ""That chronic risk can factor into almost every decision that an animal makes [such as] where to go, how quickly to move, what to eat, or how much time to spend looking for threats.""ù ""Fear therefore, even if a predator is not there, can be very important in shaping an animal's activity, and as a result, this idea behind the ecology of fear is that fear ""î this kind of indivisible force on the landscape ""î can drive animal behavior ""¶ which can affect maybe how stressed an animal is, how likely it is to reproduce, or maybe affect population dynamics.""ù A graphical abstract summarizing how the ecology of fear can be employed in conservation goals. Courtesy of Kaitlyn Gaynor Gaynor devises distinct ""management levers""ù that wildlife managers can pull in order to actively trigger potential fear-based behaviors in animals. These may include manipulating an animal's habitat structure in favor of the prey or the predator, changing sensory risk cues that a prey may learn to associate with predation, conditioning animals to be more or less afraid of certain stimuli or perhaps directly manipulating foraging opportunities for animals in different environments. These ""management levers""ù can be employed in strategies that further respond to prominent wildlife concerns she discusses such as the reintroduction of† na√Øve prey with underdeveloped fear responses to areas of higher predation risk, the management of the cascading effects of certain hunting policies, and of particular pertinence to UCSB students, the mitigation of unfavorable conflicts between wildlife and humans.† ""I think that a lot of us here in Santa Barbara loves to just play outside ""¶ and I think just something to keep in mind is that there are always animals out there ""¶ [that] are afraid and staying away from you.""ù† ""As actors ourselves ""¶ just our presence on the landscape, really, fills the role of this kind of apex predator, where people are constantly instilling fear in animals whether or not we actually pose a true threat. We're noisy, we're ubiquitous, we're large,""ù she added. Consider a local research study that Gaynor cited in her review paper where researchers had reported an increase in the snowy plover population at Sands Beach (adjacent to Coal Oil Point Reserve) when a physical barrier had redirected foot traffic away from the area where they roosted. The study also reported that snowy plovers' population ""distribution contracted to within the protected area.""ù† ""Human-wildlife conflict is a really big issue ""¶ and can be a threat to conservation because sometimes people kill the animals or not support conservation of those animals, and so to keep animals out of crops or to keep them away from livestock, you can kind of instill fear [with] fear-inducing tactics,""ù Gaynor said. ""A scarecrow is kind of the oldest trick in the book.""ù† In another example, a 2018 research study cited by Gaynor found that the installation of fladry, a nylon rope onto which several strands of flags are sewn, correlated with an absence of predation by wolves on livestock housed in several pastures operating in various states of the northeastern United States. The researchers of this study stated that the waving of the flags when suspended in wind acts as a visual deterrent that stimulates fear in the wolves.† On the other hand, Gaynor recognizes that ""animals may [also] be staying really far away from oil wells or hiking trails, even though there isn't actually much of a risk to them there.""ù ""So in that case, maybe you can change an animal's experience; habituate it ""î maybe go out repeatedly and expose the animal to people until it learns that there's not actually a threat there,""ù she adds. In the context of COVID-19, research into human-wildlife conflicts may observe shifts in focus given the absence of humans in certain areas of the world.† ""By being absent from a lot of places where we typically are spending a lot of time outside, we're kind of recalibrating the ecology of fear for a lot of animals.""ù ""Some scientists have called this like the ""òanthropause' ""î like this moment where human activity kind of stopped around the world. And it gives us an interesting look at what the impacts of human activity are on wildlife,""ù Gaynor commented. Dr. Gaynor is currently working on a research project that is trying to assess how the shutdown of national parks back in the spring had affected animal movement.† ""I'm working ""¶ to see, you know, [for] animals that were typically afraid of people and stayed away ""î are they now coming into areas that are now kind of empty because there aren't as many tourists?""ù ""Or in the other case, we have maybe prey animals that were hanging out in campgrounds because they were safer from predators. Are they now kind of leaving and going into other safer areas because people aren't there to keep them safe?""ù† Urban fallow deer roaming a dormant street past nightfall. Courtesy of Jamie Hall. Another question that arises especially in the wake of the global pandemic is the temporal distribution of animal behavior. ""Human activity [has been] creating a more nocturnal world in which animals are kind of seeking out the cover of darkness. And so that's kind of this idea that the ecology of fear can vary over day-night cycles and that people are making a time much scarier for animals.""ù A previous 2018 meta-analysis of 76 studies by Gaynor found an average increase in nocturnality by a factor of 1.36 across the diel patterns of 62 different species of mammals in environments with relatively higher human activity. Shifts towards nocturnality were more pronounced in larger, perhaps easily visible mammals (including apex carnivores), and there were reported responses to all kinds of human presence, both lethal and non-lethal. For an unquarantined world, these findings were evidence for the conclusion that human disturbance during the day drove fear-mediated responses in these animals to shift their activity at night. ""[But now], we're interested to see if animals are becoming less nocturnal ""î are they more active during the day because we're all stuck inside?""ù† ""The pandemic probably helped a lot of species kind of explore new areas that they were typically afraid of because of people, but over the longer term, I think as things are reopening we might actually see an increase in human wildlife conflicts because animals may have gotten used to being in these areas where people were.""ù These ecological nuances that are interwoven with reopening the natural world back to humans are what Gaynor will continue to research globally throughout and beyond the pandemic. But for all of us, perhaps rejoining the natural world will allow us to be more aware of the fact that humans are not the only ones roaming the earth.

Even going into the 1870s, they kept a grasp on an expansive swath of southern Chile. This land was known to them in their native language as Wallmapu.† Mapuche activists parade down a road on horseback. Courtesy of Charles Hale However, from decade to decade, more and more Mapuche land faced encroachment by the Chileans, and their territorial holdings shrank drastically. In the 1970s, the left-wing government of Salvador Allende attempted to rectify these injustices and return the Mapuche's land to them. However, a U.S.-backed military coup brought Augusto Pinochet to power, who backtracked on these policies and instead prompted the rapid consolidation and expansion of exotic forest plantations, hoping to spur a great Chilean economic recovery. Fast forward more than a generation.† Charles Hale, an anthropology professor at UC Santa Barbara, arrived in Patagonia in southern Chile in 2017. He came to land that had historically belonged to the Mapuche people ""î but at the time was being held in a stranglehold by the Chilean forestry industry.† There, Hale and his collaborators, which included the likes of the Mapuche anthropologist Rosamel Millaman as well as the Chilean human rights lawyer Jos√© Aylwin, sought to answer the question of how, perhaps, the Mapuche could reclaim their ancestral land. ""When Pinochet was finally deposed by a democratic process and democracy returned to Chile in 1991, the Mapuche began to mobilize for the recognition of their former territory,""ù Hale said.†† Legal disputes between colonizers and the colonized have been the object of intrigue and intense study among anthropologists for decades. In the early 2000s in Nicaragua, Hale was called as an expert witness for the landmark court case Awas Tingni Community v. Nicaragua ""î which eventually went up to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ""î in which the Awas Tingni used oral history as evidence of their traditional habitation of lands which the Nicaraguan government had earlier conceded to the Korean lumber company SOLCARSA.† ""Often, when Indigenous people have been forced off their land, very rarely do they have titles to the territory that they claim is theirs,""ù Hale said.† One way to give validity to these territorial claims is through the use of oral history to demonstrate traditional occupancy: occupancy from time immemorial.† ""This whole strategy was to convince the court that oral testimony was a means to verify territorial rights,""ù Hale said.† ""The judges ultimately ruled in favor of the community. That became a major precedent for Indigenous territorial struggles throughout Latin America and throughout the world.""ù However, despite this monumental ruling, the Awas Tingni found themselves fraught with challenges afterward ""î ranging from internal divisions to an unwillingness from the Nicaraguan regime to respect the rights that the community had won ""î that prevented them from taking full advantage of their legal victory.† Years later, Hale and his collaborators came to the Mapuche, who found themselves in a similar predicament. However, instead of using the courts, Hales and his collaborators began to look into forestry certifications, namely certifications from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), as a means to pressure companies to acquiesce to the Mapuche's claims of ancestral land ownership. Exotic timberland in Chile. Courtesy of Charles Hale ""Say you buy seafood or coffee, or organic vegetables. There's a certification [to show] that the food was grown or harvested responsibly ""î no chemicals, fair labor, that kind of thing,""ù Hale said.† ""FSC claims that one of the principles that goes into that certification is respect for Indigenous rights. "" Hale and his collaborators theorized that the FSC certification could be used to put consumer pressure on the foresters; they brought this to the attention of Indigenous leaders. The Mapuche, however, didn't bite. They were ""î in fact, are ""î incredibly skeptical of this proposition.† So, for both the Awas Tingni and the Mapuche, what went wrong? Hale believes the two case studies are a lesson in extremes.† In a paper published in American Anthropologist, Hale describes two dichotomous strategies which he has observed, namely ""using and refusing the law,""ù and the difficulties in achieving a balancing act between the two.† There is a struggle, as Hale describes, between ""using""ù the law to advance one's interests and ""refusing""ù the tenets of it which invalidate one's culture.† ""Indigenous struggles have very little confidence in western law, because western law is predicated on the elimination of Indigenous lifeways,""ù Hale said. ""They feel like they have to give up too much in order to get protection that the legal system would provide. So they're constantly in a dilemma where they want to use the law, but they don't want to accept all its parameters, because if they accept the law completely they risk undermining their own struggles.""ù In Nicaragua, for instance, Hale argues that the Awas Tingni were so singularly focused on winning the legal case that they didn't recognize other important aspects of the struggle which were needed to maintain momentum following the ruling.† ""They found that they had abandoned a little too much of the speaking and the organizing and the internal work that was needed to keep them strong,""ù Hale said. In the present day, the Mapuche find themselves on the other end. They're skeptical of the entire system out of a concern that using western-devised pathways to achieve their goal will ""undermine the basis for their refusal,""ù as Hale describes.† ""Justice. Earth. Liberty.""ù Courtesy of Charles Hale ""Refusal is a certain kind of critical stance. It's a stance of defending your own lifeways. It's a stance that you can't submit to the dominant. And it's very powerful. That's often what drives these movements and motivates people to get involved.""ù† Once one works within the legal system, a different logic takes hold. The need for money and lawyers arises. In working in legal and political institutions as they exist now, one is drawn, as Hale describes, ""into a different set of sensibilities and politics.""ù† Hale believes that the most effective movements must be able to do both ""î use and refuse the law ""î and move back and forth between the two approaches to these issues. In fact, this balancing act between strategies goes beyond the conflicts between colonizers and Indigenous people. In the modern world, it even applies to, as Hale describes, ""the current moment.""ù† ""There is what some people are calling a civilizational crisis. We have the convergence of so many really deep structural problems in our society that are global. There's a strong argument that we need to shift in a pretty deep way.""ù ""Now, if you believe that, and as that argument grows as the 21st century advances, then what that brings on is a use and refuse dilemma because we have to be able to think outside the limit of what's currently imaginable in order to try to create something different ""î that's the refuse ""î but we also have to use the tools that we have in order to make that change,""ù Hale said.† ""It's an interesting moment where we may be looking to people who have been marginalized. After seeing people in this category who have been struggling with this idea of ""òuse and refuse' for a long time, now they may just have some of the answers that society needs to draw from.""ù

science,"Over Land and Sea, UCSB Researchers Put a Number on Fast-Growing Microfiber Emissions",28-Sep-20,1:10 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-09-28/over-land-and-sea-ucsb-researchers-put-a-number-on-fast-growing-microfiber-emissions/,"Plastic pollution has become inescapable. Decades of waste have accumulated in the land and the sea. We find plastic in animals. We find plastic in plants. And, as horrific though unsurprising as it is, we find plastic in our own tissues.† Even in some of the most remote places on Earth, plastic has been reported raining down from the sky.† Microfibers are microplastics shed from synthetic clothing, such as polyester, nylon and acrylic.† Courtesy of Pixabay Jenna Gavigan, a researcher at UCSB, in collaboration with Timnit Kefela, Ilan MacAdam-Somer, Sangwon Suh and Roland Geyer† ""î all from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management ""î have been hard at working hoping to understand the magnitude of plastic in the environment which can be traced back to one source in particular: the clothes on our backs.† Their research, published in PLOS One, aims to provide an estimate of the total microfibers released into the environment, whether this be into water bodies, terrestrial environments, landfills or through incineration from 1950 to 2016. Microfibers are microplastics shed from synthetic clothing, such as polyester, nylon and acrylic. From the moment synthetic clothing is manufactured to the time it is tossed and beyond, tiny lint-like strands of plastic come off the clothing and into the environment nearly constantly. From day to day, this shedding is virtually imperceptible, but it is happening.† Washing synthetic clothing in particular leads to considerable shedding of microfibers. Although they have only been the objects of study for a short time, the amount of microfibers currently being released into the natural environment has drawn alarm from scientists, environmentalists and policymakers across the world. ""[This increase in emissions] is partly because synthetic fibers are cheaper to produce. There are now more synthetic fibers being consumed than natural fibers. And then the overall apparel demand is also increasing,""ù Gavigan said.† Studies have linked the presence of microfibers to increased mortality in plankton and significant impacts on the physical and chemical properties of soil. Microfibers can also absorb toxic chemicals. When different species mistakenly consume the plastics, they end up ingesting concentrated toxic substances alongside the microfibers.† So how did the researchers obtain their estimate?† First, a method to trace microfibers to their final destinations needed to be devised. This proved a complicated undertaking, necessitating the combination of several different models into one.† The team first obtained synthetic fiber production data. Then, with a discretized log curve, the lifespan of a piece of synthetic clothing was estimated. By subtracting the clothing discarded in a year from the clothing produced ""î while adding the clothing carried over from a previous year ""î a use stock of clothing was created.† Then, a washing model was added to estimate the amount of microfibers shed from clothing in a wash, which was coupled with an estimate of the numbers of washes per household in a year. ""Once we did that, we [used] wastewater treatment data to calculate the amount of wastewater that's treated and not treated. Any untreated wastewater just [immediately] goes into water bodies,""ù Gavigan said.† For treated wastewater, the researchers learned that the vast majority of microfibers, 98 to 99%, is retained from wastewater and held in biosolids, or treated sewage sludge. ""So then we had to get biosolids management data, which determines if those microbes in those biosolids are applied to land, waterbodies. landfills or incineration,""ù Gavigan said. The study found that from 1950 to 2016, 5.6 megatons of microfibers were released into the environment. Half of this happened during the last decade, due to exponential increases in synthetic microfiber consumption. ""I think that the magnitude of the issue is kind of shocking,""ù Gavigan said. ""There's [around] 2.9 million tons of synthetic microfibers that have been admitted to water bodies. I converted that into the amount of jackets, the equivalent mass of fleece jackets, and it came out to be over seven billion fleece jackets. That was a very shocking number for me.""ù† The proportion of microfibers emitted to land rather than bodies of water also drew attention from the researchers. Although water bodies are most often the subjects of studies looking into the effect microfibers have on the environment, Gavigan observed that the gap between terrestrial and water body emissions has been quickly closing, in part due to improvements in wastewater treatment which redirect microfibers to land. In order to be better prepared for the impacts of microfibers on terrestrial bodies, the researchers believe that more research into their expected effects is urgently needed.† ""The majority of biosolids are applied to land, specifically cropland. We predict that once wastewater treatment access improves around the globe, we'll just be seeing more and more emissions to land rather than water bodies,""ù Gavigan said.† ""What are the interactions of microfibers on cropland, for example? We just don't know.""ù† Comments are closed.

science,UCSB Anthropologists Identify Common Misconceptions About Child Marriage Among Americans,4-Oct-20,3:00 PM,['Leon Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-04/ucsb-anthropologists-identify-common-misconceptions-about-child-marriage-among-americans/,"Efforts to abolish child marriage around the world are obstructed by common public misconceptions with regards to the subject. To quantify these misconceptions, a team of anthropologists at UCSB ""î including David W. Lawson, Rachel Lynes, Addison Morris, and Susan B. Schaffnit ""î launched a survey to gauge public knowledge of child marriage. Faiz Mohammed, 40, and Ghulam Haider, 11, who were betrothed to one another, in 2012. UN photo by Stephanie Sinclair/Tooyoungtowed.org Their findings, published in PLOS One, also delve into the considerations which global health and women's organizations must take into account because of these misconceptions. Child marriage is defined by the UN as the wedding of two individuals where one or both participants are below the age of 18. This practice is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where a respective 38% and 30% of girls are married before they reach 18 years of age. Despite the clear-cut definitions, the matter is poorly understood by the general public because of incorrectly perpetuated stereotypes and assumptions. In a Twitter thread published by Lawson, he wrote, ""We predicted public misconceptions would be common because the term ""òCHILD marriage' conjures the notion of prepubescent brides & because awareness campaigns routinely utilize shocking images/extreme scenarios to capture public attention.""ù† Sure enough, images that pop up under the search query ""child marriage""ù usually depicts something along the lines of a forced marriage between a preteen girl and a middle aged man.† This survey distributed by Lawson's team consisted of 10 questions and was given to 755 people, who relied solely on their preexisting knowledge on the subject. Of the individuals who took the survey, 59% were women, 55% were college educated and 95% were born in the United States.† All participants were asked to assign themselves a number as a self-evaluation of their political views. For the range of 0 for completely liberal to 100 for completely conservative, the median of the sample was determined to be 47. The questionnaire was designed to ascertain the participants' understanding of the legality of child marriage. 49% of the participants correctly answered 18 years as the UN threshold for determining a child marriage. Approximately a third of the participants believed 16 years to be the threshold.†† Participants were also asked the common age range and regions of the world of child marriages. 74% incorrectly assumed that the practice was most common among minors below the age of 16, despite it being most frequent just below the age of 18. 51% of participants wrongly stated that child marriage is most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa, with only 15% correctly recognizing that most child marriages take place in sub-Saharan Africa.† Courtesy of David Lawson Though the misinformation distributed by the media is useful in garnering support for abolishing child marriage, it comes at the cost of raising harmful cultural stereotypes for the nations that exercise the practice, the researchers argue. Since child marriage is widely assumed to occur without the consent of the underage female, overestimating the prevalence of the practice may cause high-income countries to antagonize the cultural traditions of South Asian and African nations. Additionally, since underage women are often perceived as passive victims of child marriage, parents and husbands are frequently described as exploitative and coercive. This inaccurately reinforces the notion that low-income nations must be morally ""rescued""ù from their own cultural practices. According to Lawson and his collaborators, these representations can undermine humanitarian efforts to alleviate the issue as well as encourage ethnocentric judgements of poorer nations. The survey indicated that the overwhelming majority of participants believed that child marriage is illegal throughout the United States, suggesting widespread ignorance about the fact that marriage below the age of 18 was only illegal in two states at the time of the survey.† This raises issues according to the researchers, as it reflects the hypocrisy in the American view on the subject; many high-income countries such as the United States routinely place pressure on nations that exercise child marriage to enforce stricter laws on the matter, despite the unsuccessful implementation of similar laws within the United States.† Another implication of these results is that organizations that seek to abolish child marriage in the United States, such as Unchained At Last, should act on the assumption that the vast majority of the public are oblivious to the fact that it remains legal in most states, the paper describes. Child marriage is considered to be a ""harmful cultural practice""ù since underage girls are legally unable to give consent. This presents an ethical obligation for intervention, which has allowed for policy attention on the issue to escalate in recent years. For example, a global partnership of over 1,000 civil society organizations called Girls Not Brides tasked itself with ending global child marriage via raising public awareness for the practice and its consequences.

science,"Science and Ethics in History, the Ivory Tower and Beyond",11-Oct-20,11:00 PM,['Serhat Suzer'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-11/science-and-ethics-in-history-the-ivory-tower-and-beyond/,"How trusted are scientists? A poll from the Pew Research Center has public confidence in scientists to be among the highest of all professions in the United States, with 35% of those polled responding they had a great deal of confidence and another 51% reporting a fair amount of confidence in scientists. Public confidence in science is important to advance groundbreaking research and protect public health, but in order to preserve this confidence, we must recognize its shortcomings and strive to prevent them in the future. The scientific community has committed atrocities and while regulations have been implemented to prevent these, we must also educate the next generation of scientists about the consequences their actions could have. We do not have to go far back into history to see how poor ethical standards in a scientific discipline caused human suffering. Eugenics, ""the practice or advocacy of improving the human species by selectively mating people with specific desirable hereditary traits ""¶ by ""òbreeding out' disease, disabilities and so-called undesirable characteristics from the human population,""ù is one prominent example. Despite its flawed assumptions about genetics, the eugenics movement gained traction in the racially charged U.S. of the 1900s, amassing support from prominent Americans such as President Theodore Roosevelt, who wrote in 1914, ""I wish very much that the wrong people could be prevented entirely from breeding.""ù A poster from the 1930s advertising the British Eugenics Society. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Despite this support, forced sterilization rates did not see widespread use until after the 1927 Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell, which upheld the practice. Terry Gross on NPR reports that this paved the way for the forced sterilization of as many as 70,000 Americans, an action that was supported by the top scientists of the time. Among them was Harvard President Emeritus Charles William Eliot, who believed that preserving the Anglo-Saxon gene pool of the U.S. was of the utmost importance. The use of science to give credence to the idea of racial purity was taken further in the meeting halls of Nazi Germany and the laboratories of the Imperial Japanese Army. Instead of being condemned, many of these scientists later found refuge in the U.S. through government operations like Operation Paperclip, as the U.S. took ""roughly 1,600 of these German scientists (along with their families) ""¶ to the United States to work on America's behalf.""ù In addition to providing refuge to these scientists, the government also expunged ""incriminating evidence of possible war crimes from the scientists' records.""ù These actions from the U.S.† government allowed war criminals to evade prosecution. Following the end of the Second World War, several experiments were conducted on unsuspecting Americans by the U.S. government such as MK-Ultra, ""a top-secret CIA project in which the agency conducted hundreds of clandestine experiments""îsometimes on unwitting U.S. citizens""îto assess the potential use of LSD and other drugs for mind control, information gathering and psychological torture.""ù Another atrocity committed by American scientists was the Tuskegee Syphilis Study where 399 Black men in the late stages of syphilis were experimented on by the U.S. Public Health Service. †""The data for the experiment was to be collected from autopsies of the men, and they were thus deliberately left to degenerate under the ravages of tertiary syphilis ""¶ ""òAs I see it,' one of the doctors explained, ""òwe have no further interest in these patients until they die,'""ù according to an article published by Allan Brandt in The Hastings Report. A photograph of participants in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Courtesy National Archives Since then, various regulations have been put in place to make sure these inhumane experiments can never take place again. Two important factors among many in maintaining ethical standards within science are the widespread implementation of ethics committees in hospitals, research institutions and various other organizations, and the importance of ""òinformed consent' before conducting any human experiments. However, disparities in health, especially for people of color, still persist. This gap in healthcare outcomes is a complex and increasingly pressing problem in modern society. Two researchers, Bryan Schonfeld and Sam Winter-Levy state in their article ""How to Study Racial Disparities,""ù published in Scientific American, that ""nationwide, Black people have been 3.7 times as likely as white people to die of COVID-19.""ù A factor in this disparity is another inequality: the lack of racial diversity in researchers. In a study by Di Fang, Ernest Moy, Lois Colburn, and Jeanne Hurley, compiled data surrounding medical researchers found that among 50,145 full-time U.S. medical school faculty ""data indicate[s] that minority faculty are promoted at lower rates compared with white faculty.""ù This is deeply troubling as Paul H. Barber and other researches write: ""Diversity results in better, more impactful, and more innovative science ""¶ [and addresses] challenges faced by marginalized and nonmarginalized communities.""ù The lack of medical researchers in communities of color has created a disparity in quality of care and opportunity. This divide needs to be addressed. There is a lot of work to be done and while the correct steps are being taken, it is up to the next generation of scientists to hold the system accountable. It is important to take this conversation back to where we live and study.

We can use a similar method, by examining the actions of UC Santa Barbara to gain a better understanding of the scientific discipline as a whole. Courtesy of Doug Thrower This leads us to our question: Has UCSB enacted changes that not only rectify the wrongs of the past but educate the next generation of decision makers to not make new mistakes? To gain insight into UCSB, the Nexus interviewed Doug Thrower, a senior lecturer in the UCSB Department of Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB). Thrower has implemented changes into his curriculum to educate his students about the various injustices committed by medical scientists and biologists. Disclaimer: These are Doug Thrower's opinions. They are not reflective of UCSB, the Daily Nexus or the MCDB Department. Daily Nexus: What safeguards are put in place to prevent the university from engaging in unethical research practices? Thrower: At UCSB we have this concept of dual governance where you have administrators who oversee the university but also defer to a governing unit of academics ""¶ This is not to say lapses don't occur, but there have been much less frequent incidents. Another important aspect is the role of the press and whistle-blowers. I receive an email from UCSB every year ensuring my rights as a whistle-blower and my responsibility to report unethical actions. But most importantly society as a whole has moved forward from the narrow ethics of the 19th and 20th centuries. Daily Nexus: What decisions have been made to acknowledge past ethical lapses and to cultivate greater diversity within the faculty? Thrower: Many of my colleagues will incorporate these ethical lapses in many of our fields into their curriculum, and while the lack of diversity in our fields may not be intentional racism it is ""î in effect ""î racism. We need to address this by changing hiring practices and supporting our students through their academic journey[s]. I believe we will see real change but it will take time and new hires in some cases. Daily Nexus:† Has UCSB done the necessary work in educating its students to not only not repeat the ethical mistakes of the past but to rectify the ones being done right now? Thrower: As with most things this is a work in progress. I know for sure we have recently made a lot of changes that should have been made sooner. It shouldn't take the deaths of people to cause this change. The sad thing is people die before others think about change. It is important to keep the movement going, we have seen too often where a movement gets started and then people lose interest. The hardest thing is to sustain changes over the long haul. It is important to have a push to prevent things from gradually reverting to the way things were before. It is important for the next generation to hold us, the previous generation, accountable.

Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The mosquito was first spotted at a home in Santa Barbara near the intersection of North La Cumbre Road and Foothill Road, and was later identified as Aedes aegypti. According to Brian Cabrera, general manager of the Mosquito and Vector Management District, this species, originating from Africa, has the potential to transmit several viruses, including dengue, yellow fever and Zika.† ""It's a very serious concern,""ù Cabrera said. ""In Southern Florida, where this mosquito also is, they're experiencing localized transmission of dengue fever. This is one of the reasons why we're so concerned about these mosquitoes ""¶ we have mosquitoes that are capable of transmitting such diseases.""ù While these diseases are not locally transmitted in California, Cabrera said the Mosquito and Vector Management District is taking the threat posed by these mosquitoes very seriously.† According to Cabrera, the mosquitoes, as they spread, pose a detriment to the quality of life for Santa Barbara County residents. ""In areas in Southern California where they've been around for a while now, people call them ankle biters,""ù Cabrera said. ""Plus, they're very highly adapted to living around and in human dwellings. They don't travel very far away because they know there are humans nearby to feed on.""ù However, removal of this particular species will prove difficult, Cabrera said.† ""We'll do what we can to try to eradicate it,""ù Cabrera said. ""We want to try to stay positive, but more than try to eradicate it, we're trying to just control the population. It's going to be a very long uphill battle, because in these areas where it is now [in Santa Barbara County], there is so much vegetation where water can accumulate and the mosquitoes can lay their eggs.""ù According to Cabrera, these mosquitoes will be very difficult to wipe out because of how little water the larvae require to hatch ""î about a bottle cap's worth. This means that the eggs can be laid and hatch indoors in practically anything: buckets, birdbaths, plates under potted plants and in the plants themselves.† ""It doesn't take much, and their eggs can survive without water for several months,""ù Cabrera said. ""It's also a very tough mosquito to try to keep under control because they can breed very quickly. The development time from an egg to an adult can be as short as a week to 10 days.""ù According to Cabrera, spreading awareness is one of the most important parts of controlling this invasive species. Residents of Santa Barbara County are being urged to remove all sources of standing water. Larvae can cling to the sides of containers as well, so it is important to scrub any left out containers clean to dislodge the eggs. The Mosquito and Vector Management District also recommends that residents wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, use insect repellent and keep their doors and windows closed or otherwise screened.† In addition to spreading awareness and urging individual efforts to help quell the spread of this species, the Mosquito and Vector Management District† staff are setting up traps and conducting property inspections where the mosquitoes were originally found.

science,Rivers in Madagascar Offer a Window Into the Inner Workings of Abrupt Channel Shifts,18-Oct-20,10:30 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-18/rivers-in-madagascar-offer-a-window-into-the-inner-workings-of-abrupt-channel-shifts/,"Sam Brooke, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara, has been curating Landsat satellite imagery, looking at the major rivers of the world in search of patterns on the decadal scale. He has an eye out for one feature in particular: how the river channels approaching the sea have changed over time ""î in other words, avulsions.† Swollen, sediment-filled rivers draining into Mahajambe Bay in northwestern Madagascar. Courtesy of U.S. Geological Survey A river avulsion is an event in which a river shifts its course, abandoning a channel in favor of a new one. Such events can be devastating to the communities around these areas.† ""Avulsions are potentially one of the most unpredictable but also dangerous river natural hazards because most of the world's population likes to live on fertile plains where you can grow things, and [river] deltas make fantastic farmland,""ù Brooke said.† Rivers are constantly adjusting their channel paths in response to water discharge and the supply of sediment along and, occasionally, against them. Sometimes, however, one will encounter a major shift where a river has moved multiple channel lengths. Deltas and alluvial fans have a fan-radial shape to them because of these shifts over time, according to Brooke.†† ""Our end goal ""¶† is to collate global avulsions and figure out where they are and whether our models can adequately predict why they occur where they occur,""ù Brooke said. ""We have a hypothesis that avulsions tend to occur in areas where there is both sufficient sediment supply and sufficient flood discharge variability.""ù† Brooke and his collaborators, including Vamsi Ganti, an affiliated professor in the Department of Earth Science, are among the first group attempting to map out where avulsions occur and using this to test existing hypotheses regarding the factors and conditions leading to these events. The conventional belief is that the node of an avulsion ""î the point of a river where it begins to branch off ""î tends to occur within the backwater reach of a river, which is the length upstream from the mouth of a river where the effects of the sea, or a standing body of water like a lake, are felt. In a backwater, there is often little or no current.† The backwater reach is often the site of avulsions because the deceleration of water which occurs there tends to result in an aggregation of sediment on the bend of the river. Over time, rivers there begin to degrade and eventually an overbank occurs, in which a high flood event causes a river to carve a new channel in search of a better path of least resistance. However, in Madagascar, the researchers discovered avulsion nodes much further away than scaling using the backwater length would have predicted ""î about 20 times further. Sites in Madagascar may appear initially to be an edge case.† They believe other factors, such as flood events and the characteristics of sediment in a river, are in play influencing avulsion nodes in Madagascar, which could help bolster their hypothesis. ""This was a good indication to us that areas with sufficient fine-grained deposits that are also steep are highly likely to be very prone to adjusting quickly to changes in discharge variability,""ù Brooke said. ""That's the kind of model that we want to test.""ù† According to Brooke, there are two parameters: flood discharge variability and the time that it takes a river to adjust. These ""compete""ù with one another. If the length of a flood event exceeds the amount of time it takes a river to adjust, then erosion during the flood can occur further inland from the backwater reach, affecting the location of the avulsion node.† Rivers in Madagascar are particularly steep and contain very fine saprolitic soils made of silt. Madagascar, in fact, is one of the fastest eroding basins on Earth, owing to both its saprolitic soils as well as extensive deforestation. During flood events, the rivers become turgid with this silt. ""And so in Madagascar, we have a combination of both very high flood discharge variability and very fast river adjustment timescales,""ù Brooke said.† ""From the months of January to March, the rivers will be at their maximum depth; there will be at their bankfull width and depth. This time, all the material in the backwater reaches at the very bottom of the river, where it's closest to the sea, will be raised. And the floods coming from the upstream will scour way further up, past the backwater length.""ù† If Brooke and Ganti prove correct, this does not bode well for rivers facing shifts in weather and flood discharge due to climate change and sea level rise.† ""This Landsat-based remote sensing fieldwork that we've done in Madagascar is the first test of the importance of the intensity and length of your floods on setting the location of avulsions, and Madagascar has been a fantastic example of where these effects can really produce a tangible difference in how our rivers change over time,""ù Brooke said. ""The climate change component of this is the importance of flood discharge variability and how that might relate to changing rainfall.""ù† If rainfall becomes more extreme, as climate science suggests, the flood scour durations will increase in response to this. According to Brooke, this will cause avulsion nodes to migrate upstream, putting more people and land at risk of avulsions. On top of this, sea level rise may result in upstream migration, as well as an increase in the length of the backwater. Having completed this promising first step, the researchers now plan to look to other avulsions and to mount more evidence.† ""What we're going to do now is with our new database of about 100 avulsions ""î in Java, the Philippines and all over the world ""î we're going to ask, ""òDoes our model hold up?'""ù Brooke said. ""We might be close to a model that works everywhere ""¶ In our current model, Madagascar isn't an edge case. It's just an area where avulsions are much better described through flood scour.""ù

During the first part of infancy, parvovirus continues to pose a mortal threat to unvaccinated puppies. Wild animals as well must navigate a gauntlet of infectious diseases.

But most cases you go in and a parasite might be endemic in the population,""ù said Mark Wilber, a researcher working in the Briggs Lab at UC Santa Barbara.† ""You see a dead host [but] you don't know if [that was caused by] a parasite or something else.""ù† Wilber, working alongside Cheryl Briggs, a professor in the ecology, evolution, and marine biology department at UCSB, and Pieter Johnson, a professor from the University of Colorado Boulder, has been trying to find a way around this conundrum.† Their research, published in the Journal of Animal Ecology, combines mathematical modeling, laboratory experiments and field studies in order to quantify the impacts on mortality that endemic diseases ""î defined as diseases that are always present in a host population ""î may have. The researchers had earlier developed a flexible statistical model, specifically looking at patterns of aggregation in parasite abundance. These patterns informed host mortality.†† ""When we previously published this approach, it was theoretical. It was, ""òHere's how we could do it,'""ù Wilber said, referencing a 2016 study that was also conducted with Briggs ""Here, we actually wanted to test it empirically,""ù† A solid candidate for the researchers to test this with was Ribeiroia ondatrae, a trematode parasite that infects many different species of amphibians all across the Western United States. While it is well known for causing limb malformations in adults, the researchers instead focused on R. ondatrae's effects on the larval stage in populations of the Pacific chorus frog, California newt, western toad and rough-skinned newt.† Wilber and Briggs corroborated their model with data gathered from Johnson's laboratory and fieldwork. A total of 202 ponds, located in Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties in California, provided field data informing the researchers of host-parasite distributions. People in the field sampled these twice ""î once in late spring to quantify larvae density and once in late summer to measure [R. Ondatrae] abundance in hosts that had recently metamorphosed. ""[R. ondatrae] systems are really nice because they meet a lot of the assumptions that are necessary to apply this approach,""ù Wilber said.† ""If you think about larvae and [R. ondatrae], [R. ondatrae] infects these larvae when they're in these ponds during the larval period, and when [Johnson] and his crew sample these amphibians, they sample them right after metamorphosis. [R. ondatrae] no longer infects hosts who leave the water because [R. ondatrae] is cruising around in the water.† ""So there's sort of a separation of infection. And sampling is really key for this method to be applied. This was a really neat system where we can accurately have that assumption that we can test for population-level effects.""ù Meanwhile, controlled laboratory experiments were carried out in order to examine the effects that different amounts of R. ondatrae in a host had on the larvae. The researchers wanted to understand how quickly amphibians would die with different levels of exposure. In other words, a dose-response experiment.† The researchers found that amongst the studied populations, R. ondatrae infection was associated with an average population-level mortality of 13 to 40%.† However, within this mortality likely exists a great deal of variability. According to the researchers' modeling, infection in some populations contributed to more than 90% of the mortality and disproportionately contributed to total mortality, while other populations were left largely unscathed. Zooming out and looking at the landscape, the modeling predicted that fewer than 20% of the sites were epicenters of mortality, where over 80% of the deaths on the landscape occurred.† ""We're able to test the models that we've fit using the lab or field data. We test how well those models are able to predict the data that we use to fit them,""ù Wilber said.† ""That's kind of a coarse way of doing goodness of fit. It gives us a sanity check. If our models are not doing a good job predicting the data that were used to fit them, then we know our models are not very good. In this case, our model delivers a really good job.""ù† However, despite this, the researchers have not yet been able to test whether predictions of percent mortality were actually happening in the field.† ""Some of the things we've been brainstorming now [are ways] for future studies to validate these predictions,""ù Wilber said.† ""One thing that we cannot do with the study""¶ We can't say necessarily what effects these estimated levels of mortality have on the population""¶† Frogs and toads typically produce a lot of eggs and a lot of tadpoles, and a lot of those tadpoles die regardless due to a variety of things.""ù† ""We're seeing parasites cause a lot of mortality in larval amphibians but those might have died from something else had they not been killed by the parasite. So they might have a very limited effect on the population as a whole.""ù

It's hard to stay awake. You turn on the radio and tune into your favorite station: 103.3 FM. ""Changes""ù by David Bowie is playing. You stick to the same station, you hear another song: ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart,""ù a duet with Elton John and Kiki Dee. Classic.† Then you want something a little different. You switch to 93.7 FM. Pachelbel's ""Canon""ù is playing. A massive shift from 103.3 FM, but you like it. You stick with this station and you keep on cruisin'. But wait, is it actually a massive shift?† Bourne and her collaborators have attempted to map characteristics in music to entity and relational categories. Courtesy of Tibor Janosi Mozes / Pixabay What makes music similar? What makes ""Canon""ù so different from ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart?""ù In what ways do ""Canon""ù and ""Changes""ù share an unexpected resemblance?†† What is the psychological basis for the categories people conceive of while listening to music? These are questions that researchers in the UC Santa Barbara Music Cognition Lab have been trying to answer experimentally.  Janet Bourne, an assistant professor in UCSB's Music Department, held a seminar on Oct. 23 where she discussed the lab's recent work.† ""Music theorists assume that listeners categorize musical themes using what they call structural features. Music theorists say that listeners categorize music based on pitch, based on the melody notes, based on rhythm or based on harmony ""î all of these parameters and features that music theorists think are very important and prioritize,""ù Bourne said.† ""However, previous empirical work in both similarity and categorization find that listeners use, predominantly, what's been called surface-level features.""ù† Surface-level features include dynamics, how loud or how soft a piece is played; texture, the style of a piece or how it's embellished; articulation, how individual notes are sounded; and timbre, what musical instruments are used ""î among other things.†† Bourne illustrated this with two tracks. Both were renditions of Richard Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries,""ù however, one was the original and the other carried stylings of tango music.† In cognitive science, distinctions exist in the ways that people categorize what they encounter in daily life. Bourne and her collaborators have attempted to map characteristics in music to two types of categories: entity and relational. Courtesy of Janet Bourne Entity categories are categories in which members share ""intrinsic features and feature correlations,""ù according to Bourne. To illustrate this, Bourne described the unifying features of cows. Cows have udders, two horns, white, brown or black fur and a tail. People grouping cows together base what is considered a cow on these traits.†† In contrast, relational categories are categories in which members are related through their relationship to things, rather than properties they literally have in common. Relational categories find similarity through analogy.† ""We have classic examples of barriers, a wall, a gate, a barrier reef ""¶ [But] cookies can be a barrier, if you're on a diet. Exhaustion can be a barrier, if you're trying to study,""ù Bourne said.† ""It [seems] from experiments that have been run that people tend to be drawn to categorizing based on entity categorizing, and it's a lot more difficult to persuade people to perceive and categorize things according to relational categories.""ù† However, there are relational category experiments which have shown that people have a propensity to group visual stimuli using relational categories if they have been exposed to multiple ""exemplars""ù of that category alongside one another. This spurred a question for the researchers.† ""What my lab and I asked was: ""òHow would listeners categorize music if we used tasks from relational category experiments?'""ù† Bourne and her collaborators mapped elements in music to either entity or relational categories. Register, dynamics, articulation, texture and timbre were classified as entity category features, while pitch, rhythm, meter, harmony and contour were categorized as relational category features.† In the control, there were only three excerpts. Participants listened to one excerpt and had to choose between two different excerpts ""î one being a relational match and the other an entity match ""î regarding which was most similar to the target excerpt.† However, in the experimental group, a fourth excerpt was added. This was a relational match meant to establish a basis of comparison. The participants listened to the two excerpts and then were asked to rate their degree of similarity. Following this, the participants were asked the same question as those in the control.† These were conducted three times, focusing on a popular music harmonic schemata, an 18th century thematic schemata and an 18th century contrapuntal schemata. The results showed that participants chose relational matches significantly more often after making comparisons, and that comparison, regardless of musical training, influenced the parameters which participants of the studies considered in grouping excerpts.† Following this, Bourne and her collaborators carried out another experiment.† ""What our experiment two was trying to tackle ""¶ [was] whether it is comparing the exemplars or just hearing multiple exemplars that sways participants to categorize using relational metrics.""ù† However, the results from this have been mixed. Bourne and her collaborators' hypothesis did not bear fruit.† ""It's possible that this is a flawed adaptation of [relational category experiments] for auditory stimuli,""ù Bourne said. ""There is a huge difference in visual stimuli versus auditory stimuli.""ù† Now, looking forward, the researchers are contemplating how to address potential issues with their experiment ""î possibly by changing the tempo of excerpts or making more controlled stimuli, isolating certain musical parameters.†† In the meantime, while this is getting sorted out, take a closer listen to ""Canon""ù and ""Changes.""ù

science,UCLA Professor Speaks on Research Into Synaptic Reorganization in BMSE/MCDB Seminar,28-Oct-20,11:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-28/ucla-professor-speaks-on-research-into-synaptic-reorganization-in-bmse-mcdb-seminar/,"Rest is essential for all animals, human or nonhuman. Sleep, in particular, is important for many vital brain functions, such as mood, memory and cognition, while simultaneously ensuring the proper functioning of other body systems, like the immune and endocrine systems.† Drosophila melanogaster. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons However, the role of sleep in other areas, such as in response to neural injury, is less known. ""Although the circadian clock has been really well worked out, we really don't have a satisfying answer to how or why this homeostatic mechanism really occurs,""ù Jeffrey Donlea, a professor at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA, said.† ""We don't know many of the details about how the brain accounts for changes in sleep need, or perhaps more importantly, the restorative functions that are fulfilled during sleep when we rest at night,""ù Donlea said.† Donlea spoke to faculty, researchers and students at UCSB on Oct. 22 in a joint BMSE/MCDB seminar. He discussed his experimental studies into the role which sleep plays in injury and synaptic reorganization.† As a graduate student, Donlea carried out studies in flies where, following a period of social interaction, the flies experienced an increase in synaptic connections. This would be followed by a period in which the flies were especially tired and slept. Flies which slept returned to a baseline level of synaptic connections. However, if flies were kept awake instead, they retained an increased level of synaptic connections. ""These results and several others have led to this hypothesis that one thing sleep might be fulfilling is some kind of homeostatic downscaling or resetting of synaptic connections,""ù Donlea said.† One thing which sleep may do, according to Donlea, is scale back connections which are no longer needed or which are maladaptive. This process allows the nervous system to retain some plasticity. Following sleep and synaptic reorganization, one can continue with new learning. ""A problem the field has run into in trying to test this hypothesis is that on a daily basis, this kind of pruning may occur diffusely over large volumes of the brain,""ù Donlea said. ""It's really difficult to be able to predict which particular synapses might be affected by sleep. And so we've tried to look for other types of contexts in which we can locally target specific neurons for synaptic reorganization, or [a] time period that we can control acutely.""ù† In order to better understand the homeostatic processes of sleep, Donlea and his collaborators have been carrying out behavioral assays on drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly.† During these assays, the researchers load up flies into small glass tubes and place these into activity monitors, where flies throughout the testing period have their activity measured. Flies which are awake tend to alternate between eating food placed in the vessel and attempting to escape. Through movement in the flies, the activity sensors are able to detect when a fly is awake versus asleep. In one experiment, Donlea and his collaborators wanted to investigate the role of sleep in neural injury. They loaded up wild flies into a sleep monitor and gave the flies a couple days of baseline slumber. Following this, the flies were anesthetized one by one.† After the anesthesia of handling, one group of flies had their antennae removed, while another group retained their antennae. Both groups were loaded into monitors again. The researchers observed a large increase in daytime sleep among the flies which had had their antennas removed.† ""A day later, our injured flies go right back to baseline again and look like they restore their previous patterns of sleep and sleep the same as the control,""ù Donlea said.† ""This told us that there might be an interesting window or a period of time ""î that lasts for about 10 to 12 hours after injury ""î in which sleep might be facilitating recovery or reorganization in some way after you're injured.""ù The use of multi-beam monitors allowing for a finer-grained analysis gave the team even more confidence.† ""Initially, we were a little bit worried that maybe we weren't detecting sleep here and that we were detecting some other kind of freezing state or [a] state where the flies were in pain and not moving around normally. We've gone on to do some more precise analyses of what these flies are actually doing after injury,""ù Donlea said. Donlea and his collaborators have since carried out several experiments in order to parse out exactly how the removal of the antennae may influence sleep. In order to further confirm their suspicions, they have also investigated other factors which could serve as confounders. For instance, the researchers wanted to test whether increases in sleep they observed following antennae removal were due to damaged neurons, or instead due to the loss of olfactory cues which antennae relay to the brain in flies.† Donlea and his collaborators performed a test in which some flies would express a potassium channel to silence olfactory receptor neurons genetically.† ""What we would expect to see if the loss of smell was actually contributing to the increase in sleep was that our experimental flies would sleep more than our genetic controls. But that's not what we saw at all,""ù Donlea said. ""This is one piece of evidence that told us that it wasn't a loss of sensation, but it might be that [neural] damage itself that was promoting sleep.""ù† The researchers also have removed other parts of the flies to see if the increase in sleep is a generalized response due to tissue injury rather than damage to neurons, such as the maxillary palps (a smaller olfactory organ), the halteres (containing the vestibular system) and the wings.† They observed an increase in sleep following the removal of wings, but not the severing of either the maxillary palms or the halteres. ""This tells us that it's probably the increase in sleep that we see after antennal and wing injuries, probably not just a generalized tissue damage response, because otherwise we would see it after these other injury conditions as well,""ù Donlea said.

science,A Closer Look At California‚'s Iconic Oaks in Sedgwick Reserve,2-Nov-20,11:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-02/a-closer-look-into-californias-iconic-oaks-at-sedgwick-reserve/,"Amid sage scrub, grassland, valley oak savanna and blue oak woodland, the Sedgwick Reserve encompasses 9 square miles of land nestled in the upper Santa Ynez Valley. Blue oak, valley oak and coast live oak habitats find a confluence at Sedgwick. Courtesy of Frank Davis Sedgwick is one of 41 natural reserves held by the UC scattered all across the state. UC Santa Barbara manages Sedgwick and six others, including sites in the Sierra Nevada, South Coast and Channel Islands. In recent history, the reserve has been used to host university-level classes and a wide range of public activities. Even during the pandemic, researchers continue to frequent the reserve for data collection and long-term monitoring. ""[Sedgwick] is one of our biggest reserves in terms of land, size, use and programs ""¶ We have a really great biodiversity and range of habitats,""ù Kate McCurdy, who's been the natural reserve manager of Sedgwick for nearly 13 years, said during a seminar hosted by the UC Natural Reserve System on Oct. 29. Research in Sedgwick has delved into a variety of research topics, including fire regimes, the effects of grazers on the natural environment and various long-term monitoring projects. Sedgwick has also fueled forays into archaeological and geological research.† Following after McCurdy, Frank Davis, the inaugural director of the La Kretz Research Center at Sedgwick Reserve, discussed the varietal oak savanna and woodland habitats found at Sedgwick, as well as ongoing long-term monitoring under the Santa Barbara County Oak Restoration Project, an experimental plot which has been studied since 1994. ""[Oak savanna and woodland] occupy about 8% of California. They're in the warm and dry kind of bathtub ring around the central valley and interior valleys of the Coast Ranges, Transverse Ranges and Peninsular Ranges,""ù Davis said. Blue oak, valley oak and coast live oak habitats find a confluence at Sedgwick. Further inland, coast live oak vanish from the landscape. Meanwhile, as you approach the coast, sea spray creates an intolerable environment for valley oaks. Massive oaks, which live for several hundred years, dominate their ecosystems and underpin many crucial living processes. It is difficult to overstate the importance of oaks to the savannas and woodlands they make up. At Sedgwick, Davis and his collaborators have been studying oak regeneration on the decadal scale by performing experiments to examine how grazers and rodents affect oaks, while also examining historical photographs to get an understanding of how oaks and the landscape have changed over time.† ""It's a long-lived organism that doesn't lend itself well to being studied in terms of age structures. You can't really use pollen to get the resolution you need taxonomically. Tree rings would be nice but a lot of these oaks are rotten or hollow at the center, so you can't get ages, and many of them are difficult to core and get the ring structures,""ù Davis said. ""What we've been trying to do is combine the imagery with experimental results to model our way to an understanding of these populations.""ù† The researchers have established nested enclosures, for instance. These allow for studies into how animals act as controls on oak regeneration.† Adult trees produce lots of acorns during mast years, many of which are dispersed by scatter hoarders like scrub jays. However, much of the seedlings which grow initially will be eaten by other animals while they are still vulnerable. These threats can be compounded by drought.† ""The question then becomes: Well, we understand what is limiting the input of new seedlings and small trees; even if [the number of seedlings is] a small number, is it enough to offset the loss of the big trees? To do that we turn to aerial archival photography, beginning in 1938,""ù Davis said. Using the imagery to compare the numbers of coast live oak and valley oak over time yielded a fairly constant mortality rate across several decades. The researchers use a stochastic population matrix model to quantify the impacts of these consumers and combine them with observed mortality.† ""[The stochastic population matrix model] predicts that there'd be a steady decline of oak if they were exposed to all of the different consumers ""¶ [But] if you keep the cattle and the deer out, you start to see a shift that's actually significant enough where our projected population growth would increase ,""ù Davis said.† However, heat and drought may soon play a bigger role in oak mortality and population growth ""î or its decline. There was an abrupt shift coinciding with the 2011-17 California drought ""î one of the most intense in California history.† ""We live in Santa Barbara, you know. It's all over the place. We have wet years and dry years, and they bounce back and forth. But what's interesting about this most recent drought is it was a string of six very dry years,""ù Davis said. ""So that begs the question of whether we've actually entered into a new kind of climate regime that might have accelerating effects on the mortality rates of these oaks.""ù The impacts of climate in Sedgwick go beyond drought, however. Increased variability of climate and a reduction in the number of good seedling establishment years pose a challenge to oaks. Indirect effects of climate, such as wildfires and, potentially, insect outbreaks, are also subjects of considerable interest among researchers.† ""What's the relationship between oak persistence and resilience and fire regimes, and so forth? I think these are big unanswered questions right now that we need to really start to think hard about,""ù Davis said.

Interpreters switch their minds between two or sometimes multiple languages constantly due to the requirements of their job. Ferreira has worked on this research since 2016. Christian Wad / Noun Project Different from translators, who are not required to translate under time pressure, interpreters are required to convert one language to another during verbal conversations within a set amount of time.† One might consider interpreters bilingual. However, the definition of bilingual does not include language proficiency; variability between individual interpreters makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions for researchers investigating the advantages of bilingualism.† A question of whether or not there are cognitive and neurocognitive effects for interpreters or bilinguals has been a popular topic among research studies on bilingualism. However, not many studies have looked specifically into the long-term cognitive and neurocognitive effects of being an interpreter.†† Aline Ferreira, an associate professor from the UCSB Department of Spanish and Portuguese and the director of the Bilingualism, Translation, and Cognition Laboratory, has been working with bilinguals since 2010. Investigating written translation from a first language into a second language, Ferreira conducted a research study with two other researchers, John W. Schwieter and Julia Festman, published as ""Cognitive and Neurocognitive Effects From the Unique Bilingual Experiences of Interpreters.""ù Ferreira has worked on this research since 2016. The paper gives a comprehensive review on topics such as the definition of bilingualism and interpretation, the theory of interpreting studies, the effects of interpreting training and the cognitive and neurocognitive effects of interpreters by reviewing a number of research studies done by other researchers on topics regarding interpreting and bilingualism. ""Colleagues from all around the world have been contributing to better explain bilingualism,""ù Ferreira said.† Some studies suggested that interpreters show high performance in semantic error detection and short-term memory advantages due to their sensitivity of semantic features and memorization skills developed through interpreting experiences. Other studies argued that the unique bilingual language experiences of interpreters show a significant contribution to ""mental set shifting enhancement in cognitive control but not to inhibition.""ù Among the studies discussed in this paper on whether or not there is a cognitive advantage for interpreters, ""Elmer and colleagues (2014) and Abutalebi and colleagues (2014, 2015)'s findings were two of the most significant,""ù Ferreira wrote in an email to the Nexus.† Elmer and colleagues found that professional interpreters seem to show a specific neuroanatomical and neurofunctional profile of verbal and non-verbal processes. Abutalebi and colleagues (2014, 2015)'s findings showed that changes in gray matter density have been observed as reflections of life-long bilingualism. Ferreira and the two other researchers agree that a ""defined conclusion has not yet been drawn""ù due to the variability of the individual interpreter experiences. In other words, whether or not there is a cognitive advantage due to the bilingual experiences of interpreters is still in debate and needs further investigation. ""We have walked a long path since the ""speculative theorizing""ù, as called by Gile (1990)**, and we have borrowed from other fields to create new studies and address issues that have been explained in several models, but never tested. Maybe it is time to test those theories and have a better description of participants' bilingual profiles,""ù Ferreira said. For future studies, it is suggested that a ""more precise measure of professional experience should be used.""ù For instance, including a more detailed description of the participants' past experiences could possibly help provide a more certain conclusion.†† ""I will conduct further research. As we keep working on the designs, participants' recruitment, and data analyses, we might find other ways to answer the questions that we have and probably ask even more questions,""ù Ferreira said.

science,"In Search of Effective Conservation Strategies, Researchers Studying Amphibian Disease Look to Natural Resistance",13-Nov-20,11:30 AM,['Katherine Sheng'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-13/in-search-of-effective-conservation-strategies-researchers-studying-amphibian-disease-look-to-natural-resistance/,"In recent years, the world has seen a decrease in biodiversity. Countless species of plants and animals have gone extinct, with human activities being a major cause. Amphibians, specifically, have been facing the consequences of global trade through chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd).† Researchers use skin swab techniques to sample frogs for Bd. Courtesy of Laura Brannelly Chytridiomycosis is ""the most important wildlife disease in the past century,""ù Laura Brannelly, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne who has been researching diseases like chytridiomycosis for the past 10 years, wrote, ""Over 500 species have been affected by chytridiomycosis and it is the primary cause of 90 species to become extinct.""ù† Not every population reacts to disease in the same way. A myriad of factors affect resistance, how easily an individual contracts a disease, and tolerance, how affected an individual is by the disease. These factors include genetics, population density, behavior and climate, among many others. Why do some species survive? Can we prevent the extinction of other species? These questions are investigated in a recent synthesis paper by Brannelly and her colleagues, including UC Santa Barbara's own Cheryl Briggs, a professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology.† The researchers analyzed past studies of chytridiomycosis in a variety of amphibian populations. Knowing how amphibians resist the disease can help scientists determine how to help them survive. Although ways to keep species from succumbing to chytridiomycosis has been researched before, ""management options are rarely framed in terms of supporting the mechanisms of population persistence that the animals are naturally using in the face of the disease,""ù according to Brannelly. ""In this review, we aimed to overview how management can support the natural mechanisms of persistence,""ù Brannelly said. In other words, the researchers focused on ways to support a population's natural ability to survive a disease as opposed to trying to introduce an entirely new method. ""When management supports these natural mechanisms, it will lead to more successful management outcomes and fewer failures,""ù Brannelly added. The research team used data from studies used in another review as well as a number of more recent studies examining chytridiomycosis in amphibian species. Then, they created a model to compare the results from these studies and draw conclusions. However, directly comparing research done by different labs is difficult because of differences in methodology. For example, labs might use different amphibian species to test resistance to chytridiomycosis, or the experiment might cover one generation or many.† ""Because each experimental infection design was slightly different, we controlled for temperature, dose and days post-inoculation in our model so that the results could be comparable among species and life stages,""ù Brannelly explained. Then, it was possible for the researchers to detect trends in population persistence after exposure to the disease.† So what do we know now? Mostly, that we don't know enough. Immunity ""î either genetic or acquired ""î was long thought to be the main reason that some species survived chytridiomycosis better than others, Brannelly said. However, Brannelly and her team found that immunity, tested in a lab setting, is not a reliable indicator of how the tested species fared in the wild. Therefore, there must be other significant factors that influence a population's resistance, and they should be taken into account. According to Brannelly, there needs to be more research into ways that frogs survive this disease.† ""There are very few species that have been adequately tested,""ù Brannelly said. ""This could be because understanding mechanisms of persistence are challenging, where a number of mechanisms could be in play.""ù Despite this, the researchers laid out a number of options for population management based on their findings. Potential courses of action include encouraging breeding or compensating for the effects of fires or droughts. Brannelly warns against being hasty with the delicate process of population management, especially given the current lack of understanding regarding the best ways for populations to survive: ""This means we might be guessing which management options to use and guessing could lead to exacerbating declines.""ù Conducting more research on chytridiomycosis and Bd won't just help scientists protect amphibians; understanding how frogs survive disease can help us support other species. If, for instance, scientists determine that a specific intervention ""î like manipulating a habit to encourage breeding, or mixing in members from a more resistant population ""î promotes survival under certain conditions, then that intervention could be applied to other, non-amphibian species infected with disease.† ""The mechanisms of persistence are generally important for all wildlife disease systems. The management options we laid out are broadly applicable to other disease systems as well,""ù Brannelly said. ""Regardless of the disease system, it is important to understand the natural ways the animals are persisting with endemic disease and support those mechanisms through management practices.

Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-13/the-scientists-declassified-guide-to-talking-about-climate-change/,"The choice of whether or not to discuss the dreaded topic of climate change at the Thanksgiving table isn't a new dilemma. Everyone tenses up as your cousin starts their rant again about the ""conspiracy""ù of climate change. Your palms start to sweat. You feel like you need to say something ""î right? ""No politics at the dinner table""ù just doesn't sit right with you anymore. Climate change is a fact based on rigorous research conducted across many fields of science. But if this conversation blows up, it's not the kind of situation your sibling's famous pumpkin pie just smooths over. Joyce Tsui / Daily Nexus Does this situation sound familiar to you? Then you might be suffering from what we call, ""How do I talk to my loved one about climate change?!""ù syndrome. This guide has been prepared for you by UC Santa Barbara scientists to assist you through the next few months of family and friend get-togethers. You know what our planet is facing, but how do you communicate the facts? How do you meet your relatives and friends where they are? How do you maintain this relationship when the future of our planet is at risk? This guide is not a cure-all for a climate change denier. Rather, the hope is that you will find tools to help you feel better equipped to engage in disagreements and gain a deeper understanding of your loved ones, find common ground and maybe even guide them in the direction of truth. Through these conversations you ""î better than any scientist ""î have the opportunity to find and address misinformation, misunderstanding and fear. Here are the facts to get us on the same page. First, unlike rhetoric heard from the Trump administration, one cannot ""believe""ù in climate change. Climate change is not a religion, and science is not a faith. There is extensive research and data supporting the reality of climate change. However, climate change is a very complex issue to understand and mitigate. Thus, there is an equally complex and multi-layered continuum of knowledge and attitudes one can have about climate change and climate change action.† Second, scientific evidence shows that ""î as one element of the changing global climate ""î humans have already raised the planet's average surface temperature by about 1∞C (1.8∞F). The scientific community agrees that these changes are largely due to human emissions. In the highest emissions scenarios modeled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its last report, global mean temperature could increase by over 4∞C (7.2∞F) by the end of the century. †Global surface temperature (degrees Celsius) change in projections under various emission scenarios. Courtesy of IPCC David Lea, distinguished professor, climate advocate and climate researcher in the UCSB Earth Science Department, illustrated the magnitude of change with a comparison: ""The Earth, as a whole, cooled by about 5∞C during the ice ages. About half of it was due to a greenhouse gas reduction.""ù This data shows that atmospheric processes ""î exactly like the ones humans are contributing to now ""î led to massive changes to our planet's climate.† ""An ice age is a really big change ""¶ there were ice sheets stretching from Seattle to Long Island,""ù Lea said.† Another important distinction is that patterns of local and regional weather do not equate to those of the global climate across a long period of time. While weather refers to the day-to-day precipitation or temperature, climate refers to the weather averaged over a period of 30 years. So, while some places will experience some cold weather abnormalities, this is not evidence that contradicts climate change. The planet as a whole is warming, and it is virtually certain that cold extremes will decrease over time. Everyone can and will feel these alterations firsthand.†† Finally, our current climate change is substantially caused by human consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting emissions. The burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution has greatly increased the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere (carbon dioxide by 47% and methane by 250%). These additional gases are some of the best at trapping incoming solar radiation, warming our planet like a car with rolled-up windows on a summer afternoon. To continue with this car analogy, you are now starting to feel the rising heat, you cannot roll down the windows and, for whatever reason, some of your fellow passengers refuse to acknowledge the increasing heat. If you do not figure out how to talk to them, everyone will suffer the consequences. How do you start a conversation about climate change? Understanding and common connections. The first goal of this conversation is to establish common ground ""î don't bring up facts right away. Why and how do you establish common ground? For the same reason you are the one who needs to broach the topic of climate change. You are family. You are a friend. What values do you agree on? For some, this might be a responsibility to future generations to maintain the same wilderness and quality of life. For others, this might be a fear of the loss of stability in the future with increasing natural disasters or the instability of our coastal communities with sea-level rise. These are places where you can test the waters. Start to listen for the exact ways in which your loved one reasons through their denial of the reality of climate change. Listen to what your loved one thinks, what they fear and, importantly, where you agree. †Lea is currently working on a study focused on decarbonizing California's transportation sector. As part of this work, he led a workshop last year in Bakersfield, the heart of much of the state's oil industry. There, he found himself surrounded by climate change deniers. Lea chose to listen. At the end of their discussion he offered constructive advice where he thought it would be helpful: ""In the end they said ""òWe like you because you're open minded.' You have to be human and sympathetic and recognize the places you can make progress and other places you're just not going to sell people,""ù Lea said.† Tamma Carleton, an assistant professor and researcher at UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and a leading researcher in the Climate Impact Lab, has had similar experiences with climate change deniers. ""The unhelpful instinct that I have found in myself is to turn on my professor hat and start lecturing about all the things I know. That doesn't create a conversation. A fire hose of information is not convincing if it isolates you from your conversation partner,""ù Carleton recommended. ""Try to meet your conversation partner on the level that they're at and provide information when it's helpful or asked for.""ù So, this is where you begin. Set the stage for a productive conversation by first understanding where your loved one is coming from. From this place of understanding, you can then challenge falsehoods while acknowledging the fear, the anger and the unknown. Below, I have compiled a short list of some of the many arguments, from many, you may face. Denial argument 1: Climate change isn't real ""î it's a hoax. Those who completely deny the reality of climate change are† a shrinking percentage of the population. ""We need to keep in mind that the ardent climate deniers [in the United States] are a small population. By most recent reports it was 11% and it's declined to 7% over the last five years""¶ researchers refer to this group as ""òdisproportionately influential,'""ù Ronald Rice, a professor and researcher of environmental communication and the Arthur N. Rupe Chair in the Social Effects of Mass Communication in UCSB's Department of Communication since 2004, said. Rice is referring to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication's report on Global Warming's Six Americas, a survey in the United States on the variability of awareness, understanding and acceptance of climate change. This kind of outright denial may not be a position you can completely shift, but there are still opportunities to connect. First, climate change is agreed upon and supported by several organizations, industries and scientific institutions around the world and across party lines. Even top oil industries that profit from fossil fuel consumption agree that climate change requires action, including BP, ExxonMobil, Shell and more. Thus, the first opportunity lies in finding a source that your loved one trusts. Otherwise, ""it's easy to deny source credibility if you already disagree with [the fact],""ù explained Rice. Considering this information, Rice invited a retired admiral from the U.S. Navy for a science communication conference he helped organize in 2013. The admiral warned of the danger to naval bases from sea-level rise and the implications for national security as a whole. Rice described the invitation as an opportunity to provide ""an interesting argument that doesn't speak to economic issues, but speaks to other kinds of issues that are very salient to conservative deniers.""ù The key here is to find other climate advocates who your loved one would inherently trust based on shared values and goals. †Other connections that can be made with an outright denier are the more visceral and immediate effects of climate change, which are† evident in the increasing number of natural disasters and lives lost. ""The amount of emissions that we've already put into the atmosphere means that climate change is happening. It's no longer an issue that you have to say, let's talk about our grandkids,""ù noted Carleton, whose lab quantifies today's socioeconomic costs of climate change.† Californians have felt an onslaught of these impacts in the last decade with prolonged drought and unrelenting fire seasons. The impacts have immediate and visible effects on our state's physical safety and food security. Yes, we have mismanaged our fire-adapted forests with decades of fire suppression, and we have continued to build our cities and homes without buffer into our chaparral and wooded spaces. However, there is no doubt ""î our warmed climate has dried out our green spaces so severely that they are ready to burn with the tiniest spark. In reality, everyone will experience or is already experiencing the effects of climate change: homes lost to fires, hurricanes and rising sea-levels; decreased water access with changing precipitation patterns; reduced crop production with water loss and increased temperature; higher mortality from rising temperatures ""î the list goes on. Denial argument 2: Sure, climate is changing, but it's a natural process. The idea of climate being a human-caused phenomenon is daunting. It may create conflicting emotions of anger or shame, as accepting that climate change is caused by humans would also mean accepting responsibility or guilt. Moreover, a challenge in understanding climate change is the scale of the problem. How can we imagine the history of the Earth's climate when we have only witnessed our own lifetimes? How can we grasp the entire globe's climate when we can only experience where we are? The opportunity to connect here is thinking about what we know about human activities and then expanding to the research.† The scale to which humans have changed the environment is shocking, but it is not impossible to fathom. Look at every continent on the planet ""î no other animal has been capable of the kind of infrastructure and ecosystem engineering humans have accomplished in the last several hundred years.† ""Just take a look at a picture of the Earth from space at night,""ù Lea said. ""The fact that CO2 has been elevated in the air that is everywhere ""î there is no untouched part of the planet ""¶ we are everywhere. We are in everything.""ù According to the last report released by the IPCC in 2014, climate researchers agree that it is extremely likely that the majority of the observed warming can only be accounted for with human activity. Moreover, over 97% of scientists agree with this finding across thousands of peer-reviewed publications. ""We can confidently demonstrate that the degree to which we've altered the composition of the atmosphere is in agreement with the warming we see,""ù Lea said. When modeling the causes of observed warming, natural processes like solar radiation, internal planet warming and other theories do not account for the Earth's current warming. Here you can connect lines of thinking. Human activity is responsible for increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution. These greenhouse gases are the dominant driver of observed and projected climate change. Observed warming (in degrees Celsius) and possible attributing factors. Courtesy of IPCC. First, agree that humans have impacted the entire globe in very visible ways. Then, challenge misinformation with the consensus of the vast majority of the scientific community, who agree that it is extremely likely (over 95% probability) that this warming is a largely the result of human emissions. Denial argument 3: How can we be sure that climate change is real if scientists themselves aren't sure?† Throughout the Trump Administration, our president and vice president dismissed or misinterpreted the scientific understanding of climate change. This is not accidental. Over the last four years, the Trump Administration has routinely undermined and questioned science by using the complicated idea of uncertainty to their advantage. However, the different sources of uncertainty are well-addressed by climate researchers and they should be acknowledged. First, uncertainty can lie in the precision of tools used by researchers. Confidence intervals and estimates do their best to account for these unknowns and give us as much reason and reliability as possible. Rice explained, ""For instance, if you look at climate predictions, they're going to give you a range ""¶ for example, ""òwe're actually 95% confident that it's going to be in this range.'""ù Carleton added that modelers give these ranges of estimates ""to explicitly try to capture those forms of uncertainty.""ù† Second, uncertainty lies in the future and the unknowables like human behavior and the unpredictability of climate systems. Carleton said, ""You should be worried about uncertainty, because this is a very complicated problem that requires us to think about the future, which is inherently challenging. However,""ù she continued, ""we should be reassured that hundreds and thousands of researchers are focused on this problem. With dramatic explosions of data and computing power, we've been able to make a lot of progress on narrowing those uncertainties.""ù Third, uncertainty can also lie in consensus. However, this is not an issue for climate researchers. Scientists are not uncertain that the climate is changing. As mentioned above, 97% or more of published papers agree that humans are the dominant cause of climate change. Scientific organizations from nearly 200 different countries endorse this position. Scientists are sure. Uncertainty is a subject of great importance to climate researchers, but the sources are understood and the margins of unknown are decreasing every day. What you're up against: a mindset rather than a misunderstanding. In summary, climate change is happening. We can see this with our own eyes ""î there is scientific evidence and worldwide consensus. Given the evidence and media coverage available at the click of a button, climate change denial often stems from something more complex than just not being aware of the facts.† Climate change has, unfortunately, become a partisan issue when it is in fact a nonpartisan reality. Often, a person's political affiliation can inform their view on climate change. Much like the public's understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a disconnect between the facts of the situation and the actions necessary to solving that issue.† To engage with others, one needs to know more about the mindset that forms and enforces climate change denial. As Eric Smith, professor and researcher in environmental policy and public opinion with the UCSB Political Science Department, said, our opinions are formed ""mostly from our parents, our friends, our coworkers, in college and beyond.""ù Thus, the people and the media people choose to surround themselves with are vital to their understanding of the world and their ability to accept ideas.† ""They hear maybe from friends, maybe on the radio about climate change being a hoax and they easily believe it. Partly because [they are] surrounded by people who are exactly like them, and they don't get a real exchange of views ""î and that's true on both sides,""ù Smith said.† In thinking again about Global Warming's Six Americas, Rice warned that, ""on the other side, the percentage of Amerians alarmed by climate change has risen to just 26% ""¶ that's outrageous.""ù And he's right. There are too many people spread across the spectrum of climate change denial or dismissal. And while the most ardent deniers may be too hard to reach, if close to 70% of the population is not on board with climate action, there is still much work to be done in order to avoid catastrophe. †The importance of these conversations cannot be understated. We need to normalize discussing these contentious topics. We need to normalize feeling uncomfortable and pushing ourselves and others out of our respective comfort zones. These conversations spark real change. Reason for hope. Researchers I spoke with for this piece are hopeful about our future. But where do they find hope in a sea of inaction and denial? Well, for one, in everyday Earthlings' growing awareness of climate change. When you first read the title of this article, you likely had no doubt to what problem it references. What with all of the serious and urgent conversations surrounding climate action, it can be difficult to see the progress that has been made. This is a small but important marker of how climate change activists have moved the needle forward in recent years. ""I've looked at trust in scientists. I've looked at a lot of knowledge about sustainability [and] climate change. All those trends are moving into what I think of as a good direction. But public opinion isn't enough alone to, at least in the short term, change things. We need people in office who accept science,""ù Smith explained. Individual awareness needs to be pushed toward knowledge and understanding. Only when we are all informed can we move toward policy and legislation that creates real change. If climate action is a legacy we want to leave for future generations, climate conversations are more important than ever. And while your family might end up eating pumpkin pie in silence this year after things get a little too heated, there is room to learn and practice as we navigate these difficult discussions. Let your loved ones know that this is not a partisan issue ""î this is everyone's planet and everyone's future. Let your loved one know that you are a person who cares enough to talk with them and walk with them through the facts. Let them know that you are ready to talk when they are ready.

science,UCSB Professor Wins NIH Award to Study Navigational Neurons in Fruit Flies,17-Nov-20,11:45 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-17/ucsb-professor-wins-nih-award-to-study-navigational-neurons-in-fruit-flies/,"Sung Soo Kim, an assistant professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, recently won the prestigious National Institutes of Health Director's New Innovator Award, a $1.5 million grant ""î awarded over a period of five years ""î which Kim will be able to put towards his further research into the systems that create an animal's sense of direction. A tethered fly under a two-photon laser scanning microscope. Courtesy of Bryan James Kim's research specifically focuses on the fly brain, or rather, the neurons within the fly brain which allow the fly to navigate their surroundings. He has been working on research involving Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, for about nine years. In mammals, a set of neurons known as head direction cells are responsible for maintaining and updating our sense of direction. These give the brain the information of traction we need to function in our daily lives.† Such neurons have piqued the interest of computational neuroscientists for quite some time. In recent years researchers have developed models to show how these neurons involved with navigation may collect visual information and translate this into a sense of direction.† ""They came up with a really beautiful mathematical model. In this model, you see that individual neurons are aligned in a circle. There is a beautiful parametric connection between them,""ù Kim said.† Doubt existed among scientists who believed that such a model could not possibly exist in real life.† However, the Jayaraman Lab at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which Kim previously worked at, discovered compass neurons existing in the small and simple brain of the fruit fly. These compass neurons are arranged in a circular pattern, with the behavior of the compass neurons consistent with what computational modeling had yielded in its attempts to explain head direction cells in mammals.†† ""That was a big shock to the field,""ù Kim said.† During an interview with Kim, I was asked to entertain a hypothetical to better understand the processes he has been studying.† ""Imagine that you close your eyes. You can't see anything right now. I can bet, however, that you will still be able to find your way to the door. Right?""ù ""The reason is that your brain is updating your sense of direction. So, even if you close your eyes, you know where you are. And if you move around the room, you know where you are and you know where you are looking,""ù Kim said.† Kim is aiming to examine the means by which visual information is combined in the compass neurons of the fly. In order to do this, Kim and his collaborators have been experimentally mapping the behavior of compass neurons to various stimuli.† Essentially, in Kim's lab, flies are hooked up to ""virtual reality""ù via an LED screen. These flies are simultaneously tethered to allow researchers to observe both changes in the wingbeat amplitude of flies ""î in the case of flying ""î or the rotation of a ball a fly is standing on ""î in the case of walking. The visual stimuli a fly is exposed to affects how the visual stimuli changes in response.† While this is happening, a two-photon laser scanning microscope allows researchers to monitor the activity of the fly's neurons while the fly is moving around.† ""You can actually record from those neurons and see where the fly is headed just by looking at those neurons,""ù Kim said.† ""So by matching the fly's behavior within the virtual reality arena, and the compass neuron's activity, you can do very interesting things like see how those neurons are connected.""ù† Through this, Kim specifically intends to gain an understanding of the manner in which landmarks are selected by the brain in order to establish a sense of direction.† In order to do so, Kim must understand how visual information is processed in the brain, how this processed information is fed into the brain and how compass neurons employ this information to gain a footing on their sense of direction.† Now, with a new injection of funding, Kim and his collaborators will be able to further invest in new equipment, get more people on the project and refine their visual stimuli. ""I'm still studying these compasses, still using this experimental setup. The difference is that, [before], the visual scene was relatively simple. Now, I'm going to show the fly many different scenes and see how those kinds of different visual scenes are processed to generate a sense of direction in the fly,""ù Kim said.

science,"The Future of Forests in the Warming, Drying American West",18-Nov-20,11:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-18/the-future-of-trees-in-the-warming-drying-american-west/,"In the modern era, forests play a crucial role in the sequestration of carbon emissions and are factored mathematically into carbon offsets, which are reductions of carbon emissions which compensate for emissions made elsewhere, such as transportation and power generation.† A landscape affected by widespread tree mortality in the mountains of New Mexico. Courtesy of Curt Dvonch ""What's particularly relevant about terrestrial ecosystems and forests in particular, is that they sequester about 30% of anthropogenic emissions every year. They're this huge resource in terms of mitigating climate change,""ù Anna Trugman, a researcher at the Earth Research Institute and a professor in the Department of Geography at UC Santa Barbara said.† However, fires, insect infestations and other major disturbances have shed light on an important issue forests ""îparticularly in the American West""î have been facing: mass die-offs which may even kill forests, releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere, turning forests into emitters themselves and fueling a positive feedback loop.† It is an issue unfortunately very familiar to Californians: catastrophic fires. The 2020 California fire season burned the most acreage on record in a single season in modern history by far, nearly 4.5 million acres, dwarfing the 2018 California fire season, which clocked in at a little under 2 million acres. ""If we want to use forests as part of a portfolio of climate mitigation strategies, it really needs to be carefully considered how different disturbances that are in and of themselves, related to climate change and may increase in frequency, might harm the integrity of these forest carbon sinks,""ù Trugman said.† With the current and projected future impacts of climate change, which has dried landscapes through drought and heat, researchers are attempting to formulate a method to effectively predict how tree species in the west may likely respond to the major stressors of the future.† ""We are seeing evidence for major things like drought-driven mortality events and obviously these really widespread fires that have a lot of potential for causing catastrophic shifts in species composition,""ù Trugman said.† In an attempt to better understand how climate change will affect future forest ecosystems, Trugman, along with her collaborators at the University of Utah, have been studying whether or not forest die-off may be predicted by modeling water stress incurred by the hydraulic system of trees, a water transport mechanism in the tree stem made up of tissues known as xylem.† ""Water travels along water potential gradients from the soil, through the plant and is eventually transpired in the atmosphere. You have to have [a] more negative water potential [gradient] to pull this water up from the soil,""ù Trugman said.† However, when water is scarce in the environment, the water potential gradient in a tree becomes increasingly negative to compensate and maintain the necessary upward movement of water through a tree.† As this gradient becomes increasingly negative, trees become more and more stressed and may even incur long-term damage or death. Different trees have different abilities they can employ to cope with stress and continue photosynthesizing even under severe drought, but even the most resilient trees have a breaking point. The researchers utilized a forest inventory data set, a network of more than 160,000 single-species forested plots, largely concentrated in the western United States and measured at fixed intervals starting from 2000 to present day. Trugman and her collaborators referenced records of tree mortality and compared these to their own modeling.† ""We coupled that with a prognostic model that predicts plant water stress and, in particular, can predict when plants are so stressed that they should die based on input climate, across these different places,""ù Trugman said. ""And so this model represents our best understanding of the mechanisms that induce tree mortality through water stress.""ù† However, the researchers observed that, although the model has been able to make accurate predictions in controlled experiments in previous studies, it was actually less effective in predicting mortality at the landscape scale using the data set.† ""What we found is that physiology is very important in understanding forest mortality, but we are still missing some key mechanisms in being able to predict it at large spatial scales,""ù Trugman said. ""[Something] that wasn't taken into account in this study is that you can also have a lot of co-occurring pests or pathogens ""î which was completely absent from our model.""ù These can drive mortality, amplifying stress in some trees and even killing off less stressed trees which ordinarily might face no threats to their continued survival in the absence of pests.† ""This probably explains why we're having so much trouble scaling up this physiological understanding from a very controlled environment to this larger scale,""ù Trugman said.

science,"With a Winter Wave Looming Large, UCSB Enters Into COVID-19 Smartphone Exposure Notification Pilot Program",27-Nov-20,12:40 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-27/with-a-winter-wave-looming-large-ucsb-enters-into-covid-19-smartphone-exposure-notification-pilot-program/,"In the wake of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, UC Santa Barbara Student Health was bracing itself for an incredible surge in cases across the university's student body and the surrounding community of Isla Vista. Luckily, this surge never fully materialized, leaving Isla Vista in a bubble as cases soared across the country and lockdowns were implemented in several states, including California.† Study rooms at Santa Catalina Residence Hall with limited capacity during the initial springtime wave of COVID-19. Sicheng Wang / Daily Nexus Ali Javanbakht, medical director of UCSB Student Health, sees reasons for this. Although Isla Vista may seem like a poster child for irresponsible college communities, with a dense and young population that has difficulties with being consistent about wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding gatherings, there is another factor which serves to limit the spread of COVID-19 both to Isla Vista and from Isla Vista.† According to Javanbakht, people in Isla Vista are largely confined within the community limits. There isn't as much movement to and from other places as seen in some bedroom communities elsewhere in the county. For the most part, students don't commute far outside of I.V. to go to work and then return in the afternoon; this serves to limit the geographic spread of COVID-19, Javanbakht says.† Isla Vista and communities in the rest of the county have since volleyed back and forth in their roles as the primary drivers contributing to COVID-19's once-again rapid rise in the area and Santa Barbara County's push to the purple tier, according to Javanbakht. ""The numbers have definitely gone up. But it's always been this kind of fluctuation of rise and then a plateau, and then a drop off and then a rise. I'm getting ready to continue to see that,""ù Javanbakht said.† ""I think we have a group of students who choose to engage in risky behavior ""î big gatherings without wearing a mask ""î but it is a smaller percentage. Most students really want to do the right thing. But it's that small percentage that's really driving those numbers.""ù† Even today, while numerous students in I.V. have tested positive for COVID-19 over several waves and there are currently 28 people in I.V. with active COVID-19 cases, none have become acutely ill and none have died.† However, I.V. has seen one death; the decedent was between 50 and 69 years old and was ""associated with a congregate care facility.""ù† ""If we're able to really implement good, strong consistent measures here, it could well be that we really drop those numbers down lower than it is in most other places in the area, the county or the state,""ù Javanbakht said. ""But for that to happen, there needs to be a very strong, robust infrastructure of doing what needs to be done, which means getting masks out there, getting all the businesses involved really enforcing six-foot distancing and having consequences for people who don't follow, having a really strong marketing messaging presence ""î right in the heart of Isla Vista. We don't have any of that.""ù† While there is a very large community interest in testing in Isla Vista and capacity has improved compared to in the early stages of the pandemic, the county still struggles to provide adequate testing to match demand, according to Javanbakht. To supplement traditional means to contain the spread, such as testing and contract tracing, UCSB has entered into the California COVID Notify pilot program, alongside UC San Diego, UC San Francisco Health, UC Davis, UC Berkeley, the Berkeley Lab, UC Los Angeles and UC Riverside. California COVID Notify is a smartphone exposure notification system intended to limit the spread of COVID-19 by alerting users if they may have been exposed to another person in the system who themselves has tested positive for the virus.† Katie Mankins, the director for special projects at UCSB, has been closely involved in the implementation of California COVID Notify at UCSB, acting as the campus lead and coordinating with the UCSB COVID-19 Response Team. She also distributes keys that are used by infected individuals to notify other potential contacts in the system of their positive test results.† According to Mankins, a significant advantage of COVID Notify compared to standard contact tracing is that it provides an earlier notification of potential exposures and doesn't rely on people's recollection of who they have come into contact with. Instead, people are informed of potential exposures based on proximity. When phones with the app have Bluetooth enabled, they log other phones in the service which they come into contact with using a random identification number. Besides this numeric key, the app doesn't log any information regarding the location of the contact or the identity of the other users.† ""When somebody contacts you to do contact tracing interviews after you've gotten a positive diagnosis ""¶ that might be, you know, a couple days after that original test [result] ""¶ if you're using the app and you decide you want to share your positive test result with other users, the app is giving people you may have been in contact with an earlier notification of the potential exposure,""ù Mankins said.† ""[Also], when you're doing a traditional contact tracing interview, you're being asked questions about, ""òWhere were you?

science,"At Valentine Camp, a Plan is Hatched to Fix California‚'s Drought-stressed, Overstuffed Forests",1-Dec-20,1:30 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-01/at-valentine-camp-a-plan-is-hatched-to-fix-californias-drought-stressed-overstuffed-forests/,"For thousands of years, wildfires annually crept through millions of acres in California's forests and shrubland. Set alight both incidentally and intentionally, through lightning strikes and Native American cultural burning, these burns were often beneficial for plants, people and wildlife.† VESR has a variety of habitats including montane forests, meadows, riparian zones and sagebrush. Courtesy of Carol Blanchette In the open forests of the Sierra Nevada, for instance, fire served to clear out understory vegetation, prevent the overcrowding and encroachment of conifers and encourage the future growth of food plants, like acorns and tubers.† However, the arrival of European settlers put an end to this arrangement. Fires were difficult to control and dangerous to the settlers, with the capability of destroying whole communities in one fell swoop.† Already racist and disdainful toward Native Americans, settlers established new regulations and carried out forced relocation and acculturation programs. Cultural burning was limited by such practices.† Meanwhile, a massive and disastrous fire in 1910, the Big Blowup, tore through three million acres of forested land in Montana and Idaho over two days. In its aftermath, a policy of total fire suppression became gospel for decades in the United States Forest Service.† Now, in one 155-acre plot of land in Mammoth Lakes, researchers with the University of California are trying to better understand how California's forests can be rehabilitated through both selective burning and thinning in the wake of monster fires and climate change.† Located in just about the middle of Mammoth Lakes, in the wildland-urban interface, Valentine Eastern Sierra Reserves (VESR) is one of two reserves managed by UC Santa Barbara in the eastern Sierra, along with the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory.† ""Valentine has a really unique property ""¶ It's never been logged or grazed, and it actually supports one of the highest diversity of plant communities in [the] Sierra Nevada,""ù VESR Director Carol Blanchette said.† VESR has a wide variety of habitats in its bounds, including montane forests, meadows, riparian zones and sagebrush. Of particular interest to fire ecologists are the montane forests.† ""Studies using some of the old trees have shown that forest fires were really common events in this area, prior to human development ""¶ [However,] there are widespread practices of fire suppression that have prevented these fires,""ù Blanchette said. ""This has resulted in forests with high densities of trees that are vulnerable to the effects of drought, pathogens and wildfire.""ù In the final UC-wide natural reserve seminar of the quarter, Hugh Safford, a UC Davis researcher and regional ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service, and Ashley Grupenhoff, a researcher in Safford's lab, spoke of their research and ecological restoration work in VESR.† Ecologists carrying out fieldwork in the conifer forests of VESR. Courtesy of Carol Blanchette According to Safford, California's pronounced Mediterranean climate is the reason for its susceptibility to fires. Ample rain and snow in the winter allows for the extensive growth of vegetation. Then summer comes, and the relentless heat and sun dry out all of this fuel.† However, not all fires behave the same across the landscape. In chaparral, fires are infrequent, ""but when they burn, they really burn,""ù as Safford said.† In contrast, many montane forests thrive best when they have frequent and low-intensity fires. The principal vegetation fueling these are found in the understory, including saplings, low herbaceous cover and litter, while dominant large trees typically emerge from a fire unscathed. ""In the natural state, fire is not a transformational factor in these forests; rather, it's a factor that maintains forest composition structure,""ù Safford said.† During summer 2019, Safford and a crew of international foresters conducted common stand exams. These measured overstory and understory tree diversity, shrub cover and total fuel loading ""î vital information for gauging both forest conditions and the effectiveness of fuel treatments. Meanwhile, Scott Stephens, a UC Berkeley professor who studies the interaction between wildland fires and ecosystems, conducted research that deduced fire return intervals in VESR, with lower-elevation mixed conifer forest burning roughly once every nine years, and higher upper montane forests burning roughly every 25 years.† ""Fire was historically common in this area, yet the last fire that burned here occurred around 130 years ago. This has major implications for both standard structure and species composition across the landscape,""ù Grupenhoff said.† In order to compensate for the lack of fire on the landscape, researchers at VESR carried out† ecological thinning last year to create a ""mosaic of natural features""ù with the aim of cultivating better forest health and improving resiliency against pests, drought and wildfires.†† ""The thinning was conducted in a variable density fashion to produce heterogeneity across the landscape, [with] these clumps and open patches leading to [an] overall increase in biodiversity,""ù Grupenhoff said.†† ""But a big question is, how do we know if these treatments are effective without a massive wildfire? One way we can do this is through simulating fire through time under multiple scenarios, climate and management treatments.""ù† These forest vegetation simulators have been employed to help researchers better understand how the structure of a forest changes in response to fire. The simulators also take climate change into account by looking at how mortality is affected by projected warming. So what have the researchers found from these simulations?† ""Thinning is great at reducing tree density but results in an increase in service fuels. So reintroducing fire is important to restoring forest health. It keeps our flammable fuels in check, protects larger trees [and] maintains structural diversity. And there's hope that in Valentine, controlled burning operations could start next year, which is really exciting,""ù Grupenhoff said. And this information is important for more than ecologists. As seen especially poignantly in 2018 and 2020, with the Camp Fire and the North Complex Fire, respectively, a community in an overgrown, unhealthy forest is a community at risk.† ""Fuel reduction and forest restoration is not just something we want to do, or should. We almost kind of have to do it ""¶ It's a miracle at this point that you have not had a really severe fire or loss of life [in Mammoth]. It's going to happen,""ù Safford said.

science,NASA and ESA Partner up to Launch an Oceanography Satellite from Santa Barbara County Designed to Monitor Rising Sea Levels,7-Dec-20,9:00 AM,['Brian Patton'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-07/nasa-and-esa-partner-up-to-launch-an-oceanography-satellite-from-santa-barbara-county-designed-to-monitor-rising-sea-levels/,"Scientists in the US and Europe have come together in order to monitor and counteract the problem of rising sea levels. The global mean sea level has risen between 8-9 inches since 1880. A third of this rise in sea level has occurred over the past 25 years. Scientists from the US-based space exploration agency the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) collaborated with the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop an Earth-imaging satellite with new technology designed to monitor the rising sea level.† A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 2016. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base carrying the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich on Saturday, Nov. 21 at 9:17 a.m. PST, just 55.8 miles from the University of California, Santa Barbara campus, from which the rocket could be seen in flight.† ""ùThe Falcon 9 is the first orbital class reusable rocket capable of reflight,""ù according to SpaceX.† This is Falcon 9's 99th mission, which successfully launched the oceanography satellite into orbit and then landed back in Santa Barbara within less than nine minutes. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich earth imaging satellite can monitor the global sea level with millimeter precision. It is the latest edition of the European-based Copernicus Programme and will work together with existing satellites already under the program. The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich is the beginning of the sixth family of satellites under Copernicus which is designated to monitor global sea levels.† According to Guido Levrini, Copernicus Space Segment Programme Manager at ESA, ""[Each] Sentinel has a specific duty. Sentinel-1 is more specifically tailored to emergency response, Sentinel-2 is focused on monitoring the land, Sentinel-3 together with Sentinel-6 is focused on monitoring the ocean and waters, Sentinel-4 together with Sentinel-5 is specially tailored for monitoring the atmosphere.""ù Sentinel-6B, the twin of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (Sentinel-6A), is scheduled for launch in 2025. Technology on board Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich is the most advanced satellite dedicated to earth imaging to date. It is solar-powered and processes the data using its onboard data system, a central processor and mass memory software. Like the technology on board Jason-2 and Jason-3, Sentinel-6 will incorporate Advanced Microwave Radiometer (AMR) technology, which is used to measure the amount of water vapor between the satellite and the ocean with the new Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMR-C).† The AMR-C, developed by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), improves upon the AMR through its incorporation of an onboard calibration system. Ordinarily, AMR's radar altimeter can make the ocean appear higher or lower than it actually is. The new calibration system is intended to improve on the stability of radar delay measurements from year to year, ""ensuring the altimeter system is capable of tracking changes in the global mean sea level extremely accurately,""ù according to a press kit from JPL.† ""The AMR-C instrument also includes an experimental High-Resolution Microwave Radiometer (HRMR) that will provide the radar delay measurements to a higher resolution, therefore allowing radar delay measurements along coastal areas, which is not currently possible with other missions,""ù according to the press kit.† The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich will be controlled by the ESA, under the Copernicus Programme from their ESOC Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Earth imaging data collected by the program is distributed for public use free of charge.† A screenshot of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich viewed on ""Eyes on the Earth.""ù Courtesy of NASA's Eyes. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich is named after former Director of the NASA Earth Science Division Michael Freilich, who passed away on August 5, 2020 at the age of 66 due to pancreatic cancer. As a young man, Michael Freilich was a talented nature photographer and he dedicated his entire life to earth sciences.† While serving as NASA's director of the Earth Science Division, Freilich ""revitalized the fleet of Earth-observing satellites""¶ he received, among other honors, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, NASA's Distinguished Achievement Award and Public Service Medal, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Director's Research Achievement Award,""ù according to Freilich's obituary published in the Philadelphia Inquirer.† According to a press release from JPL, ""this latest mission marks the first international involvement in Copernicus, the European Union's Earth Observation Programme""ù The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich will begin transmitting oceanography data within three months, following a series of tests and calibrations which are already underway, according to JPL's press release.† †""The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich oceanography satellite is currently processing a series of tests and calibrations where it will begin transmitting science data within 3 months.""ù The satellite will enhance weather forecasts and provide new data on coastal sea levels and sea currents, extending a 30-year continuous dataset shared by the US and Europe. The onboard AMR-C equipped with the experimental HRMR makes this satellite the Earth's most accurate sea level monitoring satellite. It will use its millimeter precision to scan 95% of Earth's sea level surface within 10 days of collecting data, from 800 miles above Earth. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich can be watched in real time on NASA's Eyes.

science,UCSB Researchers Find Significant Gaps in Widely Used Fisheries Datasets,7-Dec-20,10:30 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-07/ucsb-researchers-find-significant-gaps-in-widely-used-fisheries-datasets/,"The health of fishery stocks is of paramount importance to food security across the world. Billions of people rely on wild-caught and farmed seafood to provide their main source of protein. Unfortunately, fish stocks in recent years have found themselves in precarious positions following years of overexploitation. Freshly fished Larimichthys polyactis, or small yellow croaker, stored in plastic tubs and covered in ice. Courtesy of Cody Szuwalski As policymakers in the present day must contend with the overlapping effects of overfishing, pollution and rapid climate change, obtaining an understanding of the health of the global ocean is becoming more and more crucial.† Unfortunately, there is still quite a bit we do not know about all the fish in the sea.† In order to better understand holes in the global community's understanding of fisheries in particular, Gordon Blasco, a researcher at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UCSB, working in collaboration with other researchers at UCSB, looked at discrepancies between three commonly used datasets. ""The issue that we're highlighting is that there are gaps in the knowledge base. And while those gaps exist, it limits what researchers can say. What we really wanted to do is just show what those gaps look like,""ù Blasco said.† These datasets, namely the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) global fisheries production database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, use different metrics to evaluate harvested aquatic animals. The FAO global fisheries production database provides information on which types of aquatic animals are harvested for commercial use, mainly seafood. Meanwhile, RAM assessments tend to focus on intensely harvested fish stocks which carry high economic value, like tuna, salmon and cod, according to Blasco.† ""The point of RAM is to get these reference points out to say, ""òWe can harvest sustainably this amount of biomass, of this specific species in this specific area without making the stock decline over time.' So it's about getting the sustainable yield,""ù Blasco said.† In contrast, the IUCN Red List's focus is on conservation status assessments, classifying species from ""òleast concern,' to ""òcritically endangered' and even ""òextinct.' In comprehensive IUCN assessments, there is also research done into the threats a particular species faces. Some species are threatened by bycatch, for instance.† ""There's a lot more information than just how is the stock doing,""ù Blasco said.† ""We took all the species in [the FAO database] and just said, ""òWhich of those species are in RAM, and which are in IUCN?""ù The researchers found that out of 1,695 consumed aquatic species or groups recorded in FAO's database, more than a third were missing from both the IUCN and RAM's databases. Meanwhile, less than 10% of the aquatic taxa in FAO's database had stock and conservation assessments in both RAM and the IUCN. This relative lack of information was concentrated both taxonomically and geographically; with invertebrates and landings in Asia both lacking in species-specific information.† While it isn't a given that aquatic animals missing from RAM or the IUCN Red List are more threatened than other animals, these omissions are a challenge to researchers and policymakers ""î the lack of information muddies one's understanding of how these taxa are doing, making it more difficult to make effective policy decisions or draw conclusions which actually reflect reality.† ""It's hard to say what the implications for this are, but the fact that knowledge about these species are not in these primary datasets is troubling. That doesn't necessarily mean these are overexploited, it just means people using these large datasets don't have a way to say anything about these [taxa].""ù And all of this means that our understanding of the ocean itself is hazier for not having the full picture.†† ""It is a quantification of the unknown, but there is a very big debate in fisheries literature about the global state of the ocean and how well certain management practices have been doing and what that means,""ù Blasco said.† †""We're kind of cutting through that, in a way, and just saying, ""òLook, there's not much you can say about the global ocean, because so many species are left out of the datasets you guys are using.' I think there's some value there.""ù† Blasco's hope is that research like this will shine a spotlight on the work that those working with the FAO, RAM and the IUCN still have ahead of them. ""One thing is that we really don't want this paper to seem like it's bashing on any datasets. The work that all these people do is amazing and they are like the heroes of this story. All the scientists and policymakers that make these datasets possible are heroes,""ù Blasco said.† ""Who this paper is designed for are policymakers and people who fund these datasets. Those are the people that I want to read this paper. I want them to be motivated to continue supporting the IUCN, FAO and RAM.""ù Comments are closed.

science,Dating To a Science: UCSB Researchers Study Patterns in Assortative Mating,20-Dec-20,8:00 PM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-20/model-romance-ucsb-researchers-study-patterns-in-assortative-mating/,"Often, romance and mating are relegated to the frivolities of life, but according to Daniel Conroy-Beam, an assistant professor and evolutionary psychologist in the Psychological & Brain Sciences Department at UC Santa Barbara, as biological organisms that are the product of evolution, there is little more impactful on the outcome of humans than who we mate with and why we do.† Assortative mating is a mating pattern in which individuals select mates that are similar to themselves.†Courtesy of Pixabay Conroy-Beam and fellow professor and evolutionary psychologist James Roney received the Margo Wilson Award for Best Paper in Evolution and Human Behavior earlier in the year for their study in assortative mating and the coevolution of desirable traits.† Assortative mating, as defined by Conroy-Beam, is a mating pattern in which individuals select mates that are similar to themselves. Conroy-Beam's interest as an evolutionary psychologist lies in using matrix algorithms to create computational models of mate choice, then comparing those models with data of real-life mate choices that people have made. While doing these matrix models, he saw a correlation between specific traits, despite the traits being assorted randomly throughout individuals in the simulation.† ""It was an act of serendipity, really,""ù Conroy-Beam said. ""Assortative mating and trait coevolution was a verbal idea, but there it was in a computer simulation. Then, we compared it to real data that came out of similar mating events, and we saw similar patterns of correlations.""ù Subsequently, Conroy-Beam and his fellow researchers at the UCSB Computational Mate Choice Lab created more models of mating markets with evolutionary agents with their own unique traits and preferences. In this series of computer experiments, they manipulated the features of the models to see what conditions led to a presence or a lack of correlation between traits. This data was compared and contrasted with a large cross-cultural sample of individuals from 45 countries all over the world. Participants in the cross-cultural sample reported their ideal partner's standing on five different traits: health, physical attractiveness, intelligence, kindness and financial standing. They then ranked their own standing on those same five traits.† ""The phenomenon that we observed in the computational models was something we saw in the real-life data we collected as well,""ù Conroy-Beam said. ""If you look across all the domains of what people like and consider in a partner, these traits are distributed randomly.""ù This means that the funniest person will not necessarily be the most intelligent person, or the most physically attractive person the kindest.† ""So there's a bit of a balancing act,""ù Conroy-Beam said. ""You have to decide how you get the most of everything, even if no one is exactly perfect.""ù† To a degree, the different dimensions of a person ""î their personality, their appearance, their financial prospects ""î is random. But Conroy-Beam's study found small, yet significant correlations where if a person is desirable in one dimension, they tend to be slightly more desirable in other dimensions as well.† ""It's a phenomenon that had sort of been predicted, but one that no one observed directly,""ù Conroy-Beam said. ""People tend to want kind partners and intelligent partners, so the most desirable people in the mating market are going to be the people who are both kind and intelligent.""ù† Subsequently, Conroy-Beam said, when two romantic partners mate as they do, they may have children who are disproportionately likely to inherit genes that contribute both to their kindness and intelligence.† ""If these two types of trends are desired in the population, they'll tend to become correlated with the population as well, to the degree that people may assort directly from those dimensions,""ù Conroy-Beam said.† According to Conroy-Beam, correlations such as these stretch across a number of dimensions, creating a positive manifold observable in computer simulations and in real life.† ""These are small correlations ""î things you probably wouldn't even notice in everyday life,""ù Conroy-Beam said. ""But the actual size of the correlations isn't important, the fact that they exist provides meaning to who we are as a species.""ù† The act of mating and reproduction is very close to the engine of human evolution. This study, Conroy-Beam emphasized, provides a window into why we choose the people we do and how it relates to what it means to be human.

The lab allows for coordination of patient sample acquisition of tests, testing logistics, case management and contact tracing efforts.† Dr. Jose Carlos Ponce Rojas, a postdoctoral scholar in MCDB, working with samples under a fume hood. Courtesy of Stuart Feinstein The COVID-19 Response Team includes faculty, administrators and staff on campus. Among the most notable is Professor Carolina Arias, who initiated the on-campus COVID-19 laboratory and has been instrumental in all aspects of its development, according to Stuart Feinstein, another leader in the initiation and integration of the laboratory who joined Sept. 1.†† Santa Barbara County has reached the purple tier of lockdown procedures, indicating that COVID-19 is widespread in the county. Indeed, the average number of COVID-19 cases per day has reached 353 as of Jan. 6, according to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department.† According to Feinstein, the biggest part of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is time. ""Too much time between testing and results can significantly compromise efforts to minimize viral spread,""ù Feinstein said.† Because the lab is accredited according to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), an especially high standard of rigor and oversights is required for the lab ""î a standard that Feinstein says is necessary to conduct diagnostic clinical testing. ""UC Santa Barbara personnel can process nearly a thousand samples a day and have most of the results available the same day or the following morning,""ù Feinstein said. ""Our lab contributes greatly to our efforts to mitigate COVID-19 on campus and is therefore a very important component of our overall effort to re-open the campus for all of us.""ù As part of the CLIA certification, laboratories must adhere to the standards set forth by the Center for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration, and the Center for Medicaid Services.† The lab facilitates asymptomatic testing ""î up to 5,000 tests per week ""î for all UCSB students in the area as well as UCSB staff and faculty who provide essential services on campus. According to Feinstein, the ability to quickly identify cases allows the campus to swiftly address outbreaks and better mitigate the viral spread on campus and in the greater Santa Barbara community.† Feinstein said that a CLIA-accredited lab requires routine maintenance and procedural adjustments to stay operational. According to the CDC, CLIA has strict regulations regarding the use of human specimens for health assessments or diagnoses. In addition, those involved in the diagnostic laboratory will have to continuously look out for supply chain issues to increase efficiency, as well as adapt to frequent advancements in medical knowledge about COVID-19. For instance, the new variant of the COVID-19 virus found in the U.K. has raised awareness of the ability of COVID-19 tests to detect the virus diagnostically. Feinstein said that those at the lab have determined that neither of the current tests being used are affected by the viral sequence changes in the recent variant. Still, Feinstein said that the next steps for the lab include increasing its capacity to conduct additional independent COVID-19 tests in the event that future viral sequence changes do impact the accuracy of current tests.† According to Feinstein, the establishment of the lab wouldn't be possible without collaborations between the response team and clinical units in and beyond Santa Barbara, such as with UCSB Student Health Services, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and laboratories at UC Los Angeles. The new lab is an extension of the CLIA-accredited laboratory belonging to Student Health Services that conducts clinical tests for other pathogens. With the additional assistance of pathologists from Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and amidst delay due to supply chain problems, the COVID-19 Response Team was able to establish the COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory in the BioEngineering building on campus in less than 5 months.† Feinstein emphasized that it is collaborations like these that have contributed to the success of the lab, as UCSB is a non-medical research institution. ""This entire project required enormous contributions from so many people on campus, including the chancellor, vice chancellors, deans, Student Health, Student Affairs, Budget and Planning, Public Affairs and Communication, Housing, the MCDB department, Information Technology, Legal Counsel, Human Resources, chemistry stores, the Physics Machine Shop and many, many others,""ù Feinstein said.† ""This has been a ton of work by a whole lot of people, and there have been ups and downs ""î but so far, at least, I think we are getting the job done.""ù

The testing unit is currently hosted by and located at CenCal Health at 4050 Calle Real and is open today 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., and 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. from tomorrow onwards. The unit is expected to remain at the location for two weeks, until it is moved to a new location.† The new location of the mobile unit after its duration at CenCal Health has yet to be announced. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus The setup of a mobile testing site, as opposed to the existing static testing sites located at the Santa Maria Health Care Center and Isla Vista Theater, allows for officials to move testing sites to particularly impacted areas of the county. Because the location of the testing site isn't stationary, greater coverage is provided by the unit, as it can be moved based on the current distribution of COVID-19 cases at the time. Santa Barbara has remained in the purple tier since Dec. 6, according to the Santa Barbara Public Health Department (SBPHD). Cases of COVID-19 in the county have been increasing by a seven-day average of 445 per day. According to the Santa Barbara County Community Dashboard, COVID-19 has disparately impacted the Hispanic and Latino population in the county. While the Hispanic and Latino populations account for 48% of the county's population, they represent 65% of total COVID-19 cases, 74% of COVID-19 hospitalizations and 56% of COVID-19 deaths, as of September 30.† Similar mobile testing units meant specifically to expand testing in areas of high-risk populations, such as communities with large Black and Latino populations, have seen success in Los Angeles County. Cases among these demographics nearly doubled in the month of December. The mobile testing units allowed officials to test nearly 1,000 people a day, an increase critical to mitigating the spread of COVID-19.† While its current location is not situated in one of these areas where underserved communities are predominantly affected, according to geographic data provided by SBPHD, the mobile testing unit does have the potential to attenuate the effect of COVID-19 on similar populations in our own county in areas like Lompoc and Santa Maria. The new location of the mobile unit after its duration at CenCal Health has yet to be announced. Updates on the mobile unit can be found on the SBPHD's website.

The presence of a dog versus a wolf marks a significant paradigm shift and it will change how you think about the site you're working in.† An assortment of skulls, including domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, a jackal, a dingo, several species of fox and a hyena. Courtesy of Martin Welker and Susan Hamilton So you think on it. You see that there are a number of methods used to identify canines in the archaeological record. Which one should you choose though, and why?† This is a question that Sarah McClure, a professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Anthropology, and her collaborators at the University of Arizona and Utah State University have been grappling with. Their research, published in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, examined various methods used to identify dogs and other canines in the archaeological record.† The project began when McClure was working alongside a doctoral student, Martin Welker, at Penn State University.† Most methods used to identify dog bones in the archaeological record are predicated on the assumption that the archaeologists are specifically differentiating dogs from the grey wolf, the common ancestor of all dogs and ""î particularly before modern times ""î widespread all across the Northern Hemisphere.† However, during his studies in North America examining animal bone assemblages, Welker observed a number of canid species found alongside dogs elsewhere around the world complicated and perhaps lowered the effectiveness of such methods.† Think of coyotes living in California. How ought the means to differentiate coyotes and dogs differ from those used to differentiate dogs from wolves?† ""How do these methods actually play out in a situation where you have a lot more diversity in the general family of dogs?""ù McClure said. ""That's how this project started, with the idea that we could use the techniques that other people had been using and apply them to known collections in museums and research collections of known animals, and then evaluate which ones work best for what kind of canine.""ù In order to identify animal remains, archaeologists often make use of known bone measurements to differentiate different specimens which would otherwise share a nearly indistinguishable bone structure. These include traits like the relative size of teeth and the curvature of the mandible, or jawbone.† ""We use these measurements that have been standardized since the 1970s because they're the most common ones that archaeologists themselves use. We wanted to be able to test the methods that people had created sort of emerging from these measurements,""ù McClure said.† ""So everybody knows these measurements. They can be easily recreated and replicated. And so we just went through and started testing them to see whether statistical analyses would be able to place these known specimens into the proper species.""ù† Four methods were tested using the remains of domestic dogs, grey wolves, coyotes and various types of foxes. These analyses compared tooth crowding, which is a measure of the disharmony between the size of the teeth and jaw, the length of the first molar, mandibular bowing, which is a measurement index of the manner in which the mandibles bow, or bend, and finally a general principle statistical analysis, which took all of the data the researchers had and stuck these into a statistical analysis. ""Unfortunately what we found was that there's no silver bullet, there's no one method, that is answer master. What we found is that it depends on what the question is,""ù McClure said.† ""So if your question is: ""òIs this a wolf or is this a domestic dog?,' you should either look at this first mandible length or you should use this principal component analysis that we did.""ù† Conversely, according to McClure, if one is working in the Western U.S., and they're trying to distinguish a domestic dog from a coyote, looking at the bow of the mandible is a better bet. ""Essentially, you know, we tried to create a toolkit for archaeologists, where depending on where they're working in North America or Europe they can use different methods to distinguish what they've found,""ù McClure said.

science,Cancer and Chemo From a Wider Lens,17-Jan-21,11:50 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-17/cancer-and-chemo-from-a-wider-lens/,"Only trailing after cardiovascular diseases in the United States ""î and now competing with coronavirus ""î cancer is a leading cause of death throughout the developed world, and results in much loss, grief and suffering.† Given this, a fortune has been devoted to cancer research, cancer therapies, treatments and prevention. In 2018, national expenditures for cancer care in the United States alone numbered 150.8 billion dollars, and, with a rapidly aging population, cancer rates can only be expected to rise ""î and cancer costs with it.†† In stark contrast to humans, who only have one, elephants have 20 copies of p53, a tumor-fighting gene. Courtesy of Amy Boddy However, as is the case for many subjects in the life sciences, important questions surrounding the complicated and multifaceted condition continue to pile on and remain unanswered. Worse yet, cancer research is often focused on cancer from a biomedical perspective, leaving the ecology and evolution of cancer relatively understudied in academia. But there are rumblings of new developments. The times they are a-changin. Researchers across various disciplines have warmed to the idea of cancer research from broader perspectives, with many across various fields collaborating with the aim of extending the research reach of cancer into new, exciting disciplines and inviting needed perspectives.† Amy Boddy, a professor in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Anthropology, in collaboration with over 30 researchers from across the world, has been working to identify future trajectories of research into cancer along this lens, with the hopes of steering cancer research from a foundation rooted in cross-disciplinary collaboration and an eco-evolutionary framework.†† Around February of last year, Boddy began to advance some of her own questions and edit inquiries from others during the collaborative process. In total, 84 research questions from 33 experts were published, organized around nine major themes. Specifically, Boddy had questions related to the evolution of cancer-prevention mechanisms across various species and the evolution of tumors ""î as well as lifestyle and social modifications used to prevent and treat cancer in humans. ""My particular questions really revolved around organismal evolution. Basically how other species solve the problem of cancer. I think evolution can provide a lot of insight for us,""ù Boddy said.† In addition, Boddy's interests extend to the tumor itself and how the ecology of the tumor, tumor growth and evolution can be predicted using the same principles ecologists and evolutionary biologists use to understand organismal evolution and life history.† ""Why a mouse becomes a mouse versus an elephant becomes an elephant. Why development is fast or slow. I'm interested in whether we can use these principles of life history theory to understand and predict tumor evolution as well,""ù Boddy said.† It was only as recent as 2013 that Boddy, whose specialty is evolutionary medicine, began studying cancer biology. The field was experiencing one of its first initial surges in growth and interest. Having previously studied evolutionary principles and taken a comparative approach to studying other diseases, looking at phenotype with regards to disease and comparing various types of animals, Boddy expected there to have already been a body of research looking into cancer from a similar vantage point.† But such a body of research was nowhere to be found.† ""I was quite surprised when I started studying underlying the evolutionary principles of cancer biology that we don't know much about other organisms and their cancer rates,""ù Boddy said.† Boddy began studying comparative oncology hoping to understand why some species are better equipped to weather cancer than others, such as naked mole rats and long-lived species like elephants. What cancer-suppressor mechanisms exist across the animal kingdom? What genetic toolkits have evolved over history with the aim of defending against cancer? Boddy and her colleagues are itching to better understand these things.† Among these were people like Carlo Maley, a co-author of this publication and a researcher with the Arizona Cancer Evolution Center at Arizona State University. Maley participated in research which uncovered the duplication of TP53 in elephants, a gene which fights cancer cells.† From a more anthropological perspective, Boddy also fielded questions pertaining to patients' own perspectives regarding cancer and how to shift the mindset around cancer in modern society, particularly with the advancement of cancer treatments like adaptive therapy.† ""[In adaptive therapy,] you're basically using evolution and ecology principles to steer the evolution of the tumor ""¶ What adaptive therapy does is actually measure tumor burden, and then give chemotherapy drugs ""¶ based on the tumor burden, with the goal of not removing the tumor cells, but just knocking them back,""ù Boddy said.† Unlike in standard cancer treatment, the goals of adaptive therapy ""î rooted in evolutionary theory ""î dictate that patients and practitioners give lower doses of drugs to prevent creating resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Such practices using the adaptive map work well in mouse models and have been carried out in clinical trials for humans with prostate cancer and breast cancer.† ""This challenges our perception on understanding cancer. Many of the terms around treatment and tackling cancer are very much like ""òwar on cancer, we've got to combat it, we have to fight it,' things like that. And that can be very problematic when suddenly we're dealing with a paradigm shift and saying you can actually live with this disease,""ù Boddy said.† In fact, understanding the patient's perspective and bringing in more cross-disciplinary research in cancer is key, according to Boddy and her collaborators.† ""This perception of the patient side of it I think is really important, and that really comes from having some people in this cross disciplinary research team in the humanities. So, kind of having this perspective on how people will perceive this change is also key,""ù Boddy said.† ""Some people in the EEMB perspective might just think about the ecology and evolution of tumor drivers and all of that, but we always have to bring it back to human patients if that's what we're really interested in solving.""ù†

science,Santa Barbara County Hopeful for Accelerated Vaccine Distribution in Coming Weeks,30-Jan-21,11:45 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-30/santa-barbara-country-continues-to-struggle-in-vaccine-distribution-expects-change-in-coming-weeks/,"Yesterday, California Senator Monique Lim√≥n, U.S. Representative Salud Carbajal and California Assembly Member Steve Bennett hosted a town hall over Zoom regarding the status of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Santa Barbara County. Joined by them were Dr. Van Do-Reynoso, the Santa Barbara County Public Health director, and Barry L. Zimmerman, the Ventura Healthcare Agency chief deputy director, who spoke on the vaccines themselves and phases of distribution across both Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. A vial containing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, one of two vaccines being offered in Santa Barbara County, alongside Moderna's. Courtesy of the Department of Defense The statewide vaccine distribution program, which began in late-December, has administered 3.2 million vaccine doses so far. According to Do-Reynoso, Santa Barbara county is currently facing a shortfall of vaccine doses from the federal government, especially relative to the distribution infrastructure in the county. As of Thursday, Santa Barbara had so far only received 44,825 vaccine doses since the start of vaccine distribution, according to Do-Reynoso. Of those vaccines, about 33,000 had already been administered. Next week the county is expecting to receive only 6,550 doses. ""So, we continue to receive very, very limited amounts of vaccine,""ù Do-Reynoso said. 80% of the vaccine doses have been allocated to hospitals, community clinics, medical providers and pharmacies, while the remaining 20% have been sent to community vaccination sites in Santa Maria, Lompoc and Santa Barbara. ""The outgoing administration made some statements of the availability of vaccines. As this new administration came in and they found that there wasn't the quantity of vaccines available that was promised to states,""ù Carbajal said. ""And now it's rippling down to our local communities of these challenges of having availability of vaccines.""ù Because of the short supply, the county has prioritized vaccine doses for those that are particularly high-risk, even relative to standards in other California counties. Currently, both Santa Barbara and Ventura county are offering vaccines to those 75 years old and above, as well as healthcare workers with direct patient contact. ""We understand that [among] other counties throughout California, some are using the 65-plus criteria,""ù Do-Reynoso said. ""It is frustrating to see other counties offering that, but because of our limited number of vaccines, and because of the data we have regarding who's vulnerable in our community to becoming very sick and suffering severe outcomes ""¶ we ""¶ [made] the decision to focus on the most vulnerable segments of our community.""ù But there have been new developments. The manner of vaccine distribution ""î and the delegation of responsibilities to public health departments ""î is undergoing significant changes. By mid-February, a new standardized vaccine distribution standard will be implemented statewide, with vaccines distributed by Blue Shield, a health plan provider which will function as a third party distributor, according to Do-Reynoso. According to Do-Reynoso, Blue Shield will be tasked with cooperating with ""pharmacies, large health clinics, hospitals and community health centers to cover the main population.""ù Meanwhile, county-level public health departments will shift focus, reaching out to vulnerable populations, such as houseless people, the mentally ill, those with substance abuse disorder, undocumented peoples and other ""hard to reach populations.""ù ""So we will continue to function as the safety net provider, while the vaccines will be distributed and allocated by Blue Shield,""ù Do-Reynoso said. Such an approach runs in stark contrast to California's existing county-based approach, which has dragged California to near the bottom-tier of states in per-capita coronavirus vaccination rates. Alongside this, a new COVID-19 vaccination notification software system intended to accelerate vaccine distribution, MyTurn, will begin operating statewide during mid-February. Already being piloted in San Diego and Los Angeles, MyTurn will allow members of the community to self-screen to determine their eligibility for vaccination and locate vaccination sites. Providers will also be able to use the platform to record vaccinations, enroll community members at clinics and collect data more seamlessly, according to Do-Reynoso. A few voiced confusion regarding the 75-and-over age threshold needed for most community members to obtain vaccines in the county, which Do-Reynoso and Zimmerman acknowledged as undesirable but unavoidable. ""Essentially, we will vaccinate the 65 and above when the state sends us more vaccines. We are ready, our infrastructure is ready,""ù Do-Reynoso said. Zimmerman added that in areas offering vaccines to those 65 and over, such as Los Angeles County, the likelihood is that those counties are actually still unable to service the entire 65 and over population, causing those at the highest risk to have limited access in the scramble to get vaccinated. ""So we felt that was not a good thing to do at this moment. We need to be sure that we're going to be able to adequately service the population,""ù Zimmerman said. In addition, Zimmerman and Do-Reynoso mentioned that, looking forward, the two counties have begun planning for outreach to ensure that vulnerable populations such as farmworkers are able to access the vaccine once they become eligible. According to Lim√≥n, eastern Santa Barbara county has one of the highest levels of infection in California. It also has a large population of vulnerable communities, including Latino populations, farmworkers and those in congregate living settings. In Ventura County, the agriculture industry has signaled a desire to carry out vaccination programs in coordination with the county, according to Zimmerman. ""They've offered locations for mass vaccination centers and those types of things on their own site, which we will take advantage of,""ù Zimmerman said. Carbajal and Do-Reynoso are also hopeful that the Biden administration will help to accelerate vaccine distribution. ""Hope springs eternal. I am very hopeful that with the new federal leadership that there will be a pipeline of increased vaccines to California, and then to Santa Barbara County,""ù Do-Reynoso said. ""But that's also the same timeframe that the state will shift to the new framework as well ""¶ So with increased vaccines, and the standardization of the tier system ""¶ I anticipate lots of changes within, I'd say, a three to four week timeframe.""ù Comments are closed.

science,Here Comes the Sun: UCSB Researchers Uncover Link Between UV Radiation and COVID-19 Transmission,31-Jan-21,10:50 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-31/here-comes-the-sun-ucsb-researchers-uncover-link-between-uv-radiation-and-covid-19-transmission/,"While the novel coronavirus ran its first lap around the Earth in early 2020, making history, researchers worked hurriedly to understand the nature of the disease and the best means to restrict its spread in the face of uncertainty, with world governments in shock and the global economy in freefall. Other human coronaviruses exhibit some seasonality in their rates of spread. Courtesy of Tamma Carleton Researchers from UCSB, Tamma Carleton and Kyle C. Meng, along with collaborators at Harvard and ENS Paris-Saclay, scrambled to collect regional data and run analyses to better understand the role that climate may have on the spread of COVID-19. Their study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, uncovers one dimension of this: climatic variation in the intensity of UV† radiation, or sunlight, and corresponding effects on COVID-19 transmission. Having previously studied the effects of climate change on social and economic outcomes, such as mental health, civil conflict and agricultural output, Carleton and her collaborators made use of a toolkit they developed prior to answer such questions as they pertained to COVID-19 transmission rates across various regions during the beginning of the pandemic. Close relatives of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as other human coronaviruses, exhibit a marked seasonality in their rates of spread in temperate regions, with a global peak occurring during the winter season. ""We're like, ""òWell, everyone really wants to know how seasonal this is, because we're all trying to project into the summer and into the winter, what this might look like,""ù Carleton said. ""And, you know, we've built up this toolkit to link changes in the weather with different social and economic outcomes. Why don't we bring our tool kit to this problem?'""ù This toolkit, reliant on a supply of observational data to link weather and social and economic outcomes, previously looked at climate variation across different time spans within the same region to tease out how weather affects a population of people. For instance, Carleton had previously looked at data within single locations in sub-Saharan Africa during drier or hotter growing seasons relative to the average and used this to ascertain how a shift away from normal conditions in turn impacts mortality rates, conflict or productivity, among a range of other issues. Understanding these impacts is particularly crucial as climate change accelerates. With this particular research, Carleton and her collaborators pivoted, using data to isolate and statistically identify the role that individual climate conditions may have in contributing to the spread of COVID-19. She and her collaborators began a concerted search for information from various countries' statistical agencies across the world. The researchers collected data across over 3000 different geospatial units, or locations; this data contained a treasure trove of information: real-time weather estimates, temperature, humidity, precipitation, ultraviolet radiation and most crucially, COVID-19 cases. ""As you might imagine, in the United States, weather conditions in Santa Barbara look very different than they do in Minneapolis, Minnesota. And so, to ensure that we could capture differences within a country as opposed to just across countries, we needed a really big data collection effort to collect as much as we could within countries,""ù Carleton said. ""Essentially you're estimating using a big statistical model linking those changes and COVID-19 cases to change in weather conditions.""ù The researchers discovered a significant connection between negative correlation between UV radiation and COVID-19 growth rates, though the strength of the relationship was not quite as strong as others have proven to be, such as social distancing policies. Other measures the researchers looked at, like humidity and temperature, yielded no relationship. ""A sunnier day is going to lower transmission that can happen through multiple different channels and all those channels are going to be accounted for here. So, one is just that we know that UV breaks down the virus. But we also know that there's all sorts of human behaviors that change. We all do different things on sunny or on hotter days than we do on other days,""ù Carleton said. However, Carleton also stressed possible issues with the data they're drawing from, which may be clouding important relationships between COVID-19 spread and with other weather conditions. ""The world is scrambling to improve testing and reporting. Meanwhile, we are stuck running analyses on the data that we have. And in many cases, the data that we have here is imperfect, although we go to really great lengths to try to adjust them for really obvious inconsistencies,""ù Carleton said. Because of this, Carleton speculates that temperature and humidity may still possibly have a significant effect on COVID-19 growth. Perhaps, as Carleton said, rather than being the only driver, UV is the strongest driver of those that the researchers measured. ""I think the other thing to be aware of this in this paper is that like I said, we really rushed to try to answer this question during the beginning of the pandemic so the data behind these estimates are early pandemic estimates,""ù Carleton said. ""And so to the extent that the disease changes over time ""î we've been hearing about new variants, for example, social distancing policies are different, which may influence the relationship between weather and COVID-19 ""î we should really be thinking about these estimates as early pandemic estimates.""ù

science,The Blue Collar Iron Man: A Look At Workplace Exoskeletons,31-Jan-21,11:30 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-31/the-blue-collar-iron-man-ucsb-researchers-look-at-the-implications-of-workplace-exoskeletons/,"In 2010, Raytheon, a major U.S. defense contractor, unveiled the XOS 2, a robotic exoskeleton which imbued wearers with the power to effortlessly lift hundreds of pounds. Designed to be used by the military, the development of XOS 2 drew significant media attention and was even dubbed by Time Magazine as one of the 50 best inventions of the year.  Now, fast-forward 10 years later, and one observes interest coming from firms outside of the military as well. How is this relevant to workers themselves during the burgeoning age of blue-collar exoskeletons? ""All of a sudden we see that those capabilities are also valuable in traditional blue collar work. So, traditional jobs where, you know, how fast you are or how strong you are really dictates your job performance and how well you succeed ""¶ These exoskeletons are being developed by the private sector for those types of jobs,""ù Gavin Kirkwood, a researcher in UCSB's Department of Communication, said. As private companies and blue collar workers grapple with a future marked by the entrance of exoskeletons ""î potentially alleviating the demands of physical labor in many occupations ""î researchers at UCSB are trying to understand what that means for workers, and what might make workers more open to a change of such magnitude in their own workplace. Because, after all, how does the nature of work change when one's own nature may have to change to accommodate a machine? And going beyond that, how do people change what they think of themselves and their work when they're doing their heavy lifting surrounded by a metal shell? ""We know that when it comes to technology adoption in organizations is that people are really sensitive to types of technologies that change how they identify with their work ""¶ or the type of job satisfaction that they get,""ù Kirkwood said. ""So you can see how in these traditional blue collar industries, the adoption of exoskeletons is really changing the way things work, and even changing what types of workers you would want in this position.""ù Kirkwood, Christopher Otmar and Mohemmad Hansia, brought interpersonal adaptation theory (IAT) to breach such questions from the academic lens and hopefully shed some light on how work will evolve as humans find themselves in the company of coworkers made of metal and wires, rather than just flesh and bones. IAT is an assortment of various theories and frameworks intended to understand social interactions. In particular, the researchers brought forth aspects of IAT dealing with nonverbal communication in order to understand how humans and exoskeletons may achieve greater synchrony in movement, as well as what preferences humans themselves may have with regards to the nature of coordinated movement. In order to inform their work using IAT, Kirkwood and his collaborators have been using data from research focusing on a confidential proprietary exoskeleton at Virginia Tech. ""We've been analyzing interviews of people who are using an early model of the suit. And it's interesting to see the type of people that want the suit to just automatically move with them, and that makes them feel like they're in more control over what they're doing, versus the people who liked to feel like they actually have more control in terms of initiating movements,""ù Kirkwood said. But there are also other issues bubbling up alongside the question of whether to embrace a more natural and unconscious synchrony versus one that is more conscious and deliberate, some of which are challenges to even the mere adoption of exoskeleton technology. Most obviously, there are practical constraints imposed on those who use exoskeletons, and there is a degree of functionality that must be achieved to make it worth using them. Humans in exoskeletons, for instance, tend to be clumsier than those outside of them, at least in the present moment. There are also psychological quandaries which serve as obstacles to widespread adoption, according to Kirkwood. ""So when we're thinking about strategic synchrony it's like, ""òIs something like fear of technology, going to keep workers from wanting to synchronize with the machine, or using it as it was designed?',""ù Kirkwood said. ""So it kind of boils down to like the wearer's perception, how they're thinking about the machine, and what they desire when they're using the machine.""ù But one can even go further than that, Kirkwood argued, because in addition to how users will feel about exoskeletons, and how they may prefer to use exoskeletons, another important part of the equation is how exactly how workers may affiliate with the machines in a work context and what sort of relationship may exist between workers and exoskeletons. And all of this is different ""î and perhaps more useful ""î research than social scientists working with new technology generally do, Kirkwood argued, because it's in anticipation of a widespread change in how people and workers interact with technology, rather than a reaction to change which has already happened. ""Often one of the biggest problems ""î especially in the social sciences ""î is that we're really too reactive. Research about Facebook didn't happen until like several years after Facebook was actually being used by groups of people,""ù Kirkwood said. ""It's kind of neat where I see the relationship between social science researchers and industry. They need to be collaborating with each other so that we can help anticipate what might be some problematic issues before people start using [new] technology.""ù Comments are closed.

science,A Time For Reflection At Terror Rift,5-Feb-21,11:30 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-05/a-time-for-reflection-at-terror-rift/,"""All work that is done in Antarctica is hard and difficult,""ù Bruce Luyendyk, a professor emeritus and oceanographer with the Earth Research Institute at UC Santa Barbara, told me over Zoom. Research icebreaker N.B. Palmer in the sea ice of McMurdo Sound. Mount Erebus is in the background. This ship was used in UCSB surveys of the Terror Rift in the Ross Sea by Luyendyk and his students. Courtesy of Bruce Luyendyk The temperature is miserably, sometimes even incomprehensibly, cold. The weather can be inclement and stormy. On marine expeditions, sea ice and other hazards compound the work that researchers must do ""î and this work must be done in shifts, 24/7, around the clock.† The scenery, of course, also exemplifies a sublime, primordial and powerful beauty. This stark, desolate landscape distracts from the difficult nature of the work, at least for some people.† In the western Ross Sea, adjacent to the Ross Ice Shelf and the Transantarctic Mountains, exists Ross Island, a conglomerate of four volcanoes making up one of the highest islands in the world. Crowning Ross Island is Mount Erebus, a volcano which rises up 12,000 feet above sea level.† ""There's McMurdo Sound, and across the McMurdo Sound are the Transantarctic Mountains, which are as high as the Rocky Mountains, but they're coming out from sea level rather than 5 or 6,000 feet,""ù said Christopher Sorlien, a research geologist with UCSB's Earth Research Institute. ""So it's just incredible. It's an incredible sight.""ù† Luyendyk and Sorlien have been working in the region for decades, occasionally accompanied by undergraduate field assistants. A chunk of their research interests span the geologic history of the Ross Sea region, in particular the boundary between west and east Antarctica; there lies a deep basin near Ross Island that is hundreds of kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide, known as the Terror Rift.† To uncover the story of the region as told by the Terror Rift, Sorlien, Luyendyk and their collaborators with the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics in Trieste, Italy, have been working with seismic reflection data to construct seismic profiles and visualize faulting along the rift.† Faults are a common topic broached by Californians, particularly in Southern California where the periodic rumblings of earthquakes can sometimes prompt mention of ""The Big One,""ù a predicted cataclysmic earthquake set to strike the region. The expected cause of this would be a fault, specifically the San Andreas Fault, a boundary between the Pacific and North American plates which veers from north-south to east-west just north of Santa Barbara. From Santa Barbara county southward, it follows the Transverse Ranges before swiftly descending into the Salton Sink. The Terror Rift is similarly a plate boundary ""î or at least could be ""î between the eastern and western portions of the Antarctic continent. A big question for Luyendyk, Sorlien and their collaborators is just how long ago the rift was an active fault, or if the rift is even an active fault in the current moment. ""[We] care about that, because the plates that are hovering around on the Earth are all connected to one another, they're touching one another in some fashion, they're pulling apart, sliding past one another or going underneath one another,""ù Luyendyk said.† In order to understand how plates are moving with regards to one another, and particularly the rate at which they're moving, knowing the nature of plate motion and what is and isn't a current plate boundary is incredibly important, according to Luyendyk. Currently, to parse out plate motions in many regions, indirect measurements must be used. Understanding whether the Terror Rift divides two plates or only marks the boundary between old plates will generate ripples globally, as well as make computing plate motions in other regions significantly easier.† ""So that's why it's significant from a plate tectonics perspective. We want to know if it's active today, because that would allow us to correctly compute plate notions in places where it's very difficult to measure,""ù Luyendyk said.† Thus, the faulting of the Terror Rift needed to be mapped out and dissected methodically using seismic reflection data.† In seismic reflection, sound is transmitted down from a vessel toward the seafloor. This sound is reflected back toward the vessel; the different properties of Earth's layers ""î such as contrasts between different types of sediment ""î allows one to detect the shapes of different stratigraphic layers. ""So the speed of sound in each of the layers as you get down deeper affects these reflections which come back. You process this and get a profile which is like a cross-section† ""î but distorted ""î of the Earth. Then, you interpret that,""ù Sorlien said.† Through this, the researchers were able to glean the geologic history of the Terror Rift from changes in the thickness of sedimentary rock layers along the shoulders of the rift and the deepest section of the basin. According to Luyendyk, Sorlien and their collaborators, the Terror Rift has been moving since at least 29 million years ago in the south, and 21 million years ago in the north.† However, since 11 million years ago, there has been relatively little change or movement in the Terror Rift.† Luyendyk is hesitant to call the rift an active plate boundary at present because of this. Instead, he and his collaborators believe the culprit for this faulting is intraplate deformation, which occurs within a plate rather than at the boundary between two plates.† ""The [recent] deformation rates are so small ""¶ that it's almost kind of a ""òdoesn't matter' result,""ù Luyendyk said. ""But regardless, this study was done so carefully ""î it's such a comprehensive study ""î and it does show that there's different regions in this place, the Terror Rift, where we know it was a very active plate boundary 10 or 11 million years ago.""ù

science,"Independence the ‚""Right Way?‚""ù",6-Feb-21,11:30 PM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-06/independence-the-right-way/,"Independence as a global construct isn't always an accurate measure of self-esteem and happiness. Rather, according to Smaranda Lawrie, a doctoral student in UCSB's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, it is beneficial to recognize the varying meanings of independence among different cultures in trying to analyze the impact of independence on self-fulfillment. A crosswalk in Shinjuku, Tokyo. In their first study, Lawrie and collaborators used data from the U.S. and Japan, as well as Hungary and Romania from 736 undergraduate students. Courtesy of Pixabay Lawrie's background in cultural and positive psychology culminated in a study examining the correlation between self-esteem and independence between individualistic versus collectivist cultures.† ""We are simultaneously shaped by the multiple cultures we are immersed in and live in and these all have fundamental implications for how we think, how we feel, the types of relationships we hold, and more broadly how we experience the world,""ù Lawrie said. ""What cultural psychologists have found is that our brains are incredibly plastic and shaped to a great extent by our cultural experiences. Individuals from different cultures show different patterns of emotions, cognitions, perception and so forth.""ù Having lived across the world as well as within the United States, Lawrie's cross-cultural research was inspired by her own personal experiences and observations. Not only did her diverse experiences impact the scope of her research, they impacted her approach as well.† ""As a cultural psychologist interested in conducting research across different cultures, one of the most important things is the development of collaborations in different places, including in different countries,""ù Lawrie said. ""The conflation of different points of view and opinions ultimately makes our research more exciting and impactful.""ù The publication of her research involved collaboration with several individuals in Romania, Japan and New Zealand. In her research, Lawrie said she took a multi-methodological approach, using lab experiments, online surveys, secondary analyses of archival data and field studies. Because she and her fellow researchers needed to collect data from several different countries, they principally implemented a survey approach, including measures of independence, self-esteem and life satisfaction that had been validated in previous research.† The foundation of their cultural research rested on the characterization of culture as independent and individualistic or interdependent and collectivistic. Lawrie said she and her collaborators recently developed a scale called the ""Harmony and Convivial Collectivism Scale""ù to address the distinct shades of collectivism and emphasize differences in creating and maintaining relationships across cultures.† Past research, according to Lawrie, tells us that being independent leads to both higher self-esteem and higher life satisfaction wherever you live. In their first study, Lawrie and collaborators replicated and sought to confirm these findings, including data from the U.S. and Japan, as well as Hungary and Romania from 736 undergraduate students. Indeed, their findings did suggest that there is a universal mechanism by which independence did promote life satisfaction.† ""However, my experiences told me that independence looks very different in the United States and Romania [for instance],""ù Lawrie said. ""It means something different to be independent in these two countries.""ù Although the first study fortified previous findings that independence promotes self-satisfaction, it was culturally invariant and depended on a reduced and universal definition of independence.† In their second study, they explored different ways and interpretations of how being independent predicted self-esteem and satisfaction in the two countries more deeply. By treating independence as a more multidimensional and culturally impacted construct, Lawrie said they found significant variability in the meaning of independence and the degree to which it impacted self-fulfillment across cultures. ""For example, in the United States, independence means feeling different from others and experiencing the self as unique and that feels good,""ù Lawrie explained. ""In Romania, being independent has more to do with feeling like you are self-reliant and don't need to depend on others and that feels good.""ù The binary approach of their study allowed Lawrie and collaborators on the paper to develop more nuanced models of self within the cultures they researched. These findings, according to Lawrie, are especially important because they show how our psyche is inextricably linked to our environment, even in the ways we are gratified.† ""As social creatures and as cultural creatures, ultimately one feels good when one's way of being fits in and is valued in one's environment and context,""ù Lawrie said. ""Our research shows that independence is associated with self-esteem and satisfaction, yes, but it is about being the right kind of independent, the same kind of independent that is valued and respected by those people who live around you.""ù

Courtesy of Jeff Dozier. ""My colleagues, two partners that I was with at the time while climbing, asked ""òAre we in avalanche danger?' And we had no clue whether or not we were,""ù Dozier said. ""I realized that there was just really fascinating stuff going on with the snowpack,""ù Dozier said.† Upon returning to California, Dozier's interests in the physical properties of snow, surface climate and topographic variability converged and drew him towards the Sierra Nevada. California's quintessential mountain range, the Sierra Nevada, extends 400 miles from the southernmost tip of the Cascades down to the Transverse Ranges in southern California.† Dozier, Steven Sadro, James Sickman and John Melack, a professor of limnology and aquatic biology at UCSB, recently published ""Lakes and Watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California: Responses to Environmental Change,""ù a book focusing on the hydrology and biogeochemistry of the Sierra Nevada snowpack and high alpine lakes, as well as areas of concern for the mountain range in the coming decades. When Melack first began studying the Sierra Nevada, he was surprised to find very little information on what was going on within the lakes and streams throughout the range.† ""Even though you might think ""î with all the history and the University of California ""î there'd be a lot of information known about the Sierra Nevada lakes and streams, there basically was almost nothing ""¶ in terms of the chemistry and the biology,""ù Melack said.† Over the years, Dozier and Melack, working alongside innumerable collaborators, have sought to rectify this. ""Lakes and Watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California""ù is a consolidation of much of Dozier and Melack's research ""î as well as their collaborators.† Sadro and Sickman, professors at UC Davis and UC Riverside respectively, also co-authored the book alongside the two.† For decades, Dozier and Melack have worked in the Sierra Nevada, studying the range's snow hydrology and high elevation lakes, respectively. The two subjects are inextricably linked. The thousands of lakes which call the Sierra home are fed by snowmelt and occasionally remnant glaciers.† The Emerald Lake basin in winter. Courtesy of Jeff Dozier In addition, this snowmelt serves as a wintertime reservoir for lowland California's water supply, fueling the urban centers of Los Angeles and the Bay Area, as well as the enormously productive Central Valley and its agricultural industries. Melack has done extensive work studying the multitudinous high alpine lakes in the Sierra. In addition, Emerald Lake, a glacial cirque lake in the Tokopah Valley in Sequoia National Park ""î and a focus on the book ""î has been continuously studied since 1983. In particular, the book highlights issues the Sierra is facing which pertain to both climate and atmospheric deposition, such as acid rain.† For instance, in the 1980s, research into the effects of air pollution on lakes in Scandinavia ""î which devastated aquatic life in the region ""î prompted the California Air Resources Board to investigate whether the acid deposition plaguing aquatic life there could also impact the Sierra Nevada alpine lakes. ""Since the Sierra Nevada is mostly underlaid by very hard granitic rocks, the water in the Sierra is chemically dilute and doesn't have very much ability to resist being acidified from atmospheric deposition,""ù Melack said.† However, studies examining the Sierran lakes have discerned that, for the most part, the lakes remain unaffected by acid deposition.† Changes in snow cover will certainly also affect the lakes of the Sierra, according to Melack, with shorter periods of ice cover and longer periods of open water causing lakes to warm up sooner in the dry months and stay warm longer, accelerating the biological processes occurring within the lakes.† In addition, the Sierra Nevada are noteworthy for being, like the rest of California, hugely variable in precipitation from year to year. ""A big part of the book is examining this huge interannual variability. 80% of our precipitation comes in six or 10 storms,""ù Dozier said. For researchers working with the Sierra's temperamental rainfall, patterns in precipitation over time have been hard to uncover because of these characteristic swings.† However, according to Dozier, one pattern has emerged in recent years with particular clarity: As the Sierra Nevada and the rest of California warm, some of the precipitation in the mid-elevations currently falling as snow will instead fall as rain. ""That's gonna change a lot in terms of water management in California. For one thing, it means that we're gonna get runoff from the Sierra before we need it,""ù Dozier said.†† Dozier and Melack both hope that their book will serve as a solid resource, whether they be land managers, researchers or any others who seek a synthesis of knowledge about the water of the Sierra, the manner in which it exists on the landscape and how it may change over time.† ""If you're worried about climate change in California, probably the Sierra Nevada is the place that's going to be affected the most.""ù† Comments are closed.

Ernestine Ygnacio-De Soto, a Barbare√±o Chumash Elder, spoke alongside members of Channel Island Restoration and Save the San Marcos Foothills. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus The San Marcos Foothills Preserve is a protected area encompassing 200 acres of oak savanna and grassland between Santa Barbara and Goleta in the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains. It is one of the largest and most productive grasslands in Santa Barbara County, according to Channel Islands Restoration (CIR), which has been performing habitat restoration on the preserve and the surrounding undeveloped land ""î including West Mesa ""î since 2010. The group, represented by attorney Marc Chytilo, has filed eight appeals of the Santa Barbara Architectural Board of Review's approval of eight homes set to be built on West Mesa, a parcel of undeveloped open space immediately adjacent to the San Marcos Foothills Preserve. Save the San Marcos Foothills has also filed a lawsuit against Santa Barbara County for issuing easements which would permit the installation of flood control structures on county park land, according to Chytilo.† The organization is concerned that these would significantly damage the undeveloped grassland and the surrounding watershed, Nancy Tubiolo, an organizer of the demonstration, said in an interview with the Nexus.† ""I think our environment is so important that it's worth the very uncomfortable legal actions that we've had to take,""ù Tubiolo said.† Held at the entrance to the preserve, the demonstration opened with a blessing by Ernestine Ygnacio-De Soto, a Barbare√±o Chumash Elder. Ygnacio-De Soto expressed solidarity with Save the San Marcos Foothills and acknowledged the cultural heritage of the Chumash Nation which exists on the land.† The dispute can be traced to the mid-2000s, when the Chadmar Group, the development company in ownership of the undeveloped land, purchased 377 acres of land in the foothills with the intent of setting aside the vast majority for preservation ""î with one exception being a parcel of land on the West Mesa. Initially, the organizers were hoping to be able to buy the undeveloped acreage at ""fair-market value,""ù estimated by CIR to be worth 5.5 million dollars. At the time of publication Save the San Marcos Foothills has raised 1.3 million through CIR, including 1 million dollars from an anonymous donor in early October. However, even if Save the San Marcos Foothills is able to raise 5.5 million dollars to buy the land slated for development, they still may not actually have enough to purchase it. The developer's valuation of the proposed development is much higher ""î within the realm of 16 million dollars, according to CIR.† The homes slated for development on the West Mesa were originally approved in 2005. However, this was before the Eastern Goleta Valley Community Plan was adopted, a policy which sets stringent standards for new development in order to protect the aesthetic beauty of the area. Chytilo is using this as the basis for the appeals.† ""When [the construction] was approved in 2005, there was not a requirement to consider the scenic views of this property from other vantage points throughout the community so now there are new policies that require that,""ù Chytilo said in an interview with the Nexus.† ""Those are issues that we're going to be arguing to the Planning Commission, as they consider those eight appeals.""ù Elihu Gevirtz, the senior ecologist with CIR, also stressed the ecological importance of the preserve and its role in linking other habitats on the South Coast and playing host to various bird species whose numbers have recently declined, including white-tailed kite, marsh hawk, meadowlark and burrowing owls.† ""They all depend on this grassland. And my fear is that if this property is allowed to be developed then it'll be another chink in the armor where these birds disappear,""ù Gevirtz said.†† ""The same birds that appear here also occur on More Mesa which is just a few miles away. And so there's a connection ""î there's so few grasslands left in this region that they're all just incredibly important.""ù However, for others, the potential loss of the grassland hits closer to home. The preserve is also beloved among many local recreationists for its accessibility, scenic views and sentimental value.† ""This whole area ""î it's like losing a friend ""¶ I've come up here for solace knowing that this was always here. This is like someone very dear to us and I'm like ""òOh my gosh! They're gonna take it away,'""ù Tubiolo said.†
Print From what I have read it is homes on 25 acres. The owners are only allowed to landscape a small portion of the property around the home. The rest of the property is left in a natural state. The developer gave over 300 acres to the public. It would seem this is a win for the environment. Nobody wants to give the 300 acres back if developers are not allowed to build.

science,UCSB Professor Who Invented Blue LEDs Wins Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering,25-Feb-21,12:00 AM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-25/ucsb-professor-who-invented-blue-leds-wins-queen-elizabeth-prize-for-engineering/,"Today, blue light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, quite literally surround us nearly everywhere we go. They are in our homes, our TVs and our phones. Nakamura was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of blue LED. Courtesy of Shuji Nakamura The origin of blue LED technology traces back to Japan in the late ""ò80s, at a small chemical and electronics company called Nichia Corporation. Shuji Nakamura† ""ì a UC Santa Barbara faculty member since 2000 ""ì†developed this technology when he was a member of the research and development team at Nichia. His work has laid the foundation for much of the lighting technology we use today.† On Feb. 2, Nakamura earned the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, one of the most prestigious awards in the field of engineering, for the development of blue LED technology alongside his collaborators Isamu Akasaki, Nick Holonyak Jr., M. George Craford and Russell Dupuis. In light of his recent award, Nakamura credits Chancellor Henry T. Yang and the UCSB staff and faculty of the engineering department for their support. ""Among the engineering prizes, the [Queen Elizabeth prize] is among the most prestigious because, you know, everyone knows Queen Elizabeth,""ù Nakamura said. ""So I'm so surprised and happy. Since 2000, Chancellor Henry Yang especially has supported me. I have been here for over 20 years, and without the support [of him, staff and faculty], I would not survive, so I appreciate them a lot.""ù But back when blue LED technology was just a concept, Nakumura was just one of the 160 employees at Nichia. Despite his fervent desire to research and develop the technology, his proposal was initially rejected by his boss. ""Almost every time I talked to my boss, I'd joke, ""òWhy don't you do blue LED research at our company?'""ù Nakamura said. ""[He'd respond,] ""òYou're joking. My company is small, we have no money, no brains, no background in semiconductor technology.'""ù At the time, Nichia only specialized in preparing materials for traditional infrared and red LED lights. Nakamura was tasked with developing more conventional technology at the time and would be for nearly 10 years, even though what he wanted to do was at the cutting edge.† So Nakamura's idea remained just that ""ì†an idea ""ì†for a decade, until he pitched the same idea directly to the chairman of Nichia, Nobuo Ogawa. Ogawa was willing to provide the funding for the research project and Nakamura was given the green light to develop blue light. Blue LED was the final piece of the puzzle of creating the white LED light that floods our lives today. Nakamura created a high-quality system to develop the growth of gallium nitride, which is a compound found in blue LED. In 1993, Nakamura succeeded in making a prototype almost three times as bright as other blue LEDs developed at the time. In 1995, he developed a green LED of a similar magnitude of brightness. His work has made lighting and displays brighter and more efficient and allowed for the creation of white LEDs. He is also credited for the blue laser diodes used in Blu-ray and HD DVDs.† Since 1995, Nakamura has received numerous accolades for his achievements in the field, namely his efforts to create cheap and efficient sources of light. He is now working on ways that LED and UV can be used to eradicate potential viruses on surfaces as general lighting in high-traffic areas. Nakamura was famously awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2014 for the invention of blue LED, alongside his collaborators Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano.† Nakamura said that another current focus of his is laser lighting, which he says is more efficient in material use, and even brighter than LED lighting.† ""Laser lighting can extend one kilometer ahead,""ù Nakamura said. ""LED lighting can only go 300 meters ahead. That is our dream right now. We are working very hard to develop efficient power with UV and laser lighting.""ù

From 1996 to 2016, the percentage of undergraduate students of color in the United States increased from 29.6% to 45.2%, according to a report by the American Council on Education. Currently, Tettegah and her collaborators have been gathering data from students as part of a broader self-assessment of UCSB's current climate and practices.†Emily Liu / Daily Nexus Despite these gains, however, S.T.E.M. fields remain skewed, with Black and Hispanic students significantly underrepresented. Zooming in on the demographics of faculty, staff and administrators in these fields, the majority of positions are filled by white people. There are problems with this even beyond a socioeconomic lens, Sharon Tettegah, the director of the Center for Black Studies Research (CBSR) at UC Santa Barbara and a professor in the Department of Black Studies, explained in an interview with the Nexus. Since 2018, when Tettegah first began working at UCSB, these issues have underpinned much of her work on campus. ""If you don't have a diverse group of people involved in S.T.E.M. then you're not going to have those voices, and innovation comes out of that diversity,""ù Tettegah said.† Of particular importance for Tettegah is S.T.E.M. and data science engagement with underrepresented groups on campus. Tettagah has been working alongside Kenneth Kosik and Timothy Sherwood ""î† the Harriman professor of neuroscience and a professor of computer science at UCSB, respectively ""î to bring in more people from historically underrepresented groups to data science and S.T.E.M. fields. Tettegah and Kosik teamed up to establish the Neuro-Computational Center, which aims to bring more Black students into the field of neurocomputation with the help of mentors from historically underrepresented groups who do work in the field.† In addition, a 2020 Award for Inclusion Research from Google AI has awarded Sherwood and Tettegah funding to create a pipeline for collaboration between the CBSR and the Department of Computer Science. ""Data science is everywhere. And a lot of times people don't think about computational data science beyond just S.T.E.M., but literally, people are grappling with it in probably any field or discipline of study. It's really a thing that is at the convergence of everything,""ù Tettegah said. ""There's all these initiatives on data science on campus. But there had not been a focus specifically on underrepresented groups.""ù† In the future, a goal of Tettegah and her collaborators is to place an emphasis on first-year students in particular and get them involved in data science as part of the broader push to get historically underrepresented groups into S.T.E.M. Tettegah also currently co-leads Aspire: The National Alliance for Inclusive & Diverse S.T.E.M. Faculty at UCSB alongside Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Belinda Robnett. Aspire is an initiative led by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities to diversify S.T.E.M. faculty on campus and cultivate a more inclusive climate among the various S.T.E.M. departments at UCSB. UCSB is part of a cohort of 19 universities involved with Aspire.† ""It's focused on faculty, which eventually trickles down to students because if you have diverse faculty, it's more likely you're going to attract diverse students ""¶† the whole goal is to increase and retain diverse faculty,""ù Tettegah said.†† In addition to drawing in people from underrepresented groups through outreach, Tettegah has also been engaged in an investigation into how teaching methods may be causing a demographic skew in S.T.E.M. fields, particularly engineering. ""I think it may have something to do with this kind of epistemology ""î how you come to know things,""ù Tettegah said.† ""When you look at how universities are training and educating students in S.T.E.M., you have a very, very, as far as I'm concerned, outdated approach to teaching and learning.""ù Tettegah's latest project ""î a component of Aspire ""î takes aim at current approaches to teaching and learning in the university setting, attempting to better understand ""user preferences""ù in engineering education: what best engages students and helps them retain information in the context of the mediums and methods used to teach class curriculums.† Currently, Tettegah and her collaborators have been gathering data from students as part of a broader self-assessment of UCSB's current climate and practices.† Through this, she is hoping to help educators in engineering ""î and† S.T.E.M. more broadly ""î in their quest to diversify content and go beyond traditional means of teaching which may not be as accessible to students.† ""If you're in a course, do you have a preference for individual content that's just equations only? Or do you like images, or do you like to see simulations of these things?""ù Tettegah said.† All of these initiatives ""î if they lead to the change Tettegah is hoping they'll lead to ""î could amount to a paradigm shift. ""It's a different approach, and we've never collected this kind of data before. Never collected data around user preferences. It's not even been done at the K-12 level,""ù Tettegah said.† ""Think about how you were educated and how you were taught. What opportunities were provided to you?

science,UCSB STEM Disciplines Come Together To Study Cell Polarization,28-Feb-21,8:55 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-28/ucsb-stem-disciplines-come-together-to-study-cell-polarization/,"Increasingly, disciplines like physics have found a home in research into biology ""î particularly research looking at the functioning of biological systems within and between cells. A row of yeast cells with glowing-green polarization caps. Courtesy of Carlos Gomez Researchers working at UC Santa Barbara, including Samhita Banavar, a former graduate student in the department of physics who is now at Stanford University, Otger Camp√†s, with the California NanoSystems Institute, Michael Trogdon and Linda R. Petzold in the department of mechanical engineering and Tau-Mu Yi in the department of molecular, cell and developmental biology, in addition to Brian Drawert from the department of computer science at the University of North Carolina Asheville, exemplify this boundary-pushing way of thinking. Their interdisciplinary work, published in PLOS ONE, devised a theoretical model which used physics to better understand morphogenesis, the process by which cells take shape.† ""I've always been interested in morphogenesis, especially looking at it from a physics point of view, rather than the typical biology point of view,""ù Banavar said.† Banavar and her collaborators looked into the mating machinations of yeast cells, which have a rigid cell wall in addition to the cell membrane observed in normal animals cells. When yeast cells mate with other cells, they ""î lacking the ability to move to one another ""î grow projections in order to reach their soon-to-be mate. In essence, rather than move, yeast cells ""stretch,""ù aided by the lure of pheromones.† She and her collaborators were interested in understanding how cells understand their own geometry, know where to grow and ultimately maintain polarization, the process in which the components within cells transition from a uniform distribution to a localized distribution for growth or movement.† ""And so at the polarized region you can start growing, or you could start moving ""î sometimes movement is in a polarized fashion,""ù Banavar explained.† As yeast cells grow to meet their would-be mates, the cell wall at the site of polarization ""î the polarization cap, as Banavar and her collaborators describe ""î must add material at a rate comparable to the rate that the cell itself is expanding.† ""The pressure inside the yeast cell is very high, and so it could very easily break that wall. And so the question becomes how does the cell coordinate. How does it say, ""òOh, we need material at this location to grow the wall,'""ù Banavar said.† If the cell wasn't able to maintain this, there would be dire consequences. For instance, some yeast cells which have been experimentally modified and are unable to grow in the manner they are supposed to end up ""popping,""ù for instance. This gruesome fate, however, is not common by any means in nature. Banavar and her collaborators believe they may have an answer for why that is.† Through theoretical modeling, the researchers discovered that cells require a feedback mechanism, one linking the cell's rate of expansion and the rate by which the cell wall secretes material. There must be coordination between forces governing the cell as it expands. In the absence of the mechanical feedback encoded in the cell, as described by Banavar and her collaborators model, cell polarity cannot be maintained, the yeast cell's polarization cap moves away from the tip where growth is directed, and morphogenesis cannot continue. Tragically, the yeast cells remain a projection-length away, unable to mate, forever alone. Drawing from previous research, Banavar and her collaborators looked toward a known biological pathway, the Cell Wall Integrity pathway, which encodes mechanical feedback in the cell genetically and is able to sense stress in the cell wall, providing the cell with the information needed to maintain cell polarization during growth. Adding strong enough mechanical feedback, however, fixes this.†† ""We're thinking that [the Cell Wall Integrity pathway] is the pathway that could solve this problem,""ù Banavar said. ""Of course, it still does have to be experimentally proven.""ù† Even so, Banavar is interested to see how this work informs future research into similar mechanisms in other pathways and systems ""î not to mention future research into the Cell Wall Integrity pathway itself ""î especially as physics and physical mechanisms are increasingly identified as being important for biological systems. ""And so the physics of the system is quite interesting and should be studied along with the biology. Linking them through these mechanical feedbacks and seeing how the two kind of interplay is very interesting. I think it can help us understand morphogenesis in various systems ""î including multicellular tissues,""ù Banavar said.

science,Blum Center at UCSB Hosts Public Forum To Discuss Post-Pandemic Green New Deal,3-Mar-21,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-03/blum-center-at-ucsb-hosts-public-forum-to-discuss-post-pandemic-green-new-deal/,"On Wednesday, Feb. 24, the Blum Center on Poverty, Inequality and Democracy at UC Santa Barbara hosted a public forum, ""The Green New Deal in Action,""ù to discuss the relevance of the mammoth policy initiative to residents of the Santa Barbara area and other communities in the Central Coast. A booth hosted by Sunrise Movement during the pre-pandemic Dec. 6, 2019 climate strike. Sophia Lovell / Daily Nexus Over 130 people attended the public forum, including UCSB students, I.V. residents and others in the broader Goleta area. Championed by the Sunrise Movement and other figures in the progressive movement, including politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey, the Green New Deal refers to various public policy proposals intended to simultaneously address climate change, create jobs and reduce economic inequality. In October 2019, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the Blum Center held an in-person public forum focusing on how the Green New Deal could be used as an ""organizing framework""ù to unite the social and environmental justice movements of the Central Coast, according to a press release. This second public forum focused instead on how the pandemic and recent socio-political shifts have impacted the prospects for ""transformative economic and environmental change,""ù according to the press release. Held over Zoom, the Fund for Santa Barbara and CLUE Santa Barbara also partnered with the Blum Center to host the panel discussion which happened within the forum. This panel featured speakers from UCSB faculty and other organizations in the broader community, notably David Pellow, a UCSB professor and the chair of the Environmental Studies Department, Nikayla Jefferson, an organizer with the Sunrise Movement and a doctoral student of political science at UCSB, Ana Rosa Rizo-Centino, the executive director of One Step A La Vez and Nadia Lee Abushanab, the advocacy and event director with the Santa Barbara County Action Network (SBCAN). The forum also served to inaugurate a year-long student-led initiative at the Blum Center, The People's Guide to the Green New Deal, a project intended to provide an ""accessible overview of what that Green New Deal hopes to achieve and why; when this proposal emerged and its historical roots; its main advocates, critics, and overlooked voices; and where and how it is being used in various regions across the country,""ù according to a statement released by the Blum Center. The role of indigenous communities in the Central Coast and the Green New Deal's relevance to them featured prominently. One speaker before the panel, Marcos Vargas, the executive director of the FUND for Santa Barbara voicing and a sun dancer in the Lakota tradition, voiced support for the confirmation of Debra Haaland, President Joe Biden's pick to run the United States Secretary of the Interior. Haaland would be the first Native American woman to helm the hugely influential executive department. ""We continue to struggle with cultural, economic and political self-determination. Chumash leaders, along with native and indigenous people from around the world continue to prioritize their connection with the land. Indigenous leaders are at the forefront of the fight to protect the land and the water,""ù Vargas said. Pellow discussed Santa Barbara's need to improve climate resilience and disaster preparedness, embrace sustainable agriculture, improve public transportation, end offshore oil production and expand affordable housing, among other things. The role of working-class people in crafting policy also became a topic of interest, with Rizo-Centino discussing the necessity for policy solutions to take into account both climate and environment as well as the needs of those who have been historically marginalized. Rizo-Centino in particular stressed the importance of ensuring that a green economy is not predicated on inequality. ""What kind of jobs are we going to create, and are they going to be living-wage jobs? ""¶ Black and indigenous people of color are so often asked for labor and not given anything in exchange for it,""ù Rizo-Centino said. Meanwhile, Abushanab mentioned many of SBCAN's current initiatives, including stopping development in the San Marcos Foothills, advocating for affordable housing in Santa Maria and the reduction of cash bail and monitoring the county redistricting process, as well as how these initiatives are guided by principles in accordance with the Green New Deal. In an interview with the Nexus, Simone Stewart, a speaker during the public forum and a student assistant at the Blum Center, elaborated on the various ways in which the pandemic has complicated the grassroots organizing which initially propelled the Green New Deal to national prominence in 2019. ""One of the best parts to me about the Green New Deal is this capability for organizing at lots of different levels""¶ with the pandemic, it's more difficult now to get people in the same room together. I think that's definitely one way the pandemic has changed things,""ù Stewart said. However, despite these challenges ""î and the mounting costs of the pandemic both in terms of loss of life and the intensification of inequality ""î Stewart still expressed optimism, particularly in the wake of Biden's ascension to the presidency. ""I think there is no longer the question of ""òDo we need to do this?' I think that was a big part of the Trump administration ""¶ whereas I think the Biden administration has made it pretty clear that this is a priority,""ù Stewart said. Meanwhile, Jefferson during the panel emphasized the importance of a different, more distant sort of optimism. She described her own vision of an ideal future and how she'd used it to rouse her into action, even in times ""heavy with death and despair.""ù ""When I close my eyes and I picture driving from San Diego north on Highway 99 to visit my brother-in-law before I spend the weekend in the Sierras, I see the Green New Deal alive on my route. I see sustainable agriculture throughout the valley grown with care for our planet and our bodies and the migrant workers,""ù Jefferson said. ""I see the rest stops aligned with charging stations. I stopped off to charge my own car. I need a quick snack. I enjoy a spring sunset on the crisp and smog-less horizon, fresh air in the valley and the rumble of the high-speed train carrying people to North Sacramento.""ù Comments are closed.

According to Douglas Kennett, a professor of anthropology at UC Santa Barbara, this was due to a lack of sufficient ancient and present-day DNA sampling.† A pastoral landscape in Mongolia, which was part of the interior route of migration for anatomically modern humans. Courtesy of the Feed Project That was, until recent developments in DNA collecting in the past five years allowed researchers to generate genome-wide ancestry data for present-day and ancient individuals.† ""The last five years have been a game changer for our collective understanding of the Earth's population history,""ù Kennett said.† Along with new radiocarbon methods developed by his own team, the new knowledge supplied by better technology allowed Kennett and his research group to determine the timing of ancestry change and population movements.† In collaboration for over four years with dozens of researchers, notably David Reich, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, Kennett has been working on an ancient genome project focused on the spread of anatomically modern humans and their expansion in the last 10,000 years. This expansion, Kennett said, is associated with the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of agriculture in multiple core regions of the world. As an archaeologist with a specific interest in learning the implications of how people have interacted with and changed the environment over time, this project was of particular interest.† ""Understanding the Earth's human population history is an essential part of this and the paper contributes to our understanding of East Asia, including China, Mongolia, Japan and Taiwan,""ù Kennett said.† Despite the range of techniques that Kennett's team developed to maximize their ability to detect and extract ancient DNA, working with those samples remained tricky, as DNA is often poorly preserved, and organic materials that are directly radiocarbon dated are often highly degraded. While the technology has progressed enough to render a higher volume of DNA viable for analysis, Kennett said that the team had many failed attempts to generate the data presented in the study.† Yet, data that was collected showed that the earliest anatomically modern humans arrived in East Asia within the last 50,000 years, moving along a coastal route from Southeast Asia and through China and Japan. A separate interior route of migration was detected through Mongolia.† ""We also documented the expansion of three farming populations in East Asia in the last 10,000 years that are strongly tied to the distribution of modern language groups today,""ù Kennett said.† The Earth's population history is highly complex, Kennett said, and it also informs the environmental impacts that anatomically modern humans have had in the last 150,000 years as they migrated across the globe.† ""It shows a recurring pattern of rapidly increasing populations from centers of domestication and agriculture followed by the expansion of farmers with new technologies into adjacent regions,""ù Kennett said. †""These are processes still occurring today and our work is highly relevant given the environmental and societal challenges we face as the Earth's population approaches 8 billion.""ù

science,UCSB Researchers Uncover a Hydrocarbon Cycle Beneath the Ocean,14-Mar-21,4:00 PM,['Mackenzie Miller'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-14/ucsb-researchers-uncover-a-hydrocarbon-cycle-beneath-the-ocean/,"Environmental restoration after oil spills can take years due to how difficult it can be to completely eradicate oil from the site of the spill. Clumps of tar may sink and escape cleaning methods, leading to widespread environmental consequences.† This new knowledge will allow for better oil spill response in the future, according to Love. Courtesy of Flickr However, a recent discovery made by a research team at UC Santa Barbara suggests that an unsuspecting group of bacteria may just be the clean-up crew that the ocean needs. Among those researchers is Connor Love, a doctoral student studying earth science. For almost five years, he has been working on this project as part of an effort to accurately measure levels of hydrocarbon in the ocean. Hydrocarbon compounds are found in petroleum from oil spills but they are also produced naturally by aquatic cyanobacteria. Love describes it as a """"òsteady hum' of natural hydrocarbons.""ù Ocean microbes then break down these compounds and produce carbon dioxide which cyanobacteria use to produce more hydrocarbons. Love said that this effectively creates a massive hydrocarbon cycle that produces 500 times the amount of hydrocarbon than from human oil input.† However, rapid oil spillage can have a very different effect on ocean environments than this steady hydrocarbon production. Petroleum contains a wide variety of hydrocarbons that not all microbes may be able to break down.† ""The ocean has an inherent capacity to handle the natural and steady input of hydrocarbons from seeps and cyanobacteria, but they will not be able to fully consume the excessive amounts of hydrocarbons that we keep spilling,""ù Love explained. Love and his team were interested in measuring the size of this cycle and better understanding the different bacteria involved. The research team discovered that this hydrocarbon cycle can† ""prime""ù the ocean to be better at handling the consequences of an oil spill. Microbes that constantly break down hydrocarbons from cyanobacteria, as well as from nearby oil seeps, may be more equipped to handle the effects of a large oil spill.†† However, to obtain this newfound information, the team had to go out into the open ocean to collect bacterial cells on filters and then extract the hydrocarbons directly from the filter. According to Love, this was quite a grueling process for the researchers.† ""It was honestly extremely taxing work, about 18 hours a day of just hard work, covered in salt, on a rocking boat,""ù Love said. They did this for three weeks while aboard the R/V (short for Research Vessel) Neil Armstrong in the North Atlantic Ocean. But there were still perks to the job. Love remembered how ""during [the] in-between moments, everything is more raw from exhaustion and people are more themselves, there are no ""òreal world' distractions.""ù On top of these conditions, Love said their team faced more challenges. The diesel fuel from the boat could easily contaminate their samples because it is made up of many hydrocarbon compounds. This included pentadecane, which is the specific compound also produced by cyanobacteria that they were trying to isolate. The team took several precautions which paid off.† ""We had clean samples with no contamination and enough biological material to work with which was a huge win for everyone involved,""ù Love said. Ultimately, the arduous work and less-than-perfect conditions paid off. This new knowledge will allow for better oil spill response in the future. The spill clean up can now be catered to the specific ocean region and which types of microbes reside there, making restoration more efficient. While this is a huge step towards ocean restoration, it will not be a quick fix. Hydrocarbon-consuming organisms cannot just be released into the ocean when a spill occurs. While this method has been utilized for land spills,† the naturally occurring bacteria ""will tend to out-compete any microbes that are engineered in a lab and released into the ocean,""ù Love said. Prior to their findings, the extent of the ocean hydrocarbon cycle was largely unknown. Past research projects have been able to measure cyanobacterial production in the lab but Love said this is the first time that researchers were able to accurately measure this cycle in the ocean. ""[We can] use the knowledge of what compounds the microbes are consuming and what rate they consume these compounds in a spill scenario, from this we can be a sort of spill response teammate to the microbes and fill in the gaps that they can't,""ù Love explained.†

science,COVID-19 Vaccines: How They Work and Why You Should Get One,14-Mar-21,11:52 PM,['Michelle J. Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-14/covid-19-vaccines-how-they-work-and-why-you-should-get-one/,"Since breaking news of the highly effective and newly available COVID-19 vaccines, there's been palpable anticipation and hope in how I've heard people talk about the future. To date, over 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States. The results have been overwhelmingly positive and a world without COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing feels closer than it has in the past year. Yet for each person ready for the vaccine and planning out a return to normalcy, there is another who might be deliberating over how it works and if they will choose to get vaccinated. Importantly, these futures are intertwined and we cannot have a future free of COVID-19 restrictions without widespread vaccination. So, here is what you need to know about the several COVID-19 vaccines currently available and what they mean for you, your friends, your family and our UC Santa Barbara community. A vial containing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Courtesy of the Department of Defense How do vaccines work?† To start our conversation about vaccines, let's first get on the same page ""î how does a viral vaccine work? First, vaccines take harmless parts or versions of a virus and allow our immune system to build up a defense against them before coming into contact with the actual dangerous, live virus. Vaccines like the annual flu vaccine, the chickenpox vaccine and the measles vaccine use dead (inactivated) or weakened (live-attenuated) versions of the virus. The dead or weakened virus is injected into your arm where your body's white blood cells recognize the foreign antigens, build up a specialized defense based on the virus's appearance and attack the virus. Importantly, your body stores this information in its memory immune cells so, if you were to encounter the live virus in the future, your body would quickly recognize and destroy the virus particles before it can make you sick. Thus, you are immune. From start to finish, a vaccine gives your body the opportunity to build up a defense and memory of the virus in question. What is an mRNA vaccine and how does it work? Vaccines that use messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA, rather than dead or weakened viral bodies have the same goal: The vaccine introduces and prepares the body's immune system with a harmless part of the virus. Rather than using a dead or weakened part of the virus, mRNA vaccines provide a recipe that the body uses to build an identifying feature on the virus' surface. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), this identifying feature is the spike protein on the cell surface. The mRNA in the vaccine is taken up by our cells around the injection site, upon which our cell's protein-reading machinery reads and converts the mRNA recipe into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Once your cells begin producing the spike protein, your immune system perks up and begins to notice these foreign bodies. Your body builds up a specialized attack against the protein and commits it to memory, ready for a time when these immune cells might encounter the protein again, say, on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself. Dzwokai Zach Ma, a professor and researcher at UC Santa Barbara studying virus-host interactions in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB), emphasized a few important points in this process: ""(1) Since only the spike protein is generated inside the cells, the vaccine will NOT cause COVID-19. (2) The mRNA does not enter your cell's nucleus, and thus, does not interact with your genomic DNA. (3) The mRNA will eventually be degraded and eliminated from your cells.""ù These points help remind us of the safety of the mRNA vaccines and address some of the concerns that some might have about the vaccine. Moreover, while many of us have never heard of mRNA vaccines, Ma noted, ""these vaccines have been the focus of active research for the last two decades. Pfizer and Moderna already had the infrastructure to conduct the research and production of the two mRNA vaccines we now have available in the United States.""ù Indeed, the past two to three decades of research in mRNA vaccines perfectly positioned Pfizer and Moderna to quickly create, test and manufacture their mRNA vaccines. ""The conventional method where you have to produce, isolate, and purify a large amount of a dead/weakened virus or a recombinant viral protein, takes a long time,""ù Ma said. He explained that, in contrast, ""you can standardize the large-scale production of mRNA vaccines. [Researchers] can also easily use the existing recipe to target any parts of the virus, including those of new variants as they arise.""ù Ma continued, ""mRNA, while quick to produce, is also quick to breakdown. That is why the two current vaccines need to be stabilized at very low temperatures (Moderna at -20∞Celsius and Pfizer at -80∞Celsius, and recently approved by the FDA for -20∞Celsius for two weeks).""ù In sum, mRNA vaccines have the same goal as vaccines that we are more familiar with. The differences between these mRNA and traditional vaccines are the molecular technologies that have been leveraged to make them. Adenovirus vaccines: Adenovirus vaccines are another kind of vaccine recently approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and soon to be distributed by Johnson & Johnson. Oxford-Astrazeneca has also produced an adenovirus vaccine, but this brand has not been approved for use in the United States, as of March 14. Again, adenovirus vaccines ""î just like dead/weakened virus and mRNA vaccines ""î work to expose the immune system to a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in preparation for an encounter with the real virus. Quite similar to the mRNA vaccines, adenovirus vaccines insert the encoded recipe (this time in the form of DNA) for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into an adenovirus vector, or the shell of a type of virus that usually causes cold or flu-like symptoms. In this case, the vector has been disabled and cannot cause sickness. After entering the cell, the viral vector utilizes the cell's protein-making machinery to produce the spike protein, triggering your immune system to build up a defense. This vaccine uses SARS-CoV-2 DNA rather than mRNA to transfer the spike protein recipe. Again, the DNA is packaged within the adenovirus vector, which is disabled and lacks the genetic programming to replicate or cause infection. Both the switch to DNA, which is less prone to degradation than RNA, and the adenovirus vector make the vaccine more stable and amenable to refrigerator storage. In contrast to its Pfizer and Moderna counterparts, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can handle some tougher conditions. Adenovirus vaccines may sound familiar to those who are tuned in to the vaccine research world, as Johnson & Johnson recently created an adenovirus vaccine for the Ebola virus. Increasingly, the technology for mRNA and adenovirus vaccines will become a part of our vaccine lexicon as these methods have proven over time to be efficient, effective and safe. Vaccine trials and FDA approval: Scott Grafton, the UCSB campus COVID-19 coordinator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, spoke about vaccine trials during ""The Science Behind COVID-19 Vaccines and Other Interventions""ù panel that was hosted by The Current on Feb. 25. Grafton noted that ""for the FDA to approve the vaccine, the maker has to show that it prevents disease 50% of the time. All three currently available vaccines are all greater than 90% effective at protecting against hospitalization, severe disease and death ""î way above the low bar set by the FDA,""ù Grafton said in reference to the Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. He continued, ""The two RNA vaccines are also 90% effective at reducing or preventing mild and moderate illness, while the J&J is comparatively 66% effective.""ù One common misconception about the current COVID-19 vaccines is that the process of their approval was too speedy. As we just learned, researchers have responded to this concern by emphasizing the existing research in mRNA vaccines and the ease of mRNA production. Medical professionals have also emphasized the bureaucratic prioritization of this vaccine production and the prevalence and virulence of the COVID-19 virus for trials and testing. Lynn Fitzgibbons, physician and infectious disease specialist for Cottage Health, said, ""We've never had groups like the FDA and other branches of regulatory agencies work around the clock, making sure that all avoidable delays were avoided ""¶ In our lifetime, we've never had the ability to get 100,000 people signed up for a vaccine clinical trial within a month the way that our vaccine manufacturers were able to do last year.""ù Once a vaccine is in the stage of clinical trials, vaccine approval is based on the proportion of infected versus non-infected participants. The number of infected trial-participants needs to reach some threshold in order to prove efficacy. Ma explained, ""In the past when you want to test the efficacy of a vaccine, you have to wait for your patients to experience natural infection rates. Years down the line you can collect enough data for vaccine approval. Due to the prevalence of COVID-19 right now, many people in the trials got infected in a short amount of time. This shortened the period to determine the efficacy of these vaccines.""ù Thus, the usual delays in vaccine trial sign-ups and vaccine approval have not been an issue due to the seriousness of the pandemic and the prioritization of these trials. The high prevalence and infection rate of COVID-19 not only made vaccine trials a priority for agencies like the FDA, but it also created the conditions under which the vaccine could be quickly tested for efficacy. No steps were skipped. Rather, the virus itself created the conditions for speedy vaccine approval. Herd Immunity:  For the same reason many of us get the annual flu shot, the goal of COVID-19 vaccination and immunization is to protect yourself and the people around you from getting sick. ""Young people can still get COVID-19 and you never know how severely your body will react to the virus,""ù Ma said. ""And as we know, even if you have mild or no symptoms, you can still pass it on to others. In addition, there is increasing evidence suggesting that a fraction of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 may experience long-lasting symptoms.""ù Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons When our government officials talk about returning to life without COVID-19 restrictions, they often refer to herd immunity as some benchmark of community safety. Herd immunity refers to the inability of the virus to move from person to person due to a high proportion of pre-existing immunity in the population from vaccination or previous infection. Thus, immune people act as barriers against the virus for the less common person that is not vaccinated and has never encountered the virus. When it comes to COVID-19, Ma said, ""It is estimated that 70-90% of the population would need to either get vaccinated or contract COVID-19 in order to achieve herd immunity.""ù This ballpark figure of approximately 80% of the population was also confirmed by Ali Javanbakht, physician and medical director at UCSB Student Health. Javanbakht said, ""[This timeline] depends on people choosing to get vaccinated, what types of variants we have circulating and how quickly those variants circulate. If all goes perfectly well, it is possible to achieve herd immunity before winter 2022 but there are too many variables at play to say that with any amount of certainty.""ù These time estimates for herd immunity are difficult to pinpoint ""î largely due to the unpredictability of human behavior and the production and ongoing approval of new vaccines. We cannot safely and quickly reach collective herd immunity if the majority of people choose not to be vaccinated. Ultimately, by getting vaccinated and gaining immunity against the virus, you are taking yourself out of the pool of potential hosts for the virus ""î slowing its spread and keeping the people around you safer. Additionally, limiting the pool of potential hosts for the virus actively slows the production of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Variants: Another concern people have about the vaccine is its relative efficacy in the context of the rising number of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Importantly, we must understand that variants are a common phenomenon with viruses. Carolina Arias, a professor and researcher in the MCDB department at UCSB, noted during the Feb. 25 COVID-19 vaccines panel that ""variants are the natural evolution of the virus. As the virus replicates its genetic material, it accrues mutations with its reproduction, leading to new strains and variants.""ù SARS-CoV-2 is not unique in having variants. Rather, this is a common phenomenon that may be cause for booster shots and even annual shots into the future. Stuart Feinstein, another UCSB MCDB professor and researcher on the COVID-19 vaccines panel, noted the familiarity we have with this situation: ""We get a flu shot every year to account for new strains of the flu.""ù Despite these new variants, the Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are still effective at reducing the severity of COVID-19 infection. In fact, getting vaccinated is the first line of defense against new variants. Said Javanbakht, ""Thus far, it looks like all the variants identified will be covered by the current vaccines. So the race is on to get people vaccinated before new variants emerge that might not respond as readily to the current vaccines.""ù Testing for variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Barbara County has been limited. Our ability to understand the exact prevalence and potential impact of COVID-19 variants on vaccine efficacy is unknown, but this is an active area of research for Santa Barbara agencies. ""We have an exciting new project underway to sequence local samples that's a collaboration between Cottage, the Public Health Department, and Professor Arias' virology lab at UCSB,""ù Fitzgibbons said. Allergy concerns and delayed reactions: Many may be concerned about potential allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. For the most part, there have been relatively few reported incidences of COVID-19 vaccine reactions. Ma said, ""Common side effects right now include a sore arm, swelling at the injection site. You may get chills, muscle aches. You may develop a fever. Those effects are a sign of an activated immune system ""î or the vaccine at work. What people should pay a bit of attention to is the development of severe allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis.""ù Anaphylaxis is an extreme, life-threatening allergic reaction in the body that develops in seconds to minutes as a result of allergen exposure. At the time of the ""Science Behind COVID-19 Vaccines and Other Interventions""ù panel, about 45 million people in the U.S. had been vaccinated. Grafton said, ""If you vaccinated all of the people in Santa Barbara County ""î 450,000 people ""î two, maybe three people would experience anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions. Compare that to the 9,000 people that would experience anaphylaxis to peanut allergies or bee stings in the population.""ù Arias emphasized: ""The safety of these vaccines are under heavy scrutiny by different entities like the FDA and CDC. In the eight months since the first administered vaccines in clinical trials, we are not seeing reports of serious delayed adverse effects. It's looking like these vaccines are safer and safer as time goes by and as more people get vaccinated.""ù The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as several researchers and physicians interviewed for this piece, recommends that you check the ingredients list of all vaccines if you have any known allergies. This information for all three currently available vaccines can be accessed on the CDC website. If you have had allergic reactions to vaccines in the past, you should consult with your physician about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. If you have specific concerns about pregnancy or breastfeeding, it is again recommended that you consult with your physician before getting vaccinated. If you have a severe allergic reaction to your first dose of an mRNA vaccine, it is recommended that you do not get the second dose. Fitzgibbons said, ""The CDC website is a great place to start [to get infomed]. I would recommend going into the health care provider section of the CDC website, where there is information regarding some of the scientific studies if people want to look at the exact references themselves.""ù For more UCSB-specific COVID-19 updates, Javanbakht said, ""The campus COVID-19 webpage has good content and links to other resources.""ù In the interim before you get vaccinated: The majority of the adult population of Santa Barbara County and UCSB students are grouped in vaccination Phase 3, which targets the general population. Many have wondered when this group will have access to the vaccine. Regarding this timeline, President Biden said in his White House address on March 11th, ""I will direct all states, tribes, and territories to make all adults 18 years and older eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1.""ù For the general population that is not at risk for serious COVID-19 infections, it may be some time before the county reaches Phase 3. In the meantime, we all need to stay focused on the common goal of keeping our communities safe and healthy. As much as we'd like to plan for the day when we will be back on campus and back in crowded lecture halls, we need to stay vigilant. As of March 14, 2021, new cases in California still exceed 2,000 per day. The severity of the pandemic has not decreased despite our readiness to get to post-COVID-19 life. Social distancing and mask-wearing (maybe even ramping up to double-masking) will continue to be some of our best tools for slowing the spread of COVID-19. Most importantly, educating ourselves and others about the vaccine is essential. Our communities will not safely and quickly reach herd immunity ""î and thus life without COVID-19 restrictions ""î without vaccination.

Since summer, Save the San Marcos Foothills has campaigned in the name of protecting the West Mesa property, a controversial site ""î currently home to undeveloped open space ""î where eight homes have been approved for construction by the Chadmar Group since 2005.† The agreement stipulates that 18 million dollars are required to purchase the land alone, Chytilo said. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus Held just beyond the entrance to the West Mesa, the joint press event was the first to address the public regarding the fruits of a weeks-long negotiation between the two parties. ""We're hoping that this campaign, this effort, this opportunity to purchase these lands will provide a means to expand the preserve to include all 300 acres, and it could be managed under a common benefit with the county,""ù Marc Chytilo, an environmental attorney working with Save the San Marcos Foothills, said during the event.† Prominent speakers at the event were Chytilo, Charles Lande, the CEO of the Chadmar Group, Gregg Hart, the Santa Barbara County supervisor for the Second District, and Jordan Killebrew, the director of communications with the Santa Barbara Foundation.† The San Marcos Foothills Preserve is a 200-acre county preserve located immediately adjacent to the West Mesa property. The preserve and the West Mesa property encompass much of the last remaining native grassland in the South Coast, and it is one of the largest and most productive grasslands in Santa Barbara County, according to Channel Islands Restoration.† In addition, the land has historical ties to the Chumash Nation.† To many in the community, the boundary between the public and private land parcels are indistinguishable from one another, viewed as one and the same. Channel Islands Restoration, an organization that works to restore habitat on the Channel Islands and open space in the adjacent South Coast, has been performing habitat restoration on parts of the San Marcos Foothills Preserve since 2010. On Feb. 25, eight protesters ""î including four Chumash women ""î were arrested for blocking a bulldozer which had been brought in by contractors working with the Chadmar Group. Following that, a sit-in, carried out by various members of the Chumash community, other Indigenous activists and allies, including Seeds to Forest Defense, members of Save the San Marcos Foothills and others opposing the development, was orchestrated with the goal of preventing contractors from beginning work on the West Mesa. Simultaneously, Save the San Marcos Foothills and the Chadmar Group began engaging in legal negotiations with the aim of reaching a purchase agreement regarding the West Mesa property. Save the San Marcos Foothills was optimistic that the agreement would be reached by Monday, March 1. However, negotiations actually lasted over a week beyond that date.† The agreement stipulates that 18 million dollars are required to purchase the land, according to Chytilo. In addition, 2 million dollars need to be raised to cover the costs of the campaign and the establishment of an endowment to maintain and manage the property, according to Chytilo.† The money must be raised within a 90-day window, with the final deadline June 2, 2021, wherein all 18 million dollars are due. If 90 days have elapsed and the funds have not been procured, Save the San Marcos Foothills has agreed not to further oppose ""any final permits, approvals, or the construction,""ù according to the joint statement.† ""If we do not succeed in that 90 days, the property will be free to be developed, we will withdraw our objections to organizations that are party to this agreement and have no further objections to Mr. Lande and his team moving forward with their development,""ù Chytilo said.†† 5 million dollars must be raised towards the purchase of the property before a March 24 deadline, and 10 million dollars must be raised before a second April 13 deadline. As of March 22, 2 million dollars have been raised.† ""Because of the short time frame, the state and federal grant funding sources that would ordinarily be available for a campaign of this nature are not going to be available""ù Chytilo said.† ""We are very much looking to our community in Santa Barbara,""ù Chytilo said.† Despite the steep price tag for the land, Hart expressed hope for the campaign, noting that other properties were able to be protected as public open space in the past through community efforts. ""We've done this as a community, many times ""¶ [with] the preservation of Shoreline Park, the Douglas Family Preserve, Sperling Preserve. We have had chances like this to step forward as a community, raise dollars and protect property,""ù Hart said.†† In order to carry this out, the Foothills Forever Fund, a fiscal sponsorship fund at the Santa Barbara Foundation, has been established to collect donations from the broader community.† Many Indigenous protesters who participated in the sit-in ""î some of whom were arrested in February ""î did not speak at the press event and are not party to the purchase agreement between Save the San Marcos Foothills and the Chadmar Group.† ""All of our intentions and hopes are that we will raise the money and save the land, but it's hard to sit here and see money being transacted when the people that stole the land should be just giving it back,""ù one protester, who chose to remain anonymous, said. Some protesters who gathered at the gate leading into West Mesa expressed frustration with the press event, deeming it performative. ""[During] the press conference, they did not acknowledge the Indigenous women that got arrested on Thursday. They did not acknowledge that we've been here for 12 days holding it down in the cold right here, with nothing but E-Z Ups and sleeping bags,""ù that same protester said.† Others took issue with the removal of protest signage which formerly lined the gate marking the entrance to the West Mesa.† As one anonymous protester put it: ""We were only given 24 hours to pack up and be out of here, just so they could get a nice pretty picture-""ù† ""-with none of our signage and none of our message, [it was] all painted over and erased,""ù another anonymous protester added.† Even in the event that the money cannot be raised within the 90-day timeframe, these community members and their allies have expressed determination to continue in their efforts to ensure the land is protected and prevent the development from proceeding.† ""I don't know about everybody else but we're gonna do whatever it takes. If that means coming here and speaking in front of the gate again, you know, we're ready to do that. We're ready to do that tonight, even if it rains. We're gonna protect this land at all costs,""ù a protester, who chose to remain anonymous, said.† Correction: Previously, it was stated that Channel Islands Restoration had been performing habitat restoration on both the San Marcos Foothills Preserve and the West Mesa. Channel Islands Restoration has only been performing habitat restoration on the San Marcos Foothills Preserve, however.† Great story Sean! I'm glad the Nexus is covering this preservation effort. One slight correction: Channel Islands Restoration has only worked on the San Marcos Foothills Preserve, and not on the West Mesa.

science,"As Santa Barbara and California Pursue Decarbonization, Electrification Presents New Opportunities",30-Mar-21,6:45 PM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-30/as-santa-barbara-and-california-pursue-decarbonization-electrification-presents-new-opportunities/,"In 2017, the Santa Barbara City Council adopted a 100% renewable energy goal for the city's energy use. As part of this objective, the Energy & Climate Division, housed within the Sustainability and Resilience Department of Santa Barbara, is working to establish all-electric requirements for new construction in the county.† The University of California system has also committed to carbon neutrality. Courtesy of UCSB Sustainability Alelia Parenteau, an energy and climate manager for the City of Santa Barbara, has served as the energy representative for the city and has worked for the past 10 years to create a detailed roadmap of strategies to meet the energy goal. Over the years, this has necessitated an expansion of her team to a designated Energy & Climate Division of the City of Santa Barbara.† This year, the focus of this division has been to implement all-electric requirements for new construction, as well as crafting guidelines and pathways for workers and staff to navigate said requirements.† According to a Council Agenda Report from Jan. 12 documenting the proposed energy code amendments for new buildings, energy use in buildings is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California. According to Parenteau, lessening the carbon footprint of newer buildings offers opportunities to mitigate this and instrumentally improve energy efficiency and reliability.† The University of California system has also committed to carbon neutrality, and according to Parenteau, is positioned to provide the resources and innovation required to cut the cost of creating more sustainable sources of energy. Currently, building electrification is the most cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions. Mandating electric appliances such as electric heat pumps prove more efficient and safer than conventional natural gas methods of heating and space conditioning. In a study on residential building electrification in California, funded by the California Energy Commission, all-electric homes were estimated to ""reduce annual [greenhouse gas emissions] by 33-56 percent in 2020 and 76-88 percent in 2050""ù compared to homes fueled by natural gas. While there are encouraging advancements in making natural gases renewable, these methods remain cost-ineffective due to insufficient supplies to meet state or even county demands. With investment of time and money, renewable natural gas could prove as a tool in decarbonizing the natural gas industry. Until then, all-electric building regulation is currently the most viable and immediate solution. Parenteau said that working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the local level as well as the federal level is just as, if not more important. As such, Santa Barbara has been a leader in efforts to take action against climate change.† ""It's easy to get stuck in the mindset that Santa Barbara is so small when, actually, we can create a lasting impact on a global scale,""ù Parenteau said. ""The benefit of acting as a local government is that we can provide proof of concept by being bold and innovative. We can try out things that other governments or jurisdictions might not be as willing to try, and provide some understanding into how a program could work and what the costs and benefits could be.""ù The council collaborates extensively with local governments such as the city of Goleta, Carpenteria and North County. Parenteau said these collaborations are essential to curtailing greenhouse gas emissions on a larger scale. According to Parenteau, the Energy & Climate Division hopes to create a blooming effort in their region with their efforts, by inspiring neighboring counties to enact similar changes in building codes and new construction guidelines. As of January, 40 California jurisdictions sanctioned enhancements to building codes to either encourage or require all-electric buildings.† ""Ultimately, as you get more cities taking that stance and making that happen, [we hope that] the state will recognize the movement and create statewide policy, ultimately showing the country that this is doable. California has always been at the bleeding edge of altering emissions and gas efficiency standards, and it's local governments that keep it that way.""ù

science,"Following Widespread Die-offs, Researchers Investigate the Dangers Droughts Pose to Oaks",7-Apr-21,10:30 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-04-07/following-widespread-die-offs-researchers-investigate-the-dangers-droughts-pose-to-oaks/,"During the historic California drought from 2012 to 2015, warm temperatures and piddling precipitation took the state for a whirl unlike any other. In the 2015 wet season, the Sierra Nevada snowpack reached its lowest peak in half a millennium, while reservoirs left boats grounded and farmers with little water to tend their crops and livestock.† The canopy of a valley oak tree (Quercus lobata). Courtesy of Leander Anderegg Governor Jerry Brown's yearslong Emergency Drought Declaration instituted increased water efficiency standards to combat the new water scarcity, leading to longstanding changes in patterns of water use in California's metropolitan centers which outlived the drought itself.† Then, in the 2016-17 season, the state was hit with storm after storm, piling onto the snowpack, replenishing the reservoirs and greening a once desiccated landscape. Finally, there was widespread relief. For the survivors, that is. Another quieter, more persistent change crept across wide swathes of land both during and following the drought: over 100 million dead trees, killed by unprecedented heat and dryness.† Take the blue oak (Quercus douglasii), a drought tolerant tree common in the Sierra foothills and the Coast Ranges all across California.† ""In some parts, particularly the southern parts of this range, and on the southern foothills of the Sierra, [blue oaks] actually suffered from pretty extensive mortality due to that major, major drought,""ù Leander Anderegg, an assistant professor in the UCSB Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology said in an interview with the Nexus.† In sites north of Santa Maria, for instance, 50% to 80% of the oaks on the landscape died.† ""For a blue oak that can live hundreds of years, seeing 50% of them die off in three years is pretty concerning. And so this has raised the specter for all of us like, ""òOh, how vulnerable are oaks to climate change?' Is this the Ghost of Christmas Future that we're seeing?""ù Spurred by the mortality they were observing, Anderegg and his collaborators at UC Berkeley, the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres and the University of Bordeaux have since studied oaks across the west in North America, hoping to understand the resilience that the trees have to drought from the evolutionary and hydraulic perspective. Trees that are exceptionally dry are often killed by embolisms, which are air bubbles that can accumulate in their vascular system ""î the water transport system of trees ""î when the trees become so drought-stressed that they suck up air, blocking the flow of the water that sustains them. The researchers realized that prior research looking into the vulnerability of oaks to embolism in the lab setting had come to wildly different conclusions, some claiming that oaks were resilient to drought, others claiming that oaks were actually very vulnerable. By looking at several different lines of evidence, Anderegg and his collaborators are hoping they have brought the debate closer to some sort of consensus than before. ""It's really hard to measure the hydraulics [of oaks], because they've got these really long vessels, and that makes them really, really difficult to deal with in the lab. The whole way water moves in plants is under tension and when you cut a branch you mess with the water that was under tension,""ù Anderegg said. ""If you have these open vessels, you can get all sorts of weird answers when you're trying to make measurements in the lab.""ù The researchers used a measurement technique, the optical vulnerability method, to visualize the time frame in which an oak's xylem ""î the tissues in plants conducting water and nutrients throughout the vascular system ""î dry out and become filled with air.† They then tied this data to evolutionary and biogeographic lines of evidence.† First, they mapped their observed vulnerability to the evolutionary tree of the Western oaks and found that the most drought-resilient oaks were also all closely related evolutionarily. Then, the researchers asked themselves if these also aligned with the geographic distribution of the oaks they were studying.† In other words, did the drought-resilient oaks live in dry places? Were wet places instead host to less drought-resilient oaks? Once again, their findings using the optical vulnerability method were supported. With little exception, oaks in places like Southern California and Arizona were more drought-resilient than those found in Oregon or Washington.† This is good news, according to Anderegg, because across the board, oaks were actually fairly resilient to drought. However, a rapidly changing climate might prove an insurmountable challenge to oaks, if greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly fall in the near future. ""Clearly, [oaks are] still vulnerable because we've seen them die off in big crowds. And, you know, an organism is sort of paired to the environment that it grows in, and it's hard to say that something that is really good at dealing with drought is vulnerable or not vulnerable because that depends on where it grows,""ùAnderegg said. ""And in some senses, the drought plus fire connection is leading to [mortality] all over California. I think that the million dollar ecological question ""î or billion or trillion dollar ecological question ""î is: ""òHow much torque can we put on California's ecosystems before you start having type conversions and the vegetation of a place fundamentally changes?'""ù

science,"To ‚""Decolonize‚""ù the Social Sciences, Cross-Cultural Research Must Be More Equitable, Researchers Say",11-Apr-21,11:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-04-11/to-decolonize-the-social-sciences-cross-cultural-research-must-be-more-equitable-researchers-say/,"For decades, antiquated research practices enshrined the behavior of undergraduate students, or even just the W.E.I.R.D. ""î those in countries who are western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic ""î as the standard of human behavior.† A flat tire being replaced in the midst of fieldwork in Mwanza, Tanzania. Courtesy of David Lawson Nowadays, however, the sun has set on such a mentality.† Variation in behavior based on circumstance and setting, as the social sciences now understand, is commonplace and important to take into account. Thus, seeking broader and more diverse samples to better understand human behavior, the social sciences, particularly anthropology and psychology, have sought data from more diverse backgrounds in recent years.† Cross-cultural research† ""î as it is called ""î and the data obtained from such research, has thus exploded in popularity and become, as David Lawson, a professor of anthropology at UC Santa Barbara said, a ""commodity""ù in the social sciences.† ""Researchers across the social sciences are increasingly interested in cross-cultural research, often requiring collecting data in others countries,""ù Lawson said. Lawson has collaborated with local researchers at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mwanza, Tanzania, for over 10 years. However, as cross-cultural research has become more commonplace, and more collaboration between local and stateside ""î or European ""î academics has taken place, those in relatively lower income countries find themselves locked out of the processes and infrastructure needed to obtain authorship or other types of compensation for the essential work that they do.†† At times it can lead to an environment which is extractive, or even colonial, Lawson said.† Lawson and his colleagues, including Mark Urassa and Joyce Wamoyi at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mwanza, Tanzania, Eshetu Gurmu at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia, Purnima Madhivanan at the Public Health Research Institute of India and Caitlyn Placek at Ball State University in Indiana, have brought forth recommendations† intending to start a conversation and hopefully spur positive changes when it comes to this problem, which remains unaddressed and rarely spoken of in academia.† ""We can take a range of proactive actions, including being very clear that current fieldwork practices are often in need of improvement. And that's a conversation that might be difficult to have with your advisor or with your colleagues at an early stage, but hopefully a comment like this encourages that dialogue,""ù Lawson said.† On the institutional level, oftentimes the infrastructure and pipelines for research funding, for instance, serve as an obstacle to the proper incorporation of local collaborators and researchers.† ""So for example, a graduate student might want to go and do fieldwork in another country, but they wouldn't necessarily be encouraged to seek out local experts before visiting a study community. They maybe would just get ethical approval and then go to that community and work directly with them, which circumvents local institutions and may not allow opportunities to share grant funding,""ù Lawson said.† Among their recommendations to mend this unequal relationship include campaigning funders to ensure that grant sharing between institutions in higher and lower-middle income countries is easier and more equitable, embracing open-access publishing, developing and enforcing ethical review procedures, rewarding those who take the time and effort to cultivate equitable collaborations, and sharing unused equipment with lower-middle income country partners, among many others.† Urassa, a longtime colleague of Lawson and the lead author of the perspective piece, also noted the changes which local researchers and institutions must take in lockstep with American and European institutions. ""It was important to us to recognize that effort is needed on both sides,""ù Urassa said. ""Visiting researchers must pay fairly for the skilled labor of local researchers and respect the jurisdiction of national institutions. Lower income countries can also do more to take advantage of existing opportunities for collaboration and invest in the career aspirations of our junior social scientists as future research leaders.""ù† However, Lawson is still hopeful and hopes that his colleagues see their perspective piece as an ultimately positive and optimistic one.† ""There are ""¶ complications with anthropological research because we often do work with very isolated, marginalized groups. Maybe there's tensions between that group and national governments, and so on,""ù Lawson said. ""It can be difficult, but we can set intentions, And we can think about getting around those problems. After all anthropologists are meant to be experts in cultural diversity and different perspectives. We should be able to handle that kind of challenge.""ù

The scholarship covers full tuition, a stipend, travel costs and an opportunity to apply for a $2000 special research grant, according to the Churchill Scholarship website. Churchill College is the only college at Cambridge focused on S.T.E.M. subjects. Courtesy of Alec Cao Cao will work with Zoran Hadzibabic, a professor of physics in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge studying ultracold quantum gases.† ""[Hadzibabic] is a really, really respected guy. I was immediately blown away by the level of creativity he showed in our first conversation,""ù Cao said. This year, Cao is the only recipient of the highly-selective scholarship from the UC system ""ìand only the third UCSB student ever.† †""It's not a common thing to get and it really speaks well of [Cao's] achievements as an undergrad that he got this. I mean, he's turning down other fellowships to take this on. It's definitely a special thing,""ù David Weld, a professor of physics at UCSB who has worked extensively with Cao, said.† Cao began participating in research with Weld during the winter of his freshman year. Weld and Cao had met while Cao was still in high school. Weld actually encouraged Cao to apply to UCSB's College of Creative Studies. In Weld's lab, Cao has been running quantum gas experiments, examining what happens to systems that are classically chaotic when they become quantum mechanical. Cao and Max Prichard, another undergraduate in the Weld Lab, currently have the expertise to carry out these experiments on their own, working with incredibly complicated and technically demanding equipment, according to Weld. ""Generally, I think, for the physical concepts that we've been studying in the lab, [we're asking] how can we control the properties of quantum particles by explicitly modulating or changing some parameters as a function of time in a periodic repeated way,""ù Cao said.† ""And we can do this basically by taking this mass of really low temperature atoms, and shining a laser light onto them.

science,UCSB Lecturer Partners with CEC in Advocacy of Sustainable Living,23-Apr-21,10:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-04-23/ucsb-lecturer-partners-with-cec-in-advocacy-of-sustainable-living/,"As part of the Community Environmental Council's Earth Day Festival ""î held virtually this year as a COVID-19 precaution ""î Deborah Williams, a lecturer in the Department of Environmental Studies at UCSB, has partnered with the organization to document 21 measures one can take to reduce their waste and consumption. The campaign, known as Earth Day Every Day, represents the culmination of five years of accumulated lifestyle changes carried out by Williams and her husband in their own personal quest to become more sustainable.†† One commitment calls on one to eat more sustainably by avoiding beef and lamb. Courtesy of Deborah Williams Williams was first inspired to reflect and make such changes herself following the Sherpa Fire, which burned in 2016. The fire scorched thousands of acres in the Santa Ynez Mountains above Santa Barbara and Goleta from mid-June going into July, darkening the skies with a cloud of haze and causing a rain of ash down on the South Coast.† ""We were looking out the window at our little backyard watching the ash accumulate on our picnic table,""ù Williams said. ""At that point I said to my husband. We've got to everything ""î on a personal level ""î that we can do to minimize our carbon footprint.""ù† In the immediate aftermath of the fire, the two proceeded to compile a list of ten commitments they would research and implement into their daily life in the name of sustainability. This original list of ten eventually expanded into 21 published as part of Earth Day Every Day. The commitments include such practices as a commitment to eliminate unnecessary paper use, avoid single-use cleaning products and synthetic pesticides, and better insulate one's living spaces to save electricity.† The sequence of commitments, meanwhile, reflects a progression from lifestyle changes which have little to no monetary cost, such as going paperless, to ones which may take some financial investment on the part of the individual, such as investing in a low-flow showerhead.†††† However, Williams also had her undergraduate students at UCSB in mind while writing the list. Because of this, many of the commitments have alternate strategies outlined for those who, for example, cannot put solar panels on their property or afford to outright purchase an electric vehicle.†† ""I did want to ensure that for each commitment there was an action that everyone could take ""¶ I made no-cost or very low-cost alternative actions for every commitment because, fundamentally, I believe that we should do our commitments at whatever level we're able to do,""ù Williams said. For instance, those hoping to advance solar in their workplace or the broader community are directed to a number of resources and initiatives. For renters who are bold enough to urge their landlords to install solar, the website directs them to helpful talking points they can use, such as financial incentives like tax credits, tax exemptions and solar financing options.††† In addition, while Williams acknowledged that the commitments were definitely an adjustment for her and her husband, many of them she has found enrich her life and are less of a personal sacrifice than a new and more conscientious way of doing things.† ""Let's look at [2: Lower the Paper Flow]. What's the win-win associated with this? Obviously, you're lowering your carbon footprint and helping save trees. At the same time you are reducing the waste that you generate,""ù Williams said.† ""But you're also saving the psychic frustration of getting all that junk mail. You're also potentially helping protect your credit, because you can opt out of credit and insurance card solicitations that might fall into the wrong hands. So, this is another example of doing the right thing for the environment, but also achieving other benefits.""ù However, the penultimate commitment on the list is a bit different from the others. The commitment implores people in the community to engage by helping environmental organizations through volunteerism and advocacy, such as testimony and written comments.† According to Williams, who has worked to advance environmental protections on the local, state and federal levels for decades (even as a presidential appointee) such actions are crucial in enacting lasting change, preserving valuable resources and protecting our natural heritage.† ""It is so important for us to communicate our commitment to our planet, our nation, our state and our communities, so that decision makers devote the time and energy to do what needs to be done to address this crisis.""ù

""This was a way to do something fun and special for them, and keep the larger vision of opportunity in science alive for the kids.""ù Graduate student and program coordinator Michael Zimet led the effort to shift to an online learning format. The most important aspect of science education for elementary schoolers is hands-on science demonstrations, he said. So, figuring out how to bring the science to life in a virtual setting was the biggest challenge.† Another presenter, Molly Kaplan, carrying out a presentation on sound.

""So we did that two ways: with traditional videos and the development of home experiments that would guide students step-by-step, like using balloons to demonstrate static electricity.""ù Because of this new part of the program, Zimet said they have been able to create a remote library of content that is accessible after or before online events. Carlson added that because of the changes to the program to address the pandemic, interactions with students have been augmented, rather than diluted.† ""I think Science Nights are a great way to reach a lot of people, but the Zoom calls with 20 or so students, where we have a more intimate quiz format where they just ask us questions is also of great value that increases our radius,""ù Carlson said.† Zimet added that the transmission of excitement and joy for science can be more personal in a classroom setting, and an online format allows for those connections. Carlson attributes the success and growth of the program to the collaboration between those involved ""î graduate and undergraduate students from various disciplines such as English, earth science, math or chemistry. This diversity, she said, allowed for innovation and perspective required to successfully move the Physics Circus online.† ""It's been wonderful to support the creativity of the student volunteers,""ù Zimet said, ""and the online demos have been a great addition that I think will persist, even when we go back to in-person learning.""ù

science,Forks in the Road Emerge in India‚'s Quest to Expand Renewables,25-Apr-21,11:56 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-04-25/forks-in-the-road-emerge-in-indias-quest-to-expand-renewables/,"As economies around the world become increasingly ambitious in accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels and other forms of nonrenewable energy, India ""î the world's second most populous country and the fifth largest economy in the world by GDP ""î has emerged as a global leader in the expansion of renewables.† For India, a wind power-majority system may have the lowest carbon mitigation costs. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons But there is still a long, long road ahead. Despite its incredible gains in renewables, the Indian energy mix is dominated by pollutant-laden coal. As part of the country's decarbonization commitments, the country believes it can install more than 400 gigawatts of wind and solar generation by the year 2030, an incredible undertaking.† ""Just to give you a comparative number, the total installed capacity of all kinds of generation sources in California is about [80] gigawatts,""ù Ranjit Deshmukh, a professor in the environmental studies department at UCSB, said.† But what is the best path to take to achieve this? India plans to have more than two-thirds of its new renewable capacity derived from solar photovoltaics, with the remainder coming from wind energy. Deshmukh, however, has recently conducted research which runs contrary to this policy.† Deshmukh has been researching energy policy in the Indian subcontinent for more than a decade, starting with his work for the Prayas Energy Group researching solar policy. Later, Deshmukh conducted research as a PhD student at UC Berkeley before becoming a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he eventually transitioned to a faculty scientist position.† This work has continued as Deshmukh has moved to UCSB, with the researcher specifically focusing on low-carbon electricity system planning and how to plan for and prioritize wind and solar in the energy mix.† His most recent work, published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is a product five years in the making. It aims to chart the least costly path toward India's proposed new renewable capacity while taking into account existing infrastructure, patterns of land use, the expected availability of wind and solar resources, and the social and economic consequences associated with wind and solar development.† In order to carry out this analysis, Deshmukh and his collaborators made use of a multitude of spatial datasets which the team superimposed on top of each other. These included datasets on wind speed, solar radiation, land use, the delineation between urban and rural areas as well as bodies of water, roads and transmission substations.† ""You want to incentivize development closer to transmission infrastructure so you minimize the length of your transmission lines,""ù Deshmukh explained. Meanwhile, solar would be undesirable to put on agricultural land, because it would compete with food production, Deshmukh continued.† Through this spatial analysis, Deshmukh and his collaborators found that India's planned emphasis on solar power might not be ideal. Instead, a wind power-majority system appears to be the one with the lowest carbon mitigation costs.† This largely has to do with the nature of solar power, as well as India's specific weather patterns which make wind energy more salient, according to Deshmukh.† Solar power is coincident with the rising and falling of the sun. However, the evening, when solar power is largely unavailable, is still a period of substantial energy consumption. The burden of electricity generation falls on the conventional, polluting sources. ""You can't shut coal plants down [during the day], because it is very difficult to start and stop coal-fired power plants on short notice, even if you knew exactly when to stop it. You can't just stop it for three or four hours,""ù Deshmukh said. ""Now some plants can do it with some retrofits, but a lot of them, especially the existing ones cannot.""ù Meanwhile, wind power availability in India is instead influenced largely by seasonality.† ""During June, July and August, the wind blows fairly continuously in many areas. You can actually allow these coal-fired power plants to shut down. So even if wind is really seasonal and solar is less seasonal, because of the nature of the wind patterns compared to solar, we saw more wind generation being absorbed by the electrical grid,""ù Deshmukh said.† However, advances in battery storage add nuance to this point, Deshmukh said. As the cost of storage decreases, the share of solar in the mix can become larger on account of this because it is no longer tethered to the daylight hours. On a related note, renewables in general will only be able to completely displace conventional generation with the use of affordable battery storage, Deshmukh said, because during September, October and November, the lack of wind during peak demand following sunset would be problematic without it. ""Battery storage can not only just help solar, but it can also help avoid conventional generation capacity, because they will be the ones that will be meeting that demand. So we really hope that battery costs come down significantly,""ù Deshmukh said. Correction: The total installed capacity of all generation sources in California is 80 gigawatts, not 60 to 70. In addition, Deshmukh was originally stated to have been a faculty scientist and a postdoctoral researcher simultaneously. Instead, Deshmukh was originally a postdoctoral researcher and later transitioned into a faculty scientist.† Comments are closed.

Food webs typically illustrate any consumer-resource relationships and how biomass is transferred through a particular system. While the kelp ecosystem is known for being rich in species, many people don't recognize the full extent of its biodiversity.†Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Their recent publication illuminates the complex connections between organisms in the kelp forest ecosystems by including more parasites and small invertebrates. This also created a higher resolution of species interactions than past webs.† Their research also extends to more indirect relationships between organisms that are further apart in the food web. ""Often we know what the direct interactions would be with a species but we don't know all the rippling effects,""ù Morton explained. ""If I eat this one species that could affect the predators of that species or that species' prey, those are all the indirect effects.""ù† Morton said these indirect interactions shed light on the large-scale ecological shifts for the kelp forests. The relatively long eight-year length of the project was partially due to the high volume of data being compiled. Morton said they drew some data from past webs while also filling in the gaps through field sampling. For the field samples, they collected fish and invertebrates to study their tissues under microscopes and search for parasites. Once the parasites were found, they created a photographic record of each one. They were then able to piece together more parts of the web with the more detailed record of parasites and small free-living invertebrates.† According to Morton, one of the main challenges they encountered was mapping precise connections between organisms while not getting swept away in the minute details of the cycle. Morton explained how she would sometimes spend copious amounts of time trying to find one specific record or piece of data. She described this process as ""tracing these little trails in the literature.""ù The immensity of information they needed to compile made it difficult to stay focused on the big picture while also maintaining accuracy.† ""I have to be focused on the details but not so focused on the details that I never get it done,""ù Morton explained. While they weren't able to focus on too many small details for this project, it opened up new questions that could inspire future research.† A graph of a kelp forest food web with parasites (a) and without (b). Courtesy of Dana Morton One of the new questions came from an undergraduate on her team. Christiana Antonino noticed a marine isopod that acts similarly to a termite within the kelp. This isopod, also known as kelp gribble (Limnoria algarum), burrows tunnels through the kelp which then house their colonies of offspring. According to Morton, these isopods have been observed in different species of algae but never in kelp before. A better understanding of these small invertebrates could provide more information on how they affect kelp ecosystems. Morton described this as ""an example of a rabbit hole where you find something cool but it takes you on a tangent from the overall project.""ù† Morton hopes that the higher resolution of this food web will aid in efficiency and clarity for future research. ""One of the big unknowns when you are looking at how a species is going to interact in the system is what [the] indirect effects will be,""ù she explained. Morton emphasized that it will now be easier to see how each organism is indirectly affecting the community as a whole.† She further explained that indirect relationships ""can be kind of overwhelming to study, but now that we have the food web, you could look to see what all those potential interactions might be.""ù Morton said this food web will also help exemplify the immense diversity found in kelp forests. While the kelp ecosystem is known for being rich in species, many people don't recognize the full extent of it. A visual representation of these species and systems will expand upon previous understanding of the ecological diversity.† Comments are closed.

A UC Santa Barbara researcher created a framework connecting how we perceive others in a virtual setting to why this exhaustion happens.† Nadler first started this research while working in virtual writing centers. Courtesy of Micro Biz Mag Robby Nadler, the director of UCSB's Academic, Professional and Technical Graduate Writing Development Program, theorizes that exhaustion comes from the inability to distinguish between person, background and technology when it comes to computer-mediated communication (CMC). The compression of our identity through audiovisual technology is what Nadler calls our ""third skin.""ù† Nadler first started this research in his years working in virtual writing centers, when it became clear to him that there were big differences in how people behaved in these settings when compared to face-to-face interactions. The pandemic gave him an opportunity to model what he has been thinking about and to theorize beyond the anecdotal.† To fully understand CMC exhaustion, we have to start off by breaking down what ""skins""ù are. First skin refers to the literal skin on your body. Nadler says, ""If you look at a person you actually know quite a bit of information. You can tell someone's age, just by looking at their body, you can look at them in sense of ability, gender, race, all these components can be in there.""ù Human and animal appearances code information about how we are perceived and the assumptions we make about others. Theorized by fashion studies, second skins describe how clothing functions as a way of creating identity.† Your first and second skins are yours; they are connected to you. Space, on the other hand, is not a skin in itself. ""Anyone can stand in a house or in the background,""ù explains Nadler. ""Anyone can occupy it.""ù However, when you're in a Zoom session, this is where ""things get funky with ""òZoom fatigue.'""ù† He uses the example of a movie score to model what's going on with Zoom. When we watch a movie, we can hear the score of the film, but the characters don't. We can make that distinction between what is perceived by us as the audience and what is perceived by the characters.† When we move to Zoom, we suddenly lose the ability to make this distinction. When a leaf blower goes off in the background, to you, it can easily be drowned out as background noise. But to someone interacting with you on Zoom, that leaf blower ""î background noise""î is indistinguishable from who you are. Nadler says, ""So this third skin is this process in which we take on all these other elements that people associate us with, even though we wouldn't do that in face-to-face interaction.""ù Using this theory of ""third skins,""ù he provides a framework for understanding why adding audio and visual components to our virtual interactions can lead to exhaustion. There is a confusing amount of stimuli that the perceiver cannot code as relevant or irrelevant. Attempting to engage in computer-mediated interactions thus requires more from us than via face-to-face.† So how can we move forward in dealing with our ""Zoom fatigue?""ù One recommendation Nadler makes is sectioning off physical spaces that are meant for work and for your personal life or using Zoom only for work. Regarding productivity, he says that turning off your video, at least in a writing center context, has been shown to help for a number of reasons. You stop focusing on your appearance and how you look, lessening the worry of what people think of you and allowing you to pay more attention to the ideas being presented. Ultimately, Nadler wants us to be transparent with each other when it comes down to how we're feeling.† ""Communicate these feelings. As someone who teaches on campus with students and works with them and who experiences this exhaustion, too, I think a lot of us, we wink and nod like, ""òYeah, Zoom fatigue,'""ù Nadler said. ""But we don't actually say to professors, ""òHey, is it okay to turn my camera off? I am just really exhausted today Zoom fatigue wise, and it would just really help me if I could concentrate on the lecture.'""ù† Whether it be through emoji reactions or the chat function, creating ways to tether each other to the virtual learning environment is crucial in mitigating exhaustion and affirming both teachers and students that they are truly being heard.† Comments are closed.

science,Star Tunicate‚'s Vascular System Sheds Light on Future Treatments for Aging-Associated Diseases,19-May-21,3:00 PM,['Camilla Zhou'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-05-19/star-tunicates-vascular-system-sheds-light-on-future-treatments-for-aging-associated-diseases/,"Aging seems to be a terrifying process for most of us ""î all kinds of diseases come along with it.† Botryllus schlosseri, or the star tunicate, has a open vascular system. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Many humans are not satisfied with their healthspan, the period of life one spends in good health. Aging-associated diseases rob our vitality and constrain us from living as we were young. ""When you are 60, [you] live until 80 and then, for 20 years, [you get] progressively unhealthy. We'd love to change your healthspan.""ù said Anthony De Tomaso, a professor in the Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology department at UC Santa Barbara, who is leading a team in studying aging in the vascular system. True to De Tomaso's words,† most people would wish for a longer healthspan, to live like a 60-year-old in their 80s, with a comparable quality of life. People step closer to acquiring serious diseases in the aging process. One person dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. alone ""î most of whom are older than age 75. Even when it isn't besieged by disease, the worn-out vascular system decreases in flexibility and people also have reduced mobility. For example, they may not be able to play high intensity sports. Besides vascular diseases, elders also have a higher probability of acquiring cancer. However, De Tomaso and his team have gained results through their research that may enlighten treatments toward these diseases by studying the vascular system of a model organism in research published in Frontiers.† They were creative when choosing which organism to study vessels in. Instead of some commonly used models such as mice or worms, they worked on Botryllus schlosseri, a type of tunicate that has its vascular system growing outside of its body. The accessibility of its vascular cells enabled researchers to cut out pieces of vessels, watch how the vessels regrow or regress in real time and learn which genes are expressed at a particular stage using DNA (or mRNA) sequencing methods. One of the questions they asked was how an old-appearing blood vessel cell is different from a young-appearing cell. The answer was, as they age, cells form narrower vessels that only allow blood to flow through slowly. When the flow speed reaches the lower threshold, aging stops and death overtakes the organism. The following question rose immediately after: How does genetics affect the aging process? After working closely with these model organisms, researchers confirmed that gene expression related to cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM) functions changed a lot as they age. The cytoskeleton is analogous to our skeleton, but on a much smaller scale: They are supporting the cells from within. The ECM is a 3D network that supports its surrounding cells externally. When the cytoskeleton and ECM don't work as well due to aging, the vessel cells have a more disorganized structure and become stiffened. Although they express different genes, old cells and young cells don't differ in their cytoskeleton and ECM DNA sequences. Instead, this differential expression results from epigenetic changes, which are modifications in gene expression that don't involve changes in the DNA sequences themselves, such as differences in how proteins interact with a DNA strand. For example, some proteins that normally repress the expression of a gene unique to young cells may be produced near the DNA strand in a much higher concentration than before, causing that gene to become muted, which could lead to cellular aging. This key finding, that old and young cells differ in their epigenetic expressions, was proved by an ablation experiment, in which researchers cut a piece of the blood vessels from both the young and the old B. schlosseri and observed whether the vessels would regrow. To their surprise, both the old and the young organisms regenerated vessels, but the old ones were only able to regenerate old-looking cells, which formed narrow vessels. It seems like aging doesn't inhibit a vessel's regenerating ability, but it does determine what the regenerated cells look like. Although the study results are not applicable in real life currently, they allow us to better understand how the aging process brings differences for cells at different ages, according to De Tomaso. Recognizing the difference between the desired outcome, which is the young cell, and the target, the old cell, is the first important step toward understanding how to possibly rejuvenate our old vessels. Besides providing implications for future studies on vascular diseases, these results may also shed light on cancer treatment.† Researchers treated B. schlosseri with a type of cancer-suppressing drug called BAPN, which works to inhibit new vessel growth in tumors.† In response to BAPN, young blood vessel cells commit suicide but old cells don't. That immediately caught researchers' attention because the reaction of the young cells is a desired outcome when tackling a tumor.† As a tumor also needs nutrients, it tricks blood vessels to grow toward itself and serve as a food delivery pipe. If researchers can trick a tumor into behaving like B. schlosseri and cause newly formed blood vessels to retreat from the tumor in a controlled manner without damaging other tissues, they could come closer to developing cures for a variety of cancers.†

Mark Turiansky, a graduate student who is part of a research group headed by materials professor Chris G. Van de Walle, says that to ensure this growth, the efficiency by which solar energy is collected must be maximized. Materials, namely the use of perovskite crystals in solar cells, are an essential component of that goal.† A photo of perovskite. Courtesy of Xie Zhang Van de Walle's group has spent many years applying computational techniques to study different materials for collecting solar energy. Dr. Xie Zhang, a postdoctoral researcher in the group, led this project. Specifically, they've studied recombination processes in semiconductors, where they analyze what happens to an excited electron in the semiconductor to see if it produces light or heat. In this instance, they sought to optimize the production of light in a solar cell, while minimizing the production of heat. The material they focused on was hybrid perovskites, consisting of the perovskite crystal itself as well as the incorporation of inorganic atoms. ""These hybrid perovskites have attracted a lot of attention because they are very low-cost to synthesize, and more importantly, they've been used to create solar cells with remarkable efficiencies,""ù Turiansky said. ""They're even rivaling the efficiency of silicon-based solar cells, which are the current state of the art.""ù With this knowledge of the material's potential, the team applied their methodologies to build a foundation and understand the perovskite itself, as well as its use. Rather than running experiments in a lab, the team performed computational research, running calculations using supercomputing resources provided by the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center.† Turiansky said their work was also from ""first principles,""ù meaning that they did not fit to experiment ""î rather, they derived their numbers by solving the quantum mechanical equations that describe how electrons behave in materials.† In their research, the group found defects that were limiting the efficiency of the solar cells. Experimentally, they could not find what those defects were. So, they used calculations to study candidate defects that could explain what had been seen.† ""We came across something novel, a hydrogen vacancy,""ù Turiansky said. ""Most studies treat the organic molecule as an inseparable unit, but we found that it's very possible to break off a hydrogen atom [from] these molecules.""ù Their calculations quantitatively showed that this vacancy, according to Turiansky, explained the experimental observations and was a major source of efficiency loss. They also surveyed a second hybrid perovskite with formamidinium compounds and found that hydrogen vacancies were less problematic in that material. Thus, they found that alloying the perovskite with formamidinium rather than the original methylammonium increased the efficiency of hybrid-perovskite solar cells. ""This is a major highlight of our work,""ù Turiansky said. ""Not only can we interpret and explain experimental observations, but we can predict and find new promising research directions using our calculations.""ù The Van de Walle group's work is, Turiansky said, a very important step toward increasing the efficiency of solar cell devices. Their results suggest modifying synthesis conditions to minimize hydrogen loss by alloying the perovskite with materials not prone to hydrogen vacancy formation, like formamidinium is.† ""With this discovery, hybrid perovskite solar cells may very well become the leading low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell material,""ù Turiansky said. ""It may not be long before people are putting hybrid-perovskite-based solar cells on their roofs.""ù

Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons They do this by using both complex mathematical climate modeling and proxies found throughout Earth ""î like ice cores ""î to reconstruct paleoclimates found in Earth's past. ""I think it is very valuable, societally, to understand climate change, climate variability and what drives this variability. Paleoclimate studies contribute significantly to this understanding,""ù Syee Weldeab, a professor in the Earth Science department at UC Santa Barbara who studies paleoclimate, said. Weldeab has sought to better understand the paleoclimate of various places worldwide, including Central Asia, the Eastern Tropical Atlantic and the Bay of Bengal, using marine sediments and cave deposits, like stalagmites, as climate archives. Along this vein, Weldeab, in collaboration with other researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Auburn University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, University of Massachusetts Amherst and UNAM Campus Juriquilla, has worked to piece together data to better understand how the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula's precipitation patterns have changed during the mid-Holocene, roughly 5.2 to 5.7 thousand years ago, to the late-Holocene era, immediately before the industrial revolution. Such information is important because rainfall patterns have profound implications for whether or not a landscape is hospitable for human beings.† ""If you have a wet climate, and it is not subject to large-scale frequent dry-and-wet cycles, then you also have a denser vegetation cover. In addition, agricultural activity is less affected by drought. That makes it more stable and a more conducive environment for human beings,""ù Weldeab said. The Yucat√°n Peninsula is a relatively flat low-lying landmass made almost entirely of limestone that extends northeast from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec ""î the landmark that separates Central America from the rest of the North American continent to the Caribbean Sea. The Yucat√°n is home to a mixture of tropical wet and dry forests. Its limestone landscape results in karst formations, like water sinkholes ""î otherwise known as cenotes ""î and caves. For the Maya, who have inhabited the Yucat√°n for millennia, such formations have served to harbor life-sustaining water resources in a landscape where no major rivers exist and pronounced dry seasons leave the region periodically parched.† These limited surface water resources also leave the region vulnerable to extended periods of multi-year drought, which occasionally plague the region and have been linked to the decline of Maya civilization.† But the Yucat√°n didn't always exhibit the rainfall patterns that it does today. In fact, thousands of years ago, during the mid-Holocene, the Yucat√°n was a wetter place with less frequent dry periods and more stable rainfall than either the late-Holocene or the present day, according to the findings of† Weldeab and his collaborators. The team examined the isotope composition of stalagmites, mounds of mineral deposits found on the floors of caves that grow upward as water drips from cave ceilings. As rainfall or other precipitation occurs above a cave, some of this water percolates through rock and is deposited onto stalagmites, which immortalize the chemistry of this water in their layers.† Weldeab next to a stalagmite under study in another field site in Central Asia. Courtesy of Syee Weldeab Stalagmites and other related cave formations preserve a treasure trove of historical precipitation information, gleaned by looking at the isotope composition of oxygen present within the layers of the formation.† Weldeab said that they focused on the ratio of two oxygen isotopes: Oxygen-18 and Oxygen-16. ""The ratio between those two isotopes reflects mainly two factors. One, how much it's raining over the cave, and where the moisture is coming from which precipitates over the cave,""ù Weldeab said.† ""We cannot go back in time and measure precipitation. But the environmental change ""î in what we call hydroclimate or the climate around precipitation ""î is basically manifested into the stalagmite. And by going and looking at the isotope composition of the stalagmite, we can make inferences about changes in precipitation in the past.""ù Weldeab's collaborators, led by Mart√≠n Medina-Elizalde with the University of Massachusetts Amherst, unearthed a meter-long stalagmite dated to 5.2 to 5.7 thousand years ago from R√≠o Secreto, a cave system near Playa del Carmen in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. They compared this stalagmite to one unearthed in the same cave dated to the late-Holocene to reach a verdict regarding the past hydroclimate of the northern Yucat√°n, and found that the mid-Holocene had a wetter, more stable hydroclimate than the late-Holocene and the present.† However, according to Weldeab, it is important not to conflate the reconstructed past climate of the Yucat√°n with potential future climates influenced by anthropogenic climate change.† ""We know for instance that during the mid-Holocene in the Yucat√°n, the summer was warmer than today. But the warmer summer [than today] was caused by changes in the Sun and Earth's configuration. So when we look at a warming climate due to greenhouse gas increase, it's not only a warming during the† summer but also a warming winter,""ù Weldeab said. This has a significant impact on the rainfall patterns that result from changes in average temperature.† ""You can learn fundamental climate behavior by studying paleoclimate like we did. You can also learn about the fundamental variability of climate and apply that knowledge to think about future climate. But it's not transferable one to one,""ù Weldeab said.†

science,"Unlearning the ‚""In-group Versus Out-group‚""ù Instinct",23-May-21,10:25 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-05-23/unlearning-the-in-group-versus-out-group-instinct/,"By the age of two, the brain of a child is almost three-quarters the size of an adult's. However, within this brain exists notable distinctions between the growing and grown mind.† Courtesy of Zoe Liberman While research has shown that humans have remarkably malleable, or neuroplastic, brains compared to other animals ""î even into adulthood ""î early childhood is when the human brain is most malleable, and these formative years of neuronal growth set the stage for the future in big ways.† Early childhood provides a foundation for future health, behavior and learning. Stress, trauma, speaking, play and reading all have outsized, lifelong impacts when they occur in early childhood.† Even our conception of the world, such as who is similar to us and who is different, has a foundation in our childhood. Learning to distinguish people from one another and recognize differences is an important skill, but this categorical thinking also leads children to stereotype and look at people of the same race or background with potentially damaging assumptions. In response to this, Zoe Liberman, a professor with the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at UC Santa Barbara, has recently won a National Science Foundation (NSF) Early CAREER award to examine how children might be steered to avoid stereotyping and what role parental care plays in this.† As† an undergraduate, Liberman worked in the Infant Cognition Center at Yale, assisting in studies examining the early inkling of moral reasoning. Later, Liberman became interested in social categorization, particularly with regards to early children. ""I learned how early children start to form groups of ""òus' and ""òthem' and show favoritism towards their own groups. Studying the early development of categorization can help us determine whether there are ways to mitigate bias,""ù Liberman said in an email with the Nexus.† Psychologists have more broadly become interested in how parents educate children about groups. Research has shown, for instance, that white parents have a tendency to adopt a ""colorblind""ù ideology and avoid mentioning race, hoping that children will simply remain unaware of differences and group divisions.† But children intuitively notice these differences, regardless of whether or not adults speak of them.† Because of this,† ""it is probably better to talk openly about different groups and provide explanations that will help children understand the structure of their social world,""ù Liberman said.† Going beyond this, there is data to suggest that even seemingly innocuous statements in generic speech ""î such as saying boys like soccer ""î lead children to extrapolate and draw conclusions. After all, if a child hears that boys like soccer, what can they be led to assume about girls? ""[A] recent study found that children can even use this type of talk to learn something about unmentioned groups ""î maybe girls don't like soccer,""ù Liberman said.† Along this vein, Liberman has been conducting research with the hope of understanding how parents can raise their children to ensure they don't fall into the trap of tribalism and stereotyping. With her NSF Early CAREER funding, Liberman will examine how children's experiences with diversity might dampen their propensity to stereotype. Will children who grow up with more diverse social environments, for instance, think about groups and social categorization in less absolute terms than other children?† Liberman and her collaborators, with this goal in mind, will measure the diversity of children's neighborhoods using Census data and pair this with data about the diversity of children's social networks, obtained from information parents provide about the people that their child spends time with. These will be weighed in terms of both diversity of race and language.† In her prior work, Liberman has seen inklings to suggest that exposure to diversity does, in fact, make children less inclined to stereotype.† Research looking at infants found that they expect people who speak the same language to be similar and, specifically, to have similar food preferences as them ""î an assumption they didn't have regarding those who speak different languages. This was not the case with bilingual infants.† ""Interestingly, bilingual infants expected people to like the same foods even if they spoke different languages, suggesting that experiences growing up hearing more languages made babies less reliant on language as an indicator of social group,""ù Liberman said. ""My new projects extend on this work by studying children in addition to infants, studying race in addition to language, and expanding the definition of diversity beyond bilingualism.""ù† Liberman's new project will involve asking children generalization questions and seeing how they respond depending on the diversity of their surroundings in daily life.† For instance, suppose a child is shown and given a description of both a Spanish speaker and an English speaker, and then later shown another English speaker without being given a description of this person. How does the child's understanding of the first two speakers lead them to make an assumption about the new English speaker and what they are like?† ""If children are [paying attention] to group membership, then they may be more likely to pick the match (the other English speaker). Our predictions are that children who are exposed to more diversity may be less likely to always choose matches,""ù Liberman said.† If this hypothesis holds true, Liberman may be able to use it to inform parents of how diversity can be used to reduce prejudice in their child as they mature and make sense of the world around them.†† ""[Perhaps] it is possible that exposing children to multiple languages can have benefits not only for language learning, but also for reducing social attention towards race,""ù Liberman said.

A flock of sheep. Kabsik Park / flickr And within these habitats are presumed to be a wealth of natural products useful for their pharmaceutical, therapeutic and antimicrobial potential. These are the subjects of intense interest and study.†† But biodiversity is a descriptor that fits more settings than just the megadiverse regions found in the tropics. The California floristic province, for instance, where Isla Vista is found, stretches from Baja California to Southern Oregon and is the home of some 3,400 taxa of endemic plants. We can even go more local than that, however. Look within individual animals ""î the kind one can find at a petting zoo, like sheep, goats and horses ""î and a whole world of microbial diversity opens up. Consider microbiomes: the totality of microbiota living on and within vertebrates.† ""We know that there are natural products that give us highly valuable medicines and therapeutics that are sourced from really exotic environments,""ù Candice Swift, a researcher at the UC Santa Barbara Department of Chemical Engineering, said. ""But something as simple as the digestive tract of a goat or a sheep is actually really complex and a really interesting environment to look at ""¶ We actually have these sources of microbially sourced chemical diversity that are right there at our fingertips.""ù To raise just one example, UCSB researchers in the chemical engineering department, Michelle O'Malley and Swift, and their cross-university collaborators have been hard at work peering into the gut microbiome of large herbivores, cataloguing the genes within these which encode biosynthetic enzymes.†† For the researchers' samples, they used representative species of the thousands of species of gut fungi found in large herbivores. Four were selected, Anaeromyces robustus, Caecomyces churrovis, Neocallimastix californiae and Piromyces finnis, isolated from canary grass enrichment from sheep and goat feces in the Santa Barbara Zoo and the feces of a horse from a farm in Massachusetts.† From this, the researchers carried out a series of omics analyses at four different levels, looking at the genome, the mRNA, the proteins and the enzymes produced by the fungi and the final small molecules derived from those sources.†† ""So there's a lot of precedent in the literature about natural products. People know that there are these particular enzymes that make chemically diverse and interesting small molecules that are medicinally relevant like antibiotics,""ù Swift said.† The researchers decided to look at the DNA of these representative species to identify the enzymatic diversity ""î and in turn, the chemical potential ""î within the fungi. Then, the researchers looked at the active genes through the mRNA of the representative species to understand the other biomolecules which are tied to the final small molecule. Swift carried out sequencing experiments to characterize under what conditions these genes within the fungi may be expressed.† In conjunction with this, Swift's partners with the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory in the Pacific Northwest National Lab characterized the actual proteins and enzymes of these genomes to better understand what they do.† Finally, the small molecules themselves were characterized. ""It's a good idea to study biological information at these four different levels, because the level of complexity just gets higher and higher as you go to the final small molecule. [If all] we have is this metabolic soup of small molecules, it's a lot harder to say whether this small molecule is going to be a polypeptide versus a nonribosomal peptide, for instance,""ù Swift said.† Meanwhile, ""at the level of DNA, it's really easy to tell those different types of enzymes apart that make those small molecules.""ù† Through this analysis, the researchers found a host of genes (146 in total) which encode for biosynthetic enzymes and in turn natural products.† For Swift, such a discovery is particularly exciting because it's a new concept in general that these animals may have anaerobic fungi which make natural products at all. According to Swift,† their research is the first of its kind in scientific literature. In fact, in general, the digestive tracts of large herbivores haven't really been studied in the context of drug or antibiotic potential for decades, according to Swift. ""And there's nothing to the level that we have done where we've basically unraveled the whole chemical repository of these organisms and shown that it's very much under-appreciated in the context of natural products,""ù Swift said.†

science,Fleshing Out the Meaning of Regenerative Agriculture,12-Jun-21,2:00 PM,['Shereen Mohammadzadeh'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-06-12/fleshing-out-the-meaning-of-regenerative-agriculture/,"Soil is everywhere. And as of late, talk of soil is everywhere, at least within the circle of environmental advocacy.† Keep soil healthy, and benefits beyond just crop quality will ensue. Courtesy of National Resources Defense Council The semantics slightly vary across published sources, but ""regenerative agriculture""ù seems to stick most. It's the catchphrase for what is somewhat a new faith, where healthy soil is the savior that will resurrect Earth as it was before the anthropogenic stain. Look closely and find the two words making their appearance among documentarians and in branding. But where did this battle cry come from? And is it something more substantive than just that ""î a battle cry?† Yes, depending on who you ask.† The Rodale Institute ""î technically a nonprofit research center but basically the North Star of American organic agriculture ""î is an active mouthpiece for regenerative farming practices. Back in 1989, Robert Rodale, the son and successor of founder J.I. Rodale, explicitly introduced† ""regenerative""ù as a prefix to agriculture during an interview. He advocated the word ""regenerative""ù in lieu of ""sustainable""ù to describe the social and environmental improvements promised by low-input farming, which is farming that spares soil health by avoiding chemical applications.† ""I don't think the average person aspires to live in a sustained environment,""ù he explained. ""I think the idea of regeneration is [""¶] much more fruitful and an inventive, scientific concept to point the way to opportunities.""ù† In other words, a paradigm shift: abandoning chemical inputs doesn't have to merely sustain the conditions of the farmland and community. It is an opportunity to leverage the processes of healthy soil to improve, or regenerate, those conditions. Rodale wanted the verbiage to make that distinction clear.† Rodale's particularity about those semantics, and the meaning he hoped they would impart, have withstood time. According to the Rodale Institute today, ""Regenerative prioritizes soil health while simultaneously encompassing high standards for animal welfare and worker fairness. The idea is to create farm systems that work in harmony with nature to improve quality of life for every creature involved.""ù The essence follows Rodale's 1989 prototype: keep soil healthy, and benefits beyond just crop quality will ensue, especially in a social and environmental sense. Today, however, the Rodale Institute is even more particular about semantics, strictly referring to the practice as ""regenerative organic agriculture.""ù That is to suggest that regenerative practices bear no advantage without implicitly adopting organic practices too. Another protagonist of the regenerative agriculture conversation is Regeneration International, a nonprofit movement that was born in 2015 when 60 representatives of 21 nations met at a conference in Costa Rica. In 2017, Regeneration International released an official definition paper for regenerative agriculture, describing it as a ""holistic land management practice that leverages the power of photosynthesis in plants to close the carbon cycle, and build soil health, crop resilience and nutrient density.""ù Now, neither the Rodale Institute nor Regeneration International have succinctly defined regenerative agriculture in terms of what is ""î only what it should aim to accomplish and how. Such is the case with basically any source. Heck, its definition is so fluid that there is a whole website dedicated to pinning it down.† What does resonate across the board, though, is this idea of holism. Nearly every source argues that the benefits of soil health, the crux of regenerative agriculture, will permeate all domains of existence: the crops, the animals, the people, the atmosphere. That's an attractive conceptual framework, but let's slow down and investigate if the science behind healthy soil can really credit all this lofty talk. Healthy soil (top) compared to dry, compacted soil (bottom). Lance Cheung / Flickr First, it's important to note that agriculture in any form is disruptive to soil. As stated in a 2010 study on soil pathology, ""Most soils of natural ecosystems, even those substantially differing in fertility, should be referred to [as] healthy.""ù Earth knows what it's doing, so it would be happiest if we just let the soils be. That is what sets the health standard for soil. But since not growing food is not an option, the next best thing is doing so in a way that conserves microbial diversity, the foremost characteristic of healthy soil, as much as possible. Soils subject to conventional agricultural practices, which are designed to achieve maximum crop yields, do the exact opposite of that. Take monocultures, for instance. Entire fields dedicated to a single crop species translates to ""an absence of competitive biodiversity,""ù as discussed in a 2017 report by environmental activist Christopher Rhodes. That means that if a particularly harmful pathogen is introduced to a monoculture system, it will likely wipe out the entire crop field. Rhodes aptly points out that these exact conditions induced the Irish Potato Famine from 1845 to 1849. Alternatively, planting more than one crop species increases the chance that at least one of them could survive pathogen exposure and allow the agricultural system to persist.† However, the conventional strategy to prevent wide-scale crop failure is pesticide application, which kills off the soil's microbiome as much as pests themselves. Microbes are responsible for recycling nutrients back into the soil ""î calibrators that ready the land for new plants to grow. To make up for the death of microbes, conventional practices mandate the application of synthetic fertilizers to the fields.† Such intensive use of synthetic chemicals subjects factory and agricultural workers to exposure risks, namely a large variety of health problems. Consumers are not spared from risks either: Residues of chemicals remain in those very crops that feed humans and even more so livestock. The latter offers yet another insidious pathway for such chemicals to enter consumers, particularly those who eat meat, fish and dairy products, due to their bioaccumulative properties. Again, all of this is the price of yield-focused agriculture, which obliterates every other value that food can offer its consumers. Even though this is a super truncated glimpse into the conventional agricultural system, it is nonetheless an attestation to a broken agricultural system. A system that can only guarantee a high volume of nutritionally wan crops, ridden with the residues of synthetic chemicals, needs correction. It's worth exploring if approaches which prioritize soil health really can accomplish that.† Take polycultures, for instance. Crop rotation, multi-cropping or inter-cropping promote a mimicry of naturally balanced biodiversity in the field. The resulting pool of soil microbes serve to defend against phytopathogenic developments, taking the role of pesticides.† The decaying residues of diversified crops deposit a corresponding variety of nutrients into the soil, where they are converted into usable form anew by decomposing microbes: nature's fertilizer.† Further practices can enhance this natural rapport while tackling other environmental concerns. Composting, which entails disposing of food and yard waste separately from trash, is an easy practice that provides local farms with a diversifying, organic and ""nutritious soil amending agent""ù to use in place of synthetic fertilizers. Composting diverts waste from the landfill and spares agricultural workers from both the monetary and health price imposed by lower-quality synthetic fertilizers. When ruminants roam freely, ""they aerate, fertilize, and restore the soils.""ù Courtesy of Pixabay Even ethical approaches to raising livestock adds fire to the cause. A 2013 report by the Savory Institute, a movement dedicated to the regeneration of grasslands, outlines how consciously ""renewing the relationship of grazing animals to grasslands""ù promotes chemical and mechanical processes that enrich the nutrient content of the soils. In short, when ruminants roam freely, distributing natural manure and trampling decaying plant matter into the ground, ""they aerate, fertilize, and restore the soils.""ù† Still, it gets better. An innovation plan by Carbon180 confirms that the tantamount co-benefit of these soil-diversifying practices is carbon sequestration. Put simply, the ""processes that govern soil carbon transformation and stabilization are largely microbial driven.""ù So, there really is some credibility to regenerative agriculture's rhetoric of ""oneness.""ù Just as holistically broken systems feed themselves, there is growing proof that holistically healthy systems do the same. What also makes these said regenerative practices attractive is that they intrinsically welcome participation from anyone. Whether at-home composting or starting a garden, those solutions can be realized in our own homes. Who wouldn't want to feel the nobility of that? The most challenging part of regenerative agriculture is, likely, fulfilling the component of social fairness. The logic is sound: Farmers deserve due compensation for work that prioritizes the health of consumers, of animals, of the atmosphere and of themselves, for crying out loud. So it's easy to hope that social fairness will ensue. But, history has its counterpoints.† For communities that had already been living out regenerative practices, fairness did not ensue. As a matter of fact, their land was stolen. Regenerative agriculture's holistic approach emulates the hallmarks of American Indian livelihoods: the harmonies of man, soil, water, air, vegetation and wildlife. What is at stake for numerous American Indians fighting for civil rights is meanwhile branded elsewhere as an exciting environmental movement. †One article highlights this exact irony by comparatively reviewing two 2020 food-system documentaries, ""Kiss the Ground""ù and ""Gather.""ù It warns against an egregious fault that some so-called spearheads of regenerative agriculture commit: ""profiting from wisdom held by Indigenous farmers for centuries.""ù Another examination of the issue remarks, ""The regenerative agriculture movement also heavily borrows, without due recognition, from the practices carried out in Black agricultural communities.""ù† Before moving forward, regenerative agriculture owes a reckoning with its social disparities. So, while regenerative agriculture is still very much a fluid concept, its momentum is steadfast. If it stays accountable to its foundation of holistic and diversifying approaches, in a social sense as much as an agricultural sense, then it will hold all the more promise for a better future. It will be more than just a battle cry.

science,Thinking Ahead: How Do UCSB Students Feel About Climate Change?,20-Jun-21,11:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-06-20/thinking-ahead-how-do-ucsb-students-feel-about-climate-change/,"In California, climate change is at the forefront of innumerable public conversations and policy discourse ""î and with good reason.† A Santa Barbara sunset set alight in a foreboding glow by the Thomas Fire, at one point the largest single fire in California since records began. Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus People living in the West have been increasingly battered by the effects of extreme weather intensified by a warming climate. Warming days and nights dry out the landscape and prime it for widespread and sometimes catastrophic fires.† Meanwhile, drier dry seasons are interspersed with torrential rains when they do come, leading to weather whiplash. The impacts are costly, dangerous and increasingly visible. The same Lake Oroville which was threatened with spillway failure in February 2017 following record rain now has such low water levels in 2021 that the hydropower plant beneath it is being threatened with shutdown later this season for the first time in history. Even closer to home, the effects of climate change remain similarly pronounced and pernicious. Santa Barbara County is among the fastest warming counties in the lower 48. Neighboring Ventura County to the east is, in fact, the fastest-warming county in the lower 48.† So, what do we think of this? Julia Fine, a graduate student in the linguistics department at UCSB, is working alongside an array of collaborators to better understand how UCSB students relate to the climate crisis ""both in terms of their attitudes towards it, their experiences and their interest in different types of action,""ù Fine said.† ""We wanted to do this in a way that would be useful to student climate justice organizations and environmental justice organizations on campus, like Eco Vista, the Sunrise Movement and the [California] Environmental Justice Alliance.""ù In order to do this, Fine and her collaborators interviewed a number of local students in fall 2020, with their results and discussion later published in May of this year.† In addition to inquiring students about their personal experiences with and sentiments on climate change, Fine and her collaborators wanted to learn about students' mindsets toward climate change and initiatives that are aiming to mitigate the effects of climate change and eventually stop it in its tracks. Do students believe that climate change is an immediate issue? What kinds of climate action would students be interested in? What barriers are keeping students from taking action? How can organizations adjust and better incorporate those who want to help, but don't quite know how? All of these were questions Fine wanted the answers to.† ""Respondents overwhelmingly acknowledged climate change as a real and very serious problem, with the seriousness of the issue rated nine out of 10. We got very few climate deniers as well.""ù† In addition, many respondents reported being personally affected by climate change in some way or another, either due to impacts from wildfire and the necessity of evacuation, air quality issues or even temperature extremes themselves.† Paired with this were the mental health impacts of the issue, with respondents mentioning anxiety, worry, stress, fear and guilt ""î as well as sadness and frustration.† ""I would say that the overall level of concern and alarm is higher than I would have thought. And also, that far more people than I would have expected were directly impacted,""ù Fine said, adding that ""that could be because of the fires in fall 2020, which seemed to be a really prominent theme in this survey.""ù However, coexisting with the urgency and concern was confusion regarding how to contribute and be a part of the solution. Many respondents felt that they lacked awareness of opportunities, didn't have free time to offer, had a lack of interest in the opportunities they were aware of and also didn't feel that they could be effective as part of a solution.† Some specifically also stressed disinterest in efforts like marches and protests, instead preferring educational events and actions with direct and visible impacts.† Fine also found a socioeconomic relationship between lower-income students and an inability to take action.† ""Something both obvious and really important, I think, is that we found that students with lower income tended to say that they were prevented from participating in climate action because of not having enough free time,""ù Fine said. ""That really has ""î I think ""î a pretty profound implication, which is that compensating students for climate action would make it more accessible to people.""ù With this information in hand ""î and forwarded to advocacy groups on campus ""î Fine sees several courses of action as tenable, including establishing new courses at the university and seeking new sources of funding and financial resources for climate action.

Courtesy of The Noun Project Indeed, this truism is evident in everything we do. Humans largely live in communities, exist in broad social circles and work with other humans almost constantly. In work settings in particular, many tasks are collaborative and performed in a team of people, requiring communication and interpersonal skills.† Despite this, many professionals, organizations and researchers focus on individual ability when attempting to measure performance and the contributions of an individual to the larger whole. Recently, there has been strong pushback disputing the effectiveness of such practices. A landmark 2010 study published in Science Magazine, for instance, found that there was a single statistical factor that reproducibly had an association with a group's performance in a wide variety of tasks.† The researchers coined this the ""collective intelligence factor,""ù which was correlated not with general intelligence but instead with the social sensitivity of group members, the degree to which turns in conversation were taken equally and the proportion of women in the group.†† ""They gave a bunch of different tasks to groups of people instead of individuals, and then they tried to measure whether the group had some sort of underlying abilities that made them perform well,""ù said Young Ji Kim, an assistant professor in the communication department at UCSB. Kim has been studying the concept of collective intelligence since 2014, when she began working with the Center for Collective Intelligence at MIT.† Kim, in collaboration with researchers from Northeastern University, MIT and Carnegie Mellon University, wanted to go further to validate the significance of this factor of general intelligence and draw from a larger sample to see if the same findings could be reproduced. To do this, Kim and her collaborators carried out a meta-analysis on 22 studies evaluating collective intelligence in 1,356 groups and 5,279 individuals.† ""This is a pretty impressive number because it's really hard to recruit a large group of people to the lab or for field studies and conduct these studies ""¶ now we have more confidence in the findings that were previously had,""ù Kim said.† This wellspring of studies that the researchers drew from was able to be so large because of a novel method of conducting experiments. The data in the studies analyzed had been obtained using the Platform for Online Group Studies (POGS), a platform that allows researchers to conduct experiments over the internet.†† With POGS, the researchers were largely able to avoid more costly and logistically challenging traditional methods of conducting experiments. In addition, because the studies all used POGS, they also shared the same data collection method.† ""So using more and more diverse samples, we find similar results. There is like a single general factor that explains a group's ability to work together well,""ù Kim said.† Kim and her collaborators found once again that this factor was not merely the aggregate of individual intelligence among members of the group; instead, it was defined by the process by which people work together in the group. It was also influenced by the proportion of women in the group.† However, the researchers also found that groups with more women tended to have greater social perceptiveness, defined by Kim as an individual's ability to ""read""ù another individual's mental state or emotion.† ""It is actually explained by higher social perceptiveness, rather than just having more women ""¶† A lot of research suggests that women tend to have a high ability to perceive social cues ""î more than men ""î so that makes sense,""ù Kim said.† Even in light of this research, however, Kim suggests the need to evaluate studies conducted in a wider variety of contexts.† ""Even if we have 22 different studies from various samples, we haven't covered all kinds of contexts, and context is important, especially in this field of study where a lot of different factors come in and affect group performance,""ù Kim said.† ""There are competitions, different resources, different opportunities and power dynamics.

In environmental management studies, researchers created a methodology to assess the environmental impacts associated with products throughout their life cycle. But is this assessment completely accurate? The researcher's study focused on future trajectories of potato production in the United States. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Considering both the successes and drawbacks of the modern agricultural systems, like climate change, air pollution and water quality deterioration, it's essential to look at how to create a sustainable food system. Eating healthy foods is a strategy that has emerged in response to this issue, but the environmental benefits of this change are unclear. So researchers across UC Santa Barbara's Bren School, UC Berkeley, Chongqing University, Dartmouth College and Leiden University decided to analyze how to improve the technique that measures these environmental benefits and drawbacks.† Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a way of measuring the environmental impacts in the stages of a product's life: raw material extraction, materials processing, manufacture, distribution and use. LCAs are the main way a food's environmental performance is measured. They can be used to infer environmental costs, benefits and trade-offs between different dietary choices. LCA ultimately can be used to inform public policy and improve product design.† ""Most of the LCA studies, they used past data, which is based on the average emissions, which may have been collected 10 years ago. If we use those past data, or the average data, it won't reflect a change in the future,""ù Yuwei Qin, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley who started this project when she was a doctoral student at the Bren School, explained. Due to complexities in human-environment interactions, there are economic, social and political factors that influence different outcomes for the future. Qin said, ""If we want to know what would happen, for example, if people will eat more vegetables, if they will have a healthy diet in the future, we cannot use those passive data to estimate what the future will be like.""ù Qin studied environmental policy in undergrad and continued into environmental management for her master's and doctor's degrees. In total, she has been in the environmental field for 12 years now. She became very interested in the LCA area during her master's study, where she then decided to contribute to life cycle research and related projects, focusing on the uncertainty of the life cycle assessment. This paper examining the non-linearity of LCA has been a side project and is about five to six years in the making.† To estimate the future as accurately as possible, Qin and her colleagues created models that were able to measure the different outcomes of future scenarios in which more potatoes need to be produced in the United States. The first, based on the way the market currently works, looks at taking the lowest production costs. The second looks at a high fuel price scenario, if there are high fuel taxes in the future. The third is based on a high water price scenario. This is more focused on the environment, where a shortage in water supply could result in higher water costs.† Qin reflected that the challenges in modeling these scenarios came from ""first building the model and then the data part.""ù Picking the right models and equations to optimize the runtime of data processing required Qin to do intensive literature reviews to find different economic strategies that addressed the scenarios explored. Qin also found it difficult to find irrigation and transportation data, so she decided to collaborate with experts in those fields to find the right sources.† Their results found that different environmental outcomes will come about depending on how economic constraints, social factors and policy measures play out. The current LCA model of the economic system as it stands doesn't adequately address the question of dietary shift and what decisions should be made. Therefore, the model they developed can be extrapolated to other products and used to understand the impacts from changes in demands.† Regarding where this work can be taken, Qin stated, ""First, we can apply this technology more to other products.""ù The model isn't limited to just vegetables but can also be used for technology as well. ""Second, we can build a more comprehensive database that includes not only the average emissions but also the marginal emissions, so that we can have a better estimate of what the environmental impacts would be in the future.""ù Comments are closed.

science,Researchers Study PTSD-related Symptoms Among LGBTQ Latinx Immigrants,18-Jul-21,11:56 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-07-18/researchers-uncover-concerning-trend-in-ptsd-related-symptoms-among-lgbtq-latinx-immigrants/,"The process of immigrating from one country to another ""î particularly for those seeking asylum or lacking resources to otherwise move through traditional channels ""î is already one fraught with uncertainty. For this particular research, they conducted their study with 194 SGM Latinx immigrants. Courtesy of Wikimedia† Commons However, those who are minorities even within that sphere, such as sexual and gender minority (SGM) immigrants, face a slew of additional issues from discrimination ""î both from those within their immigrant community and the broader sphere ""î leading to greater levels of stress and negative health outcomes.† Alison Cerezo and Amaranta Ramirez, researchers at UC Santa Barbara's Department of Counseling, Clinical, and School Psychology who are working in collaboration with Fernando Estrada from the Department of Specialized Programs in Professional Psychology at Loyola Marymount University, have sought to better understand this relationship between stress from acculturation, discrimination and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cerezo and Estrada both come from backgrounds informed by work in nonprofits and community outreach. Cerezo in particular described how working with a trans-Latina organization for a number of years led her to become further aware of the challenges they and others encountered in accessing mental health support while simultaneously facing significant hardships related to discrimination.† Of particular relevance to this issue was a 2019 Trump administration policy, formally rescinded in June of this year, known as ""Remain in Mexico.""ù This policy returned those seeking asylum in the U.S. to Mexico while they awaited their court dates in the United States.† Such a policy was particularly problematic for Latinx SGMs because it left them vulnerable while they waited for months and even more than a year to obtain asylum. According to Cerezo, Mexico lacks the infrastructure to support asylum seekers, for one thing. However, beyond that, SGM asylum seekers also found themselves victims of violence related to their being LGBTQ while they waited in Mexico. ""It should have been the case that they could seek asylum at the border and then be able to wait in a detention center or something, that they'd be able to actually have some system of support as an asylum seeker,""ù Cerezo said. ""That should be their legal right, but it wasn't given to them, and as a result, an overwhelming majority of LGBT immigrants who were staying in Mexico did experience violence related to being LGBT.""ù However, SGM Latinx immigrants even within the United States also have to contend with unique challenges, such as discrimination from those within their smaller immigrant communities upon which they ordinarily rely for resources and support.† According to Estrada and Cerezo, this results in a multiple minoritized experience, in which SGMs who leave their country to escape from discrimination find themselves in the U.S. living among people who perpetuate that same sort of discrimination. Meanwhile, the stress of acculturation only compounds the issue.† ""We tried to understand what it is exactly that we're really looking at, and how can this data inform future studies whether that be qualitative or more quantitative. We collected data that was about trauma and stress ""î but we also collected data that was about resilience and strengths,""ù Cerezo added.† For this particular research, they conducted their study with 194 SGM Latinx immigrants, and used an intersectional-cultural theory of stress to look at the degree to which symptoms related to PTSD are associated with intersectional discrimination and acculturative stress. They found a robust correlation and in addition discovered that not even high levels of social support insulated SGM Latinx immigrants from developing PTSD symptoms.† With such data, the researchers hope to be equipped to inform future policy and provide assistance to those who may stand to benefit the most from more focus and resources. ""It was important for us to show that PTSD-related symptoms do correlate positively with things like acculturative stress and discrimination. To show that link is important for other reasons, like a research and scholarship perspective, but especially from a clinical, mental health and provision of services perspective,""ù Estrada said. † † † † † †††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† Comments are closed.

science,UC Researchers Dive Deeper Into the Nitrogen Cycle at Sedgwick Reserve,3-Aug-21,11:21 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-03/uc-researchers-investigate-newly-discovered-component-of-nitrogen-cycle-at-sedgwick-reserve/,"Nitrogen is a common and abundant element in the universe, serving many important functions for life on Earth. It makes up much of the atmosphere and our bodies, being a key component of amino acids and proteins, DNA and RNA, and ATP ""î the molecule which provides energy to many biological processes and living cells.† The researchers looked at semi-arid ecosystems, specifically oak savanna and woodland. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus In human society, nitrogen also has paramount importance as a component of fertilizers and many other essential products.† Quite literally, nitrogen is essential ""î biologically, environmentally and economically. Nitrogen is even an essential component of climate and climate modeling in how it affects plant growth.† Like other important elements and molecules, nitrogen is cyclic in nature, moving from the air to landscapes to living things and back again through a series of chemical and physical processes. While nitrogen is indeed abundant in the atmosphere, it's locked up in a triple-bonded molecule known as dinitrogen. In order to be taken up by living things, this bond must be broken.† ""In nature, there's a couple of different ways that bond can be broken. One is by lightning in the atmosphere. It generates a huge amount of electricity in one area, and it actually breaks the bonds in the vicinity of the nitrogen and produces ammonium,""ù said Oliver Chadwick, a professor in the Department of Geography at UC Santa Barbara. ""That's an available form of nitrogen, and that rains out and can be used by organisms.""ù† In addition, legumes and other plants, which have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, serve to break up strongly bonded dinitrogen for use by other plants. ""However, recently, about 20 years ago, we began to realize that that was an oversimplification,""ù Chadwick said.† According to Chadwick, our understanding of the nitrogen cycle has found itself upended, specifically the notion that much of the nitrogen we find on land arrived there from the atmosphere. It turns out, there is one other piece to this equation: Nitrogen is derived from the weathering of rock.†† In 2018, researchers from UC Davis published a paper calculating the nitrogen budget of Earth, consisting of a record of the inputs, outputs and retention of terrestrial nitrogen on Earth.† They took into account newly realized nitrogen sources from surface rock and found an 8 to 26% increase in the nitrogen budget. In the wake of this and other developments, many researchers have scoured site after site in search of more information regarding these nitrogen sources. Chadwick, working in collaboration with other researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, UC Davis and UC Riverside ""î particularly Nina Bingham of UC Davis ""î has recently studied nitrogen derived from rocks in various soils, hoping to understand what role such a source of nitrogen might play in one of many varietal living systems.† Of particular interest to Chadwick and his collaborators was how nitrogen sources from rock might factor into the nitrogen cycle in semi-arid ecosystems, specifically the oak savanna and woodland regions found throughout the lower elevations of California.† ""We would expect it in an arid environment that the weathering would be slower. So you might expect that the [nitrogen] input would be slower as well. What Nina did was to tackle this question,""ù Chadwick said. Chadwick and his collaborators pinpointed a specific location for their study: Sedgwick Reserve in the Santa Ynez Valley, due north of Santa Barbara, just across the Santa Ynez Mountain range.† The researchers used basic tracers of rock weathering to get more information about this question, specifically turning to geochemical mass balance weathering flux measurements of other bedrock-derived nutrients, like phosphorus, potassium and silicon, which informed the researchers of the rate of rock weathering exhibited by the grassland ecosystem they were working in. With this information, the researchers uncovered quite a lot of local variation depending on the location of individual sites on mountain slopes and crests. However, ultimately, the researchers found that Sedgwick in general lacked a high rate of weathering, meaning that the reserve as a whole could trace most of its nitrogen to the atmosphere and biological processes.† ""We find that the contribution at least in semi-arid, relatively low erosion environments such as Sedgwick is really very low. And then most of the nitrogen is indeed coming from the biological fixation and atmosphere,""ù Chadwick said. ""Although it's interesting that rock is delivering nitrogen to ecosystems, at least in Sedgwick it's not going to be a big contributor to the functioning of the system.""ù Comments are closed.

science,Looking Back at the Campaign to Save the West Mesa,10-Aug-21,10:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-10/looking-back-at-the-campaign-to-save-the-west-mesa/,"On June 8th, over 101 acres of land in the West Mesa adjacent to the San Marcos Foothills Preserve were finally protected from development. This ended a nearly yearlong campaign to preserve the West Mesa and expand the land protected as part of the county preserve. The battle was won with the support and money of thousands of community members, the tireless efforts and organizing of a close-knit circle of conservation advocates and the resolve of a number of peaceful protesters, many indigenous. Below is a compilation of events and milestones which shaped the West Mesa's road to preservation. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus 2005: Approval of Portion of San Marcos Foothills for Conservation After much tumultuous back-and-forth, with several failed development proposals dating to the 1980s and 1990s, Santa Barbara County approved the San Marcos Foothills for conservation in November 2005 following community advocacy demanding this designation, according to Environmental Defense Center member Linda Krop. 2007: Approval of Housing Development and Establishment of San Marcos Foothills Preserve In January 2007, following several years of negotiation and public demands to designate the location for conservation purposes, the owner of the 377-acre San Marcos Foothills property, Bermant Development Company, working alongside local government and Santa Barbara County Parks, subdivided the land into parcels. Approximately 200 acres of the property were christened a county preserve called the San Marcos Foothills Preserve.† A portion of the adjacent open space, roughly one-third or 50 acres of land, including parts of the West Mesa and some surrounding open space below the preserve, was agreed to be slated for eventual residential development.† 2008: San Marcos Foothills Preserve Opens to the Public In early October 2008, the San Marcos Foothills Preserve opened to the public. Second District Supervisor at the time Janet Wolf attended this ceremony, commending the efforts to preserve the land.† Erik Axelson, the deputy director of the Santa Barbara County Parks Department and the individual tasked with developing a plan for the preserve, discussed his hopes that the arrangement satisfies both developers and preservationists. He also discussed management priorities, namely light maintenance of the trail system and land fortification of the preserve intended to prevent erosion.† The ceremony closed with a traditional blessing intended to encourage the ""healing and proper keeping of mother earth,""ù from Art Cisneros, a member of the Barbare√±o Chumash. August 2020-March 2021: The Fight To Get Back Land Save San Marcos Foothills began fundraising in earnest in August 2020. The organization was largely established in response to news of the proposed developments and hearings by the Chadmar Group scheduled for September 2020 at the South Board of Architectural Review, wherein road and utility infrastructure development that winter was ultimately approved. Conservation advocates from Channel Islands Restoration, including Elihu Gevirtz and Ken Owen, as well as other community activists, notably Nancy Tubiolo, Julia Laraway, Dani Lynch and Samantha Eddy, were the first to speak on the issue and advocate buying the West Mesa land parcels for preservation.† Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus The organization set out contacting media outlets, carrying out community outreach and soliciting donations in order to reach this goal. Their Instagram page made its first post on Oct. 11, 2020.† Save San the Marcos Foothills even received an anonymous 1 million dollar donation in early October, at that time the largest single donation. During the following several months, it comprised a majority of the funds accrued by the organization.† However, an uncertain valuation of the land ""î ranging anywhere from 5.5 million dollars to well in excess of 16 million dollars ""î and the lack of a purchase agreement between the Chadmar Group† and Save the San Marcos Foothills made building momentum for fundraising difficult, according to Tubiolo. February 2021: Legal Challenges† On Feb. 8, 2021 at the Save the San Marcos Foothills first public press event, the organization announced the initiation of several legal challenges to the Chadmar Group's proposed development.† Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus The event, which began with a traditional blessing from Ernestine Ygnacio-De Soto, a Barbare√±o Chumash Elder, also served to drum up attention for the existing fundraising drive by Save the San Marcos Foothills and featured a call to action for the public to continue fundraising while the litigation unfolded.†† Marc Chytilo, an environmental attorney affiliated with Save the San Marcos Foothills, was the person who announced these challenges. They included an objection to the establishment of flood control structures via an easement on the adjacent county park land as well as eight appeals to the Santa Barbara Architectural Board of Review, asking them to reconsider the project due to stipulations in the East Goleta Valley Community Plan. Gevirtz also voiced concerns regarding the ecological damage which would be wrought by the new development, citing the existing severe fragmentation of grassland habitat throughout the South Coast. February 25, 2021: Arrests† On Feb. 25, eight protesters ""î four of them Chumash women ""î were arrested at a protest against the development of the West Mesa wherein they blocked a bulldozer intended to be used for road grading. The protesters were later released that same day in the afternoon. Another protester at the site was cited but not arrested.† In response to this, Save the San Marcos Foothills made the following statement on their Instagram page, posted alongside a video from the protest: ""We want to highlight this arrest from today. An indigenous peaceful protestor is arrested for singing. For SINGING. Today's arrests were unjust. Today was peaceful, and indigenous bodies were unjustly targeted. We demand Santa Barbara does better. We ask for the protection of sacred lands and the respect of indigenous people.""ù† Following this development and the ensuing publicization of these arrests ""î not to mention the Chadmar Group's intention to proceed with the first stages of development ""î larger numbers of protestors arrived at the West Mesa the day after, continuing their protests through night and day to ensure that no further development occurs on the West Mesa. February 25 to March 10, 2021: Sit-in and Negotiations Meanwhile, behind the scenes, from Feb. 25 to March 10, Save the San Marcos Foothills engaged in negotiation with the Chadmar Group to settle on a proper valuation of the West Mesa property for the purposes of a purchase agreement and the eventual sale of the land parcels. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus While these negotiations were unfolding, a group of largely indigenous peaceful protesters continued to conduct a sit-in at the West Mesa property in wait for news of a purchase agreement. Some of these painted, drew, played instruments or silk-screened while on the West Mesa. Others in the broader community began fundraising to support the protesters and provide them with aid and resources during the wait.†† March 2021: The Offer To Buy Back Land† On March 10, the Chadmar Group and Save the San Marcos Foothills staged a joint press event to announce a legally binding purchase agreement regarding the West Mesa property.† Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus The agreement valued the property at 18 million dollars. In addition to that, another 2 million dollars would need to be fundraised by conservation advocates in order to finance an endowment to maintain and manage the property and pay for the campaign itself. This lump sum of money, 18 million dollars, would be due 90 days from the announcement, on June 2, 2021, with several increments working toward this goal, including 5 and 10 million dollars, also having explicit due dates. If these goals were not met, Save the San Marcos Foothills agreed to not further oppose ""any final permits, approvals, or the construction,""ù according to the joint statement. To facilitate this fundraising effort, Save the San Marcos Foothills also announced a partnership with the Santa Barbara Foundation and the establishment of a fiscal sponsorship fund, the Foothills Forever Fund, to collect donations from the broader community.† While the reaching of a purchase agreement was welcomed by advocates to preserve the land, many indigenous protesters who participated in the sit-in felt frustration with the press event and the erasure and perceived sanitization of the sit-in site, particularly the removal of protest signage.† As one anonymous protester put it: ""We were only given 24 hours to pack up and be out of here, just so they could get a nice pretty picture-""ù† ""-with none of our signage and none of our message, [it was] all painted over and erased,""ù another anonymous protester added. March 10 to June 9, 2021: Fundraising Thus began Save the San Marcos Foothills' rush to obtain 18 million dollars in a little under three months. This was accompanied by campaigns to solicit individual donations, partnerships with businesses and the hosting of various community events. Accompanying this was a wellspring of community activism, support and dollars.† ""The response from the community was unreal. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. So many people reposting, raffling things off, having yard sales and car washes and bake sales. It's really a beautiful thing how everybody has come together and worked through this adversity,""ù Marianne Parra, a spokeswoman for Save the San Marcos Foothills, said. Notable were various benefit concerts by local bands and more prominent acts, with virtual and later live performances by groups like Salty Strings, Iration, Glen Phillips, Zach Gill, Rich Mahan and Bruce Goldish.† The first threshold stipulated by the agreement was 5 million dollars raised by March 24. On March 25, an announcement on the Save the San Marcos Foothills' Instagram page was made, communicating that this benchmark was in fact met.† The momentum continued to build following this benchmark. By May 24, the movement had managed to raise 10.9 million dollars in 10 weeks. Immediately following that, on May 25, news broke that 1 million dollars had been donated by a single person in the name of preserving the foothills.† Then, on May 27, the Foothills Forever Fund received news of a massive 5 million dollar donation from an anonymous ""long-time local business woman.""ù† This donation single handedly brought the remaining fundraising balance to purchase the land to within 1.5 million dollars.† On June 2, the date of the original deadline for fundraising as stipulated by the agreement with the Chadmar Group, Save the San Marcos Foothills announced an extension to this deadline to June 9, having negotiated the extension with Chadmar following an outpouring of money and support. June 8, 2021: Completed Fundraising On June 8, 2021, Save the San Marcos Foothills reached their 18.6 million dollar fundraising goal to purchase the West Mesa property, well in excess of the 18 million dollar sum needed to purchase the West Mesa. Following this, the organization transitioned to Phase 2, which is ongoing, to raise money in order to retire existing loans, create an endowment, ""pay any final costs, and help to restore and steward the land into the future,""ù as the organization's Instagram page announced.†

science,"With California Heating Up, UCSB Researchers Study the Future of the State‚'s Fires",26-Aug-21,8:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-26/with-california-heating-up-ucsb-researchers-study-the-future-of-the-states-fires/,"Large and severe forest fires burn soil, kill off swathes of forest and leave a moonscape in their wake.† With time, things return. Flowers bloom beneath canopies of charred snags and shrubs take root, basking in the newfound abundance of sunlight. Then, with luck and even more time, saplings take root and begin their quest to rehabilitate the forest.† A pyrocumulus cloud generated by the Dixie Fire in the Northern Sierra. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons But this takes decades, even generations. In a California facing a hotter, drier future, the road to recovery ""î or even the road to understanding what comes next at all ""î is fraught with uncertainty.† ""Climate doesn't doesn't just affect fire, right? It also affects the ability of vegetation to recover from a fire. Climate affects how much vegetation you will have on the landscape and how productive forests are. And, of course, it also affects the water cycle,""ù said Naomi Tague, a researcher with the UC Santa Barbara Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Tague and Janet Choate, a research assistant in the Bren School at UCSB, in collaboration with other researchers from the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory and the University of Washington, are studying and fine-tuning models to better understand how the forests of the Sierra Nevada will respond as a changing climate shrinks the intervals at which wildfires strike.† Take the Dixie Fire, for instance. The largest fire in the United States so far this year, the behemoth blaze has torn through over 700,000 acres of land across the northern Sierra Nevada, some of which hadn't burned in over 40 years.† However, vast swathes affected by the Dixie Fire had already burned in the 21st century, including some 75,000 acres as recently as 2012 in the Chips Fire.† ""One of the core things that I do as a scientist is develop essentially simulation models that allow us to integrate both data and the conceptual understanding of how water and vegetation and climate interact,""ù Tague said.† ""To really put all that information together, you need simulation models. The other thing simulation models give you is an ability to develop ""òwhat if' scenarios, right? What if the future gets warmer, what if the future gets drier, how are these interactions between vegetation and water and climate going to play out?""ù† Tague's prior work along this vein examined how changing snowpack will affect streamflow and groundwater recharge, how drought will impact forest mortality, and other simulations beyond the scope of the Sierra Nevada, such as how greening infrastructure impacts waterflow or carbon sequestration.† In their most recent research, Tague and her collaborators focused on the Big Creek watershed in the southern Sierra Nevada, a region covering the rain-snow transition, which is particularly sensitive to climate change. They ran 60-year-long simulations detailing the impact of increasingly frequent drought and heat. Using the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System, or RHESSys, the researchers cut up the land into subdivisions containing overstory and understory vegetation, litter and soil. Then, on these individual parcels, they calculated vegetation growth, plant turnover and decomposition, and estimates of carbon and evapotranspiration. In conjunction with this, the researchers used WMFire to model fire initiation and spread ""î reproducing spatial patterns of spread observed in fires ""î as well as fire regimes, which are the patterns at which fires occur on a landscape over time.† They found that with progressively hotter and drier conditions, a pulse of repeated large and severe fires afflicted the land at first. However, after the first 10 years of the simulation, this trend reversed, and fires gradually decreased in size and frequency.† ""Initially you're going to get a bunch of big fires, but eventually those climate conditions will also retard plant growth ""¶ ultimately if things really do get hotter and drier, then you get into a place where you shift past this threshold and instead of being climate-limited, fires become fuel-limited,""ù Tague said.† According to Tague, the point at which this threshold is crossed depends on elevation and precipitation, with locations at lower elevations likely crossing it sooner than those at higher elevations. However, at least in their study site Big Creek, Tague was surprised by the speed with which the fire landscape transformed It also speaks to the looming threat of widespread and severe fires in the near future, according to Tague ""If everything kind of keeps on the same trajectory, eventually you're going to see this transition to more fuel-limited areas. However, there's a decade or so where you have a lot of high fire severity,""ù Tague said.† ""I just think it's important to be aware of that and realize that we're going to be managing high fire severity for the next decade in lots of parts of California. Forest management can help, but it's not going to get us out of that completely. Fire preparedness is going to be crucial.""ù† Comments are closed.

science,To the Limit: Long-Term Study Reveals How Kelp Forests Respond to Repeated Disturbances,29-Aug-21,8:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-29/to-the-limit-long-term-study-reveals-how-kelp-forests-respond-to-repeated-disturbances/,"Every winter, for 10 years, divers descended into kelp forest plots throughout the South Coast of California. Armed with knives and sometimes saws, they meticulously removed bunches of kelp from the canopy in imitation of the strong waves accompanying winter storms. In some plots, divers returned to the forests with greater frequency, removing bunches of kelp with every season. Meanwhile, other plots were left to their own devices, the canopy denuded only with the arrival of uncommonly powerful winter storms. † † † † † † † † A giant kelp forest, illuminated by rays of sun. Courtesy of Ronald H. McPeak In doing so, the divers set the stage for a decade-long research experiment, recently published in Ecology Letters. The question: How does a kelp forest respond to the repeated loss of the canopy? Even broader than that, though, was another question: How does a torrent of disturbances affect the underlying behavior of a forest ""î any forest ""î and how might the forest adapt? ""We hope that the processes that we are uncovering here are relevant to, you know, a broad array of ecosystems, but it's just an easier question to address in kelp forests than other systems,""ù said Dan Reed, a research biologist and the deputy director of the Marine Science Institute. ""The kelp forest is a really amenable system to work in to ask questions that relate to disturbance in the canopy and how that affects, you know, other primary producers and consumers in the forest.""ù Reed first began working on this project with his collaborators while leading the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research project, initially having designed the experiment in 2008. This program is one out of a network of sites that the National Science Foundation funds to conduct long-term research, a necessity when one wants to monitor ecological processes that occur on a multiyear or even decadal scale. The experiment itself, made up of sites from Carpinteria to Point Conception and extending out to Santa Cruz Island, has operated and been monitored since 2000. Initially, the experiment was devoted to monitoring watersheds and the interactions between the land and the ocean. However, when this topic of focus was cut back, Reed and his collaborators began looking increasingly into kelp forests. Noticing the similarities between kelp and terrestrial forests, the researchers were particularly interested in how the different layers of vegetation that are dispersed vertically throughout the canopy of the forest would adapt to the loss of the canopy. ""This particular paper focused on the extent to which primary production in the system would respond to this canopy being torn out every year. For instance, the understory algae that live beneath the kelp are typically shaded by the kelp,""ù Reed said. ""Would they then be allowed to grow at a level that would capture all the light and basically compensate for all the production that is lost by the giant kelp?""ù According to Reed, this is particularly relevant because of how a changing climate is anticipated to alter the frequency of severe storms that impact California. Climate projections show that as the area warms, rain events will be less frequent. However, the rain events that do manage to barrel through the Santa Barbara coast will more often be severe, bringing with them large waves which are capable of tearing up kelp canopies.† The researchers were able to monitor relatively large plots of varying kelp environments that ranged in their abundance of kelp and understory algae. With this, they had a snapshot of the broader kelp forest ecosystem and its nuances. With repeated disturbances, the researchers found that the difference between the experimental and the control plots, those which had kelp removed periodically and those which were left alone, respectively, continued to grow. Understory productivity from algae was still rising to compensate for the loss of the canopy and after several years had not managed to reach the productivity of the more intact kelp canopy. This stuck out to Reed. ""I actually thought that in a couple of years, things would kind of level out and we'd come to a new sort of equilibrium. I was surprised to see our data show that, in fact, the effects were continuing to increase, as long as they did. After 10 years, we still did not see a leveling out,""ù Reed said.† ""To me, that was surprising. And it also speaks to the value of long-term studies, right? You really do need to look at systems ""î even a system like ours that is really dynamic and really fast growing ""î over a relatively long period of time.""ù † †

science,"In a Landscape of Wet-Dry Whiplash, UCSB Researcher Develops New Method to Predict Water Deficits During Growing Season",21-Sep-21,10:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-21/in-a-landscape-of-wet-dry-whiplash-ucsb-researcher-develops-new-method-to-predict-water-deficits-during-growing-season/,"Water is essential to life, as everyone knows.† Because of this, the abundance and management of water resources in a region have far-reaching effects on stability, food security and quality of life. For those who farm crops or graze animals, reliable sources of water or the lack thereof make all the difference between crop booms and crop failures, with profound consequences for both farmers and their broader communities.† In Kisumu, Kenya, a farmer tends to his crops during the rainy season. Peter Kapuscinski / World Bank ""One of the ways to think about it is that drought happens when there's not enough water. It's a function of both supply and demand,""ù said Chris Funk, the Director of the Climate Hazards Center at UC Santa Barbara.† Unfortunately, for those living in both wet and dry regions across the world, changing precipitation patterns due to climate change have wrought havoc on once-expected norms. Extreme drought and torrential rain, being more drastic and frequent in recent years, have worsened food insecurity in some regions and even caused famine and human suffering. In order to avert catastrophe and mitigate the worst human impacts of extreme weather, many researchers have devised ways to predict the effects of natural disasters such as droughts and deluges. Known as early warning systems, the information from these tools is disseminated to both those in the public and those distributing aid to vulnerable populations.† For instance, Funk works with a global team of scientists to shape famine and weather-related disaster responses, develop better datasets and improve monitoring and prediction systems.† ""We've worked with partners, who take our satellite rainfall estimates, our very high-resolution weather forecasts, and our very high-resolution climate forecasts and put those into agricultural advisories that get sent out to hundreds of thousands of farmers in Kenya,""ù Funk said.† Recently, Funk, along with his other collaborators at the Climate Hazards Center, the United States Agency for International Development, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Physical Sciences Laboratory and the Sciences Applications International Corporation, have sought to make it easier for farmers ""î particularly those who rely on rainfall to water their crops ""î to predict growing season water deficits.† ""We have great capacity across timescales, to come up with forecasts for how much precipitation a place is likely to get. But we don't have a way to quickly translate that information into likely outcomes for farmers and pastoralists,""ù Funk said. ""If you have the ability to put weather forecasts and observations in the context of what plants need for healthy growth, it becomes more powerful.""ù Drawing from the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), a metric created decades ago by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations to measure agricultural drought stress, the researchers devised a new, simpler measure called the Phenological Water Balance (PWB). According to Funk, PWB is easier to calculate and to use in conjunction with climate observations and forecasts.† ""The [PWB] uses rainfall as the supply, and then it calculates water requirements [from crops] as the demand,""ù Funk said. ""[The] WRSI does the same kind of thing, but in a more complicated way, where it basically runs a hydrological model.""ù† ""A big motivation for the [PWB] is that you can get it to take our rainfall forecasts and translate them into plant water availability. And that gives us a much better way to track when there are gonna be rainfall deficits in the middle of the season,""ù Funk said.† In addition, the PWB can provide farmers with information about exceptionally wet conditions, like extreme precipitation events, which is something that the WRSI couldn't accomplish.† Funk and his collaborators validated their results by looking at data from Kenya, a region for which they have carried out forecasting. In recent decades, Kenyan farmers face irregular rainfall and increased drought due to climate change, which is especially a problem in the country's drier northern and eastern reaches.† Through this, the researchers found that the PWB metric performed as well as the WRSI metric.† ""It's not perfect, but it's really easy to use and it's performing at least as good as this much more complicated approach,""ù Funk said. ""One of the things that the screening really helped us see was how it looks like climate change is making the water demand a lot bigger in dry areas during drought.""ù† ""We'll probably be using the results to help guide ""¶ hundreds and millions of dollars of aid this year and next year. And so that's part of the excitement, I think, about the work we're doing. We're developing methods and then very quickly translating them to help safeguard lives.""ù

science,Professor Mostofi Uses WiFi Signals for Crowd Counting,23-Sep-21,9:00 AM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-23/professor-mostofi-uses-wifi-signals-for-crowd-counting/,"Since 2009, UC Santa Barbara's Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Professor Yasamin Mostofi and her lab have pioneered groundbreaking sensing methods using everyday radio frequency (RF) signals. Their work first began when they showed how Wi-Fi signals can be used to image through walls, and since then, the Mostofi Lab has uncovered the use of Wi-Fi signals specifically for crowd analytics. This ability had manifold applications from activity recognition to personal identification. ""However, people had to move around to be counted,""ù Mostofi said. ""Counting a seated crowd then remained a challenging and unsolved problem due to the lack of major body motion.""ù† This difficulty was the main motivation for Mostofi's most recent work, in which she and her team developed a new mathematical framework that enabled Wi-Fi signals to count a seated crowd using their natural body fidgets.† While seated, people will adjust in their seat and naturally engage in small, in-place motions, such as checking their phone, stretching, and crossing and uncrossing their legs. The aggregate natural fidgeting and natural in-place motion, Mostofi said, carry crucial information on the crowd count, and this information can be used to estimate the total number of people in a crowd.† According to Mostofi, the aggregate fidgeting process results from the superposition of the individual fidgeting sequences of each person. That aggregate process is what the Wi-Fi signals measure.† ""In this process, we defined two key parameters: the Crowd Fidgeting Periods (CFPs) which are the time periods in which at least one person in the area is fidgeting and the Crowd Silent Periods (CSPs) which are the time periods where no one in the area is fidgeting,""ù Mostofi said.† If there is a higher number of people in the crowd, there is a higher chance that the CFPs will be longer and the CSPs will be shorter. Mostofi's team then proposed a mathematical modeling that explicitly related these two parameters to determine the total number of people.† First, they showed how this specific problem resembled a decades-old, seemingly unrelated queuing theory problem. Queuing theory, according to Mostofi, is a branch of mathematics that studies waiting lines in systems that involve the arrival of customers.† ""The customers require a service from an entity that includes a number of servers,""ù Mostofi said. ""We then showed how the CSPs are similar to the times when no customer is at a queue that has infinite servers, while the CFPs resemble the times when at least one customer is being served at such a queue.""ù† Two WiFi transceivers, labeled Tx and Rx, count the nine participants in this part of Mostofi's study using the aggregate fidgeting process. These transceivers were able to count crowds at an accuracy of 96.3%. Courtesy of Yasamin Mostofi This relation allowed Mostofi and her team to borrow mathematical tools from queuing theory to develop an entirely new technique to count the number of stationary people. They validated this approach by conducting 47 experiments in four different areas. In these experiments, up to 10 people sat in different positions, engaging in different activities like reading or watching TV. Twenty of the 47 experiments were conducted through walls in which the Wi-Fi transceivers were placed behind a wall and counted the number of people on the other side.† ""In non-through-wall scenarios, our counting error was zero or one in 96.3% of the experiments, while in through-wall scenarios, our counting error was zero or one in 90% of the experiments, showing a very good counting performance,""ù Mostofi said. ""These results show that it is possible to count a stationary (or seated) crowd, using cheap, everyday Wi-Fi signals.""ù According to Mostofi, this is applicable to several scenarios in everyday life, as well as optimizing newer, eminent technologies.† ""The ability to count the number of people in an area is important for smart buildings, in order to optimize heating, cooling and lighting,""ù Mostofi said. ""Crowd counting can also be very important during a pandemic (such as COVID-19), as it can provide an early warning if the public safety and crowd count limitation guidelines are being violated. Businesses and events can also benefit from crowd counting for planning purposes.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 19 of the Sept. 23, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,"As Oceanic Oxygen Levels Drop in Warming Seas, Fish Flee to Shallower Waters, Researchers Find",23-Sep-21,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-23/as-oceanic-oxygen-levels-drop-in-warming-seas-fish-flee-to-shallower-waters-researchers-find/,"Often, the major focuses of ocean climate change are bold and visible: The melting Arctic ice sheet, bleached and weakened tropical reefs and ocean acidification come to mind.† However, an equally important, but often-overlooked factor impacting marine life across the world is the gradual, yet imperceptible and potentially catastrophic phenomenon of oceanic deoxygenation.† Just like terrestrial animals, fish and other marine animals require the dissolved oxygen found in water to survive and can suffocate without it. While many species are able to endure a range of oxygen levels in their habitat, climate change is driving many fish to live in conditions that are increasingly intolerable. For some species, survival means fleeing to places that lie outside the bounds of their natural habitat. ""One thing climate change is doing is it's causing these tongues of water with very little oxygen to creep up shallower and shallower along the seafloor in California,""ù said Milton Love, a research biologist with the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute.† Love has studied various rock reefs throughout the Santa Barbara Channel for much of his career. In 1995, Love began conducting monitoring on reefs as part of a federally funded long-term research project. Originally, the project intended to examine how oil platforms, such as those visible from Isla Vista along the Santa Barbara Channel, may serve as fish habitat. In a rock reef in the Santa Barbara Channel, a cowcod (Sebastes levis) emerges from the seafloor to look at a manned submarine. Courtesy of Milton Love In order to answer this question, the researchers turned to rock reefs in surrounding areas near the oil platforms to better understand marine life in the region.† ""We did these surveys around lots of oil platforms off California, but if you don't know what lives on natural reefs, you only know part of the story. We had to go and look at natural reefs for a frame of reference,""ù Love said.† ""[Basically,] we were comparing the fishes that lived on these natural reefs with the fishes that live on oil platforms off California, just to get a sense of whether the fish assemblages were the same or different.""ù† In 2010, Love encountered a paper which posited that low oxygen levels would cause fish to move to shallow waters within or even beyond their habitat.† ""What's going to happen to reef fishes that like oxygen, what are they going to do? Well, I guess they could just sit there and die, but probably, according to this paper, they will move to get out of the way of all this bad water by going shallower and shallower.""ù† Erin L. Meyer-Gutbrod, the lead author of the study who worked with Love as a postdoctoral researcher ""î and is now an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina ""î wanted to put that idea to the test with real data.† Rising temperatures cause declines in oxygen for a couple of reasons. For one, warmer water by nature holds less oxygen. In addition, warm temperatures result in stratification between cold deep water and warm shallow water. This is problematic, according to Love, because the main source of dissolved oxygen in the ocean comes from atmospheric mixing at the sea surface and stratification keeps oxygen from mixing further down.† Over the last 60 years, the upper reaches of the Northeast Pacific, a region that includes the California coast, has lost 15% of its oxygen. In specific regions of the Santa Barbara Channel that Love and his collaborators have been studying, they have observed declines in oxygen everywhere.† From 1995 to 2009, dozens of visual fish surveys were performed at a number of the rock reef sites around the Channel Islands. However, only a select few were repeatedly visited and monitored over an extended period of time. Of these, only three were included in the current study. These sites, named Anacapa Passage, Footprint and Piggy Bank are, in one way or another, representative of a broad variety of the marine habitat found near reefs, with varying seascapes, topography, size and species composition.† Anacapa Passage, at 50 meters of depth on average, consists of slabs of stone through which narrow passages, known as rills, have been eroded and now play host to marine life. Meanwhile, the Footprint is an underwater mountain top, at 150 meters of depth on average, known as a seamount. Different from both of them is the Piggy Bank, the deepest site, at 300 meters of depth on average, with a summit crowned by boulder fields and slopes that descend into the mud. The researchers looked at 60 different species of reef fish, such as California sheephead, copper rockfish and blue rockfish, and found that of the 23 types of fish which moved to different depths along the seafloor, a vast majority of fish types (19 in total) moved upwards to shallower water, while only four species moved deeper over the same period.† ""Now what's intellectually interesting to me is, well, the data ended in 2009. Did the process continue? It's been 11 years. I'd love to get some money and go back and revisit these sites,""ù Love said.

science,Tracing the Pandemics of California Past,25-Sep-21,3:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-25/tracing-the-pandemics-of-california-past/,"The colonization of Indigenous populations throughout the Americas following the arrival of Europeans is known as one of the most drastic demographic events to ever occur in human history.† A replica Chumash home, known as an ""òAp, in Satwiwa, near the Santa Monica Mountains. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus This depopulation fundamentally reshaped the continents, disrupted Indigenous lifeways, destroyed communities and threatened the existence of cultures and peoples who were besieged by European invaders, such as the English, French and particularly the Spanish. In a manner which is particularly relevant now, with the present era of COVID-19, one of the most devastating impacts to arise from the Spanish colonial system emerged in the form of disease, wherein the Spanish brought with them pathogens which the Indigenous population had not been exposed to prior and had few defenses against.† John Johnson, a professor in the UC Santa Barbara Department of Anthropology, has sought to understand the manner in which these devastating pandemics unfolded throughout California during the mission period and how this might diverge from existing hypotheses brought forth by other archaeologists.† ""The whole objective of this was to take an empirical look at when the onset of these pandemics historically really began impacting the native population,""ù Johnson said.† ""Some authors had suggested that right at the beginning, when Cabrillo first sailed up the California coast in 1542, there would have been the opportunity for disease spread and that there may have been epidemics before there was actual colonial settlement in Alta California.""ù† Johnson, who also works as the Curator of Anthropology with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, was approached by Terry L. Jones, a professor in the Social Sciences Department at Cal Poly, who inquired if Johnson would be able to collaborate on a project to study the demography of Native Californians following the arrival of the Spanish and other European invaders.† Since he was a graduate student at UCSB in 1988, Johnson has studied records from the Spanish missions in Santa Barbara County, using them to better understand demographic trends among the Chumash, Indigenous people who lived throughout the coastal regions stretching from Morro Bay to Malibu, including most of the Channel Islands.† Jones aimed to construct a dataset to examine the demographic structure of the Indigenous population in California from Central California to the San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento area.† By using a prehistoric osteological dataset and combining this with historical data from the mission period, the researchers were able to compile the largest dataset of mortality records yet seen in North America, with 33,715 records spanning from 3050 B.C. to A.D. 1870 ""î almost 5,000 years.† ""It was quite a robust dataset in the end,""ù Johnson said. The researchers found that the onset of depopulation amongst Californians indeed coincided with the settlement ""î†not discovery ""î of California by Europeans: about 1769, as Johnson described. This is when the first mission, Mission San Diego de Alcal√°, was established and was quickly followed by missions on the Central Coast, the Bay Area and the Los Angeles area.† ""This really tragic consequence of colonialism, in the colonial period, occurred when actual colonial settlement began to take place, when missions and other settlements were being established in California and there was sustained contact between Europeans and native Californians. That's when you got the real disease transmission,""ù Johnson said.† Such a revelation also debunks a hypothesis occasionally peddled by other archaeologists: The abundant game and wildlife in California during the early colonial period existed as an artifact of post-contact ""î but pre-settlement ""î epidemics.†† ""A few people argued that there was less hunting going on and therefore, the abundant game that was described around the lakes in the Central Valley and along the coast [in literature] existed as a consequence of this hypothesized depressed population ""î because of disease,""ù Johnson said.† ""We tested that whole idea, and we don't find any evidence for there being pandemics prior to actual colonial settlement.""ù† A few ideas stick out to Johnson for why this is the case. For one thing, while Europeans traveled throughout California in the intervening centuries between contact and settlement, sustained contact only began following settlement.† In addition, the mission system itself, which was established by Catholic priests to evangelize the native Californians and effectively subjugated them, also created points of contact and exchange which reshaped how Native Americans interacted with Europeans and one another.† ""The other thing that happened during mission times is that people, you know, came to the missions. They started living together in large communities, adjacent to the missions,""ù Johnson said.† ""In the native society, they were distributed throughout the landscape, throughout the country and in smaller villages.""ù

Courtesy of the Department of Defense The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD) says people 65 years or older and people 50-64 years old with underlying medical conditions should receive the booster. These individuals are eligible for a booster five months after the date they received their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. People aged 18-49 with underlying medical conditions and people aged 18-64 who are prevalently exposed to COVID-19 in either an institutional or occupational setting may receive the booster dose at least six months after the date of their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Booster shots are offered at local pharmacies and health care providers in Santa Barbara County.† These guidelines do not apply to those who received the Moderna or Janssen (J&J) vaccine. As of Sept. 28, a booster shot of either vaccine is not yet available. According to the CDC, as more data becomes available, additional populations will be recommended for the booster shot.† ""Booster shots will become an important part of our local strategy to protect our most vulnerable community members and end the pandemic,""ù SB County Public Health Director Van Do-Reynoso said in a press release last Friday. SBCPHD says that vaccines approved and administered in the U.S. remain extremely effective. However, the booster shot is meant for those whose post-inoculation protection against COVID-19 has waned over time. The booster shot maximizes that protection, with the intention of making it more long-lasting. CDC studies show that vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection is decreasing, partially due to waning immunity as well as the evolution of COVID-19, particularly the severity of the Delta variant.† The approved distribution of booster shots to immunocompromised and at-risk individuals in the U.S. follows a worldwide moratorium on boosters called by the World Health Organization (WHO). At a media briefing earlier this month, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the push for boosters an inequitable distribution of resources that could help end the pandemic.† ""Globally, 5.5 billion vaccine doses have now been administered, but 80 percent have been administered in high- and upper-middle income countries,""ù Ghebreyesus said. ""High-income countries have promised to donate more than 1 billion doses, but less than 15 percent of those doses have materialised.""ù

Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus However, with coastal development throughout their range ""î and particularly rampant development in Southern California ""î their numbers began to dwindle during the mid-20th century as their habitats became increasingly fragmented.† Being birds which rely on relatively undisturbed beaches to nest and reproduce, coastline management throughout California served to imperil the species, as even forms of recreation like sunbathing, dog walking and beachcombing made many beaches unsuitable for nesting.† By the year 2000, there were only 1,500 breeding snowy plovers nesting throughout all of coastal California, a precipitous drop for a species which once numbered in the thousands.† However, there are still refuges throughout California where the plovers continue to nest. One of the most important of these is at Sands Beach on Coal Oil Point Natural Reserve, less than a mile from UC Santa Barbara. Here, the conservation program for the snowy plovers seeks to protect the plovers nesting on Sands Beach to perpetuity.† Such a thing is especially remarkable because for decades, there were no breeding pairs of snowy plovers at Sands Beach.† The program, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, has been responsible for maintaining and monitoring the snowy plovers of Sands Beach, the long stretch of coastline between Ellwood and Coal Oil Point, since 2001. In winter, the population of snowy plovers can number around 400 birds. It is the largest aggregation of its kind in all of the United States.† ""We thought ""î we hoped ""î to get some plovers to nest here again. And now we have an average of 35 [pairs] during the breeding season. So, it's an amazing result to get,""ù said Cristina Sandoval, director of Coal Oil Point Reserve.† Sands has technically been a protected beach since 1970, as part of the larger Coal Oil Point Reserve encompassing much of the lands surrounding Devereux Slough. However, there were little protections in place for the snowy plovers on the beach until the establishment of the program.† A number of developments led to increased protections for the plovers. Sandoval, the former co-manager of Coal Oil Point Reserve with her husband Kevin Lafferty, became the new official director of the reserve in 2001.† Alongside this was the fortuitous appearance of successful nesting snowy plovers near Sands Beach at the mouth of Devereux Slough in 2001, first sighted by Sandoval and Adrian O'Loghlen, a researcher at UCSB. This caused a resurgence in research and conservation interest regarding the plovers and Sands Beach, resulting in the creation of a docent program. The Santa Barbara Audubon Society also worked to provide funds and docents to protect snowy plover chicks.† In 2004, the first management plan for Coal Oil Point Reserve was written by Sandoval with the help of UCSB faculty, intended to address issues like unleashed dogs, trespassing and the conservation interests of the western snowy plover. Since then, the program has only grown.† ""When we started, I didn't even have a salary ""¶ and I didn't have any staff. Now we have a plover coordinator that is full time dedicated to the snowy plovers. We also have a lot more docents and volunteers that cover the beach, basically, seven days a week,""ù Sandoval said.† A challenge since the program was established has been balancing recreational access to Sands Beach with the interests of the plovers, who are sensitive to a number of human activities.† ""Really what I manage is people. That's the main factor that we really need to control to bring this species back from low numbers. The reason the plover numbers declined in the last several decades is because of uncontrolled recreation, beach grooming and development on the beach,""ù Sandoval said.† In particular, dogs ""î and especially unleashed dogs ""î have been a perpetual challenge to the conservation interests of the snowy plover. Unleashed dogs cause plovers to become, at best,† stressed. At worst, plovers can be chased and harassed, even mauled, by dogs. Research by Lafferty, in fact, has shown that they cause 10 times the amount of disturbance that humans cause.† However, despite these challenges, the program has succeeded in protecting the plovers and ensuring their survival, all while still largely allowing access to the beach. ""From studying the plovers here, at Coal Oil Point, we thought we could achieve that balance. But it's all very site specific. It worked here but may not work on other beaches,""ù Sandoval said.† On Tuesday, Sept. 21,, the program, in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Zoo, released nine snowy plovers back into their natural habitat, as it has periodically done for the past two decades. ""Most of the plovers that are rehabilitated in the zoo came from eggs. A high tide, for instance, could wash the eggs away, so we check the nests every two days. [After a high tide,] we watch for eggs that have been washed away from the nest, maybe a few feet away,""ù Sandoval said.† At 9 a.m., docents with Coal Oil Point Reserve and their collaborators brought forth chicks which they had been rehabilitating and incubating at the Santa Barbara Zoo.† The docents and their collaborators with the zoo wait as the plovers become accustomed to their new environment. Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus Initially nestled in little crates, the plovers were then incrementally moved to slightly larger cages following their arrival to the beach. From within their enclosure, they could see the entire coast and, somewhat closer, the fenced-off portion of Sands where dozens of their fellow snowy plovers roam, rest and nest.† Then, the docents and their collaborators with the zoo wait. Eagerly, they watch as their plovers grow more accustomed to their new surroundings and become less stressed and agitated. The flowers, the sand, the sea spray and the slough become once again ingrained in the plover's memory.†† After two or three hours, the plovers are liberated; their cages are opened and the docents and others watch ""î with barely concealed jubilation ""î as the birds walk out onto the beach and return from whence they came months before.† For Sandoval, such occasions serve as a reminder of the successes of the conservation program at Sands Beach, which has since been emulated at other beaches in both the north and south.† ""That moment when you're able to release a species that is threatened with extinction and know that you're putting one more individual out in nature ""î it's very rewarding,""ù Sandoval said. ""Working with conservation is very hard work ""î and it's stressful ""î so when we have a success story, it really gives you hope for doing more of it.""ù† Comments are closed.

Luca Disbrow / Daily Nexus Within just a few minutes of leaving my dorm, my hair simultaneously wilts and expands. Unfortunately, I can't explain it better. We live near several forms of water (lagoons, small pools of piss on DP and the Pacific Ocean), and much of that water evaporates into our atmosphere. Our hair, specifically the chemical compounds it consists of and its high porosity, is extremely attractive to atmospheric hydrogen. So attractive, in fact, that a strand of hair served as one of the earliest forms of a hygrometer, which is an instrument meant to measure humidity.† As hydrogen molecules bond between the keratin proteins in a single hair strand, it swells and folds in on itself. Multiply this by 100,000, which is the average number of hairs a human has on their head, and you've got a grievous case of the frizz. People with hair that tends to be drier or generally more porous fall especially severe victims, because more hydrogen molecules are able to infiltrate the spaces between those keratin strands.

While most people who have interactions with bears leave unscathed, negative interactions with bears make conservation more difficult and people and communities less safe.† Rae Wynn-Grant, a researcher with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, recently collaborated with researchers throughout New York state to model and map human-black bear interactions throughout the mountain range. The researchers found that most of the encounters happened in the urban-wildlife interface ""î away from both urban landscapes and dense forestland ""î where development has increasingly encroached on the Catskills in recent years. A Generational Conflict of Interest Finding consensus in climate policy is hard, especially globally. What do the rich and poor ""î or young and old ""î stand to lose or gain from aggressive climate policies? Haozhe Yang and Sangwon Suh, researchers at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, attempt to answer that question with a generational deep-dive into the economic costs and benefits of climate change mitigation over the course of a lifetime. The researchers found that those born prior to 1960 will experience a reduction in their gross domestic product per capita with climate change mitigation, while those born after 1990 will gain net benefits, although only in low-income countries. Although it might seem inconceivable to students at UC Santa Barbara, many high-income countries experienced zero net economic benefits from mitigation, regardless of what age they looked at.† The Future of Farming As demand in food rises globally, the world must navigate a landscape of increasingly degraded soil and increasing weather variability due to climate change. As a response to these forecasts, a† number of solutions are emerging to combat the food insecurity of the future. Intercropping, in which two or more crops coexist in the same space on an intermingled plot, has been shown to increase yields. However, whether or not intercropping is sustainable has been more of an open question. David Tilman, a researcher with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, collaborated with researchers at a number of Chinese universities to investigate this. With a few decade-long experiments, the researchers learned that intercropping increases yields and makes them more stable from year to year. In fact, it likely also increases soil fertility.

""It is a big recognition of my recent research work.""ù Zhou cites his systematic works on the global variational theory of constant mean curvature surfaces and his proof of the ""Multiplicity One Conjecture""ù of minimal surfaces as what led to his appointment as a speaker at ICM. Essentially, Zhou's work aims to better understand how surfaces work in our universe, be it the curvature of a soap bubble or the surface of a black hole.† Zhou notably developed the existence theory of constant mean curvature surfaces and the existence theory of minimal surfaces with free boundary. For his achievements, he received the NSF Career Award and the Alfred P.

science,The Psychological Science Behind Pseudoscience,8-Oct-21,8:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-08/the-psychological-science-behind-pseudoscience/,"Not everything humans believe is reflected in science. There is a whole other world beyond the sciences, populated by widespread ideas about religiosity, superstition, conspiracy theories and many others which ""î besides being unsupported by science ""î often exist in contradiction with science. Why might one assume that the stars and planets impact our temperament? Luca Disbrow / Daily Nexus ""The pervasiveness of pseudoscience is interesting to me, and the fact that some pseudosciences can be really dangerous and damaging,""ù said Spencer Mermelstein, a researcher in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences. How do these pseudoscientific beliefs, as they are called, spread and come to be accepted by many as fact?† Prior research supports the idea that many pseudoscientific beliefs spread because of the mind's architecture and intuitions. If a belief runs in line with our inborn assumptions and manners of thinking it will spread. ""It turns out that a lot of research shows that even really young kids have strong expectations about how things in the world work. So even really young kids expect that well, for instance, objects can only be in one place at one time, and really young kids expect that people can sometimes be wrong about things,""ù Mermelstein said.† For instance, many of those who hold anti-vaccine beliefs, according to Mermelstein, do so because of human beings' innate aversion to putting foreign or unfamiliar things in their body. It stems, then, from an ""overextension of the disgust response,""ù the same intuitions which lead one to avoid things like rotting food.† In a similar manner, those who believe the Earth is flat, as opposed to a sphere, have a belief that is grounded in a child's early-development understanding of the world based on what they observe in their everyday life, as opposed to what they know after receiving some form of education.† Then, there are other, more profound pseudoscientific beliefs, such as those seen among many religious people. For example, intelligent design ""î the belief that life on Earth must have been conceived by a supernatural entity ""î is often grounded in the human tendency to find patterns and purpose in random noise.† In fact, much research centered on pseudoscientific beliefs looks to developmental psychology to explain some of these phenomena.† ""So, if you asked kids like, ""òHey, why are there mountains over there?' they'll say, ""òWell, it's for the animals to scratch their backs.' They see something complex, and they intuit that there must be a purpose to it,""ù Mermelstein said.† ""And so that's kind of a predisposition that makes something like intelligent design appealing. So those are a set of pseudoscientific beliefs that have their basis on these reliably developing cognitive predispositions, or intuitions.""ù†† However, there are some popular beliefs that don't quite fit that mold. Mermelstein has sought to understand why this is and how these beliefs spread.† ""What we point out is that there are certain pseudosciences out there that contain these very counterintuitive elements. [These] kind of challenge the idea that pseudosciences are popular because they kind of latch on to existing ways of thinking,""ù Mermelstein said. Specifically, Mermelstein points to astrology and parapsychology ""î the study of things like clairvoyance, telepathy and telekinesis ""î as two relatively widespread beliefs which, as he describes, aren't really compatible with our assumptions and inferences about the world around us.† After all, why might one assume that the stars and planets impact our temperament and fortunes, and why might one assume that one can move things with their mind? ""You can even drive down the street in Goleta and see that there are psychic fortune teller offices, for lack of a better word. These are pervasive to popular belief systems and again also across time and across culture,""ù Mermelstein said.† Mermelstein argues that the reason these beliefs and other similar ones exist is because of a few things in particular. One, the degree to which they are inconsistent with our intuitions also serves to make them striking and memorable. Two, because of this distinctiveness, people are more drawn to have discussions about these counterintuitive beliefs in an attempt to reconcile them with their existing knowledge and in turn, spread them around through conversation.† In addition, unlike beliefs like vaccine hesitancy, there may be some sort of barrier between endorsing a counterintuitive belief like astrology and actually letting one's belief affect their behavior in a meaningful way.† As Mermelstein puts it, ""That might be something unique to these sorts of counterintuitive concepts. We can say we believe in them, but do they actually impact our everyday life?""ù A version of this article appeared on p.15 of the October 7, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Since that point, the fire has burned thousands of acres across the range, prompting the county to declare a state of emergency and necessitating the closure of all four lanes of the U.S. 101 Highway past Cathedral Oaks Road.† Daniela Gomez / Daily Nexus From the human perspective, the Alisal Fire, which threatens communities, buildings and other important infrastructure, is certainly a menace. However, for the flora and fauna which call the land home, is it a ""good fire,""ù which is largely beneficial, or a ""bad fire,""ù from which the landscape will have a hard time recovering?† Like much of the American West, chaparral ""î the community of woody, evergreen shrubs which comprise much of the Santa Ynez Mountains ""î is primed to burn at particular intervals. Chaparral is found all throughout California and beyond, ranging from southern Oregon to Northern Mexico and even inland in the mountainous regions of Arizona. Unlike some other dry forests and woodlands, which burn regularly at a low intensity, chaparral burns fiercely and infrequently, at an interval within the realm of 30 to 150 years. These ""crown fires,""ù as they are called, obliterate much of the plant life on a landscape.† Then, however, comes the return of spring and a vigorous resprouting of the chaparral with the help of a well-developed seed bank ""î the seeds which naturally accumulate in the soil over time. Unfortunately, too-frequent fire in the chaparral, which is what has been observed in much of Southern California, makes the chaparral vulnerable to infiltration from invasive species, like cheatgrasses and mustard. There are many causes of this, including the increasing severity of multi-year droughts and the encroachment of the chaparral biome by humans and development, which leads to more fire starts.† Because of this, much of the chaparral in Southern California is in danger of becoming grassland. The land burning in the Alisal Fire has not burned for over half a century, which is plenty of time to establish a seed bank on the landscape. However, it is flanked by land which has burned recently, notably the footprint of the Whittier Fire, which burned a large swath of land south of Lake Cachuma in 2017.† So is the Alisal Fire a ""good fire""ù or a ""bad fire?""ù Well, it depends on where it burns in the coming days.

The goal of the project, made possible by the grant awarded to Valentine and her team of four other scientists, is to create a design framework to accelerate the design, manufacturing and use of autonomous biotic-abiotic biomaterials.† Courtesy of Megan Valentine ""I've had informal interactions with members of our team for years, and we have been thinking about how to combine our collective expertise to create new classes of materials that can perform complex tasks, like crawling and lifting,""ù Valentine said. ""I am very excited for the opportunity to pursue this work, which I anticipate will lead to new foundational knowledge of how living materials perform complex tasks, while enabling new applications in healthcare and robotics.""ù The team consists of five faculty researchers from UCSB, the University of Chicago, Syracuse University, Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of San Diego. Of the five members, four are women, including Valentine.† ""I hope that through this award we can both elevate the visibility of women in science and engineering disciplines and lower the barriers for anyone to work with next-generation biomaterials,""ù Valentine said.† According to Valentine, the work of the team builds on a number of prior successes in her lab concerning protein- and polymer-based materials. Their project seeks to create biotic-abiotic devices that harness bacteria cells and protein-based motors to power hydrogel actuators. According to Materials Today on ScienceDirect Magazine, hydrogel actuators are 3D polymer networks filled with water. The level of water in these networks changes based on external stimuli, such as temperature and light exposure, and is meant to mimic how plants are able to move and twist through varying the amount of water in cells and tissues.† ""Organisms and living tissues can do incredible things ""î move, respond to stimuli, adapt and heal,""ù Valentine said. ""By contrast, most man-made materials are pretty simple and are typically optimized to a single task. Through this project, we will develop methods to incorporate living cells into hydrogels in order to capture the adaptive and multifunctional properties of living materials in robust engineering materials.""ù Valentine said this can have broad uses in healthcare, packaging and robotics. To approach this project, the main methods that will be used at UC Santa Barbara[[UCSB]] specifically are high-resolution microscopy, 3D printing, cell culture and micromechanical testing of bio-hydrogel materials. Valentine's main role in the project is leading the hydrogel design work and the development of the methods for mechanical characterization of the device prototypes.† ""This involves understanding how the hydrogel will respond to stretching, how it will interact with cells and proteins, and how we can optimize the coupling between the biological and manmade elements to improve the ability of the materials and devices to change shape, lift and move,""ù Valentine said.† According to Valentine, the team's collective expertise ranges from genetics and molecular biology to protein biophysics and materials science to advanced modeling and instrument development. ""By bringing together experts in theory, computation, bioenabled manufacturing, experimental characterization and design, we can tackle bigger scientific questions than any member could answer alone,""ù Valentine said. ""I am looking forward to collaborating with a team of experts to establish frontier materials of biomaterials science and synthetic biology and am eager to see what new solutions and creative synergies emerge.""ù When Valentine was awarded a Fulbright Scholar award to collaborate at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in 2015, she said the importance of female science teachers and female S.T.E.M. faculty in higher education who can serve as role models and mentors was often emphasized. Equally emphasized was the importance of encouraging students to do hands-on experiments, such as building equipment, exploring robotics and coding.† So, team-driven science, Valentine said, and a research atmosphere that promotes and rewards open exchange, creativity, risk-taking and cooperation to push the boundaries of scientific discovery is one that she works hard to create. She plans to recruit and supervise students who will gain hands-on training in cutting-edge biomaterials research.† ""The grant will provide opportunities for training students in how to incorporate biological circuits and elements into designer materials and then the deployment of those materials in useful devices that can move, grab and lift,""ù Valentine said. ""This type of interdisciplinary training will help the students and postdocs who work on the project become the next generation of leaders in engineering and materials science.""ù

""The College of Engineering tends to be smaller than others in the university, and so it's not easy for people that are underrepresented to do well and feel like they belong,""ù said Danny Hernandez, co-president of Los Ingenieros and fourth-year electrical engineering major.† For decades, Los Ingenieros has sought to create a community for those students, providing resources and a platform for those in engineering and other S.T.E.M. fields who must navigate the rigors of academics, internships and professional networking ""î† challenges which can be especially difficult in an environment where very few peers share their experiences.† ""By surrounding ourselves with people that come from the same backgrounds, we kind of get the motivation ""î to not only push each other ""î but also to help encounter future leaders of S.T.E.M. that come from the same underrepresented communities.""ù Los Ingenieros, for instance, hosts the mentorship program L@s Guias, which pairs upperclassmen with underclassmen to help new students navigate university life, careers and academics more broadly.† In addition, the organization hosts professional workshops and networking events ""î such as industry tours, where Los Ingenieros members visit a variety of S.T.E.M. companies, including Google, Boeing and Hewlett-Packard. Los Ingenieros also sends students to multiple academic and professional conferences, like the National Institute for Leadership Advancement. However, the organization started off small. The founding members of Los Ingenieros first met in scattered apartments throughout Isla Vista in 1978. Nine Latino engineering students came together to form a small support group, assisting one another in their academic and professional endeavors and developing skills for the workplace and beyond. They wanted to provide a space for themselves that UCSB at the time did not. ""The initial objective was helping out the Hispanic community in S.T.E.M.,""ù Hernandez said. ""Los Ingenieros was made for people, especially those in the community where they didn't have the exposure coming out of high school to be able to thrive.""ù Through spreading meetings from apartments to El Centro Arnulfo Casillas and eventually to the Engineering Science Building at UCSB, Los Ingenieros continued to become further ingrained in the university. In the 1990s, the organization became an official student chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), putting them in contact with more professional engineers and community leaders. Since then, the organization has grown and become a mainstay of the UCSB community. It has even won many accolades over the years, including the Student Organization of the Year award in 1998-99, 2001-02, 2008-09 and 2010-11. Recently, in 2018, Los Ingenieros also was recognized as the ""Best Small Chapter of the Year""ù by SHPE. The organization also, however, gives back to the broader community. For instance, Los Ingenieros has worked closely with the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (M.E.S.A.) program to host Science & Technology M.E.S.A. Day, an engineering competition held for hundreds of sixth- to 12th-grade students in the local community.† At present, the organization is in the midst of preparing for a major conference: the 2021 SHPE National Convention, set to be held in Orlando, Florida, from Nov. 10-14. Described as the largest gathering of Hispanics in S.T.E.M., there are expected to be over 6,000 attendees and more than 250 exhibitions. The convention will serve, as Los Ingenieros does on campus, as an opportunity to connect, network, find opportunities, learn skills and feel like a part of a community.† ""[We're] really, really welcoming. Especially now, all the officers are really nice and welcoming ""¶ We feel like they don't see people that look like them within the College of Engineering, and so, you know, we try to be as inclusive as possible,""ù Hernandez said. ""That's one of the biggest things; we're big on being a support system and trying to give all of our members an opportunity to make friends and meet new people.""ù†

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,21-Oct-21,6:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-21/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-2/,"Luca Disbrow / Daily Nexus Dry and dirty† Soil is quite dynamic, fluctuating physically, chemically and microbially in response to changing environmental conditions. There's a wide array of natural processes that underpin soil behavior, notably the drying and rewetting of soil which occur with the onset of drought and rain, respectively. However, despite the ubiquity of this process, research looking at soil often does not take into account these natural fluctuations, instead carrying out experiments in unchanging, ""steady-state""ù conditions.† Oliver Chadwick, a professor in the department of environmental studies at UC Santa Barbara, has recently sought to understand how soil rewetting and drying impacts phosphorus cycling at the isotopic level. Looking at soils on the Kohala peninsula in Hawaii and subjecting them to a five-month drying-rewetting treatment, Chadwick and his collaborators found that drying-rewetting treatments increased phosphorus exchange through inorganic processes while decreasing biological phosphorus cycling as microbial activity relatedly declined.† Fish scales From the 1800s to the present, the land and sea have undergone a remarkable transformation. Swathes of land have been developed, cleared, burned and tilled in the name of human welfare and development. Elsewhere in the ocean, similarly magnitudinous but often overlooked, developments have even led to changes in the biogeochemistry of the ocean.† Timothy DeVries, a researcher in the UCSB Department of Geography who is working with researchers from elsewhere in the UC system, as well as from Montreal and Barcelona, has conducted research hoping to better understand how one factor in particular, global fish biomass, has changed in response to increased pressure from fishing. The researchers found that from the pre-exploitation era to the 1990s, the biomass of fish in the ocean has been reduced by ""nearly half,""ù with a corresponding decline in the rate of biogeochemical cycling.† Family first One troubling thing academics and clinicians often find in psychological training and the associated clinical approaches in the university setting is the homogeneity, with the values of the university often only taking into account the ""middle-class norms and values""ù of the United States. This can be a significant roadblock to students who hail from more collectivist cultures, which place less of an emphasis on personal growth and instead emphasize one's duty to their family. After all, how can one prioritize schooling when those in their community or family find themselves in distress?† In response to this, Natalie A. Larez and Jill D. Sharkey, researchers with the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education at UCSB, have created a conceptual model with the hope of providing psychology trainees with better ways of balancing familial obligations and the rigors and expectations of psychology training programs. The model also aims to instruct graduate training programs on how to better equip these students themselves.† Comments are closed.

science,Thinking Globally and Acting Locally: Ian Shive and the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network Celebrate New Hospital,22-Oct-21,12:00 PM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-22/thinking-globally-and-acting-locally-ian-shive-and-the-santa-barbara-wildlife-care-network-celebrate-new-hospital/,"This past Friday, Oct. 15, the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network hosted their annual Benefit for Wildlife. Their goal this year was to raise money for their new Wildlife Hospital in Goleta, set to be completed by the end of 2021. The fundraiser, which took place at the Carousel House downtown, welcomed some of the region's most influential residents and supporters of the Network, including one of its newest board members: renowned nature photographer and filmmaker Ian Shive. Welcomed by Executive Director Ariana Katovich, guests had a chance to celebrate the hospital's construction, support the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network (SBWCN) and enjoy the late summer evening with live music and delicious food. The SBWCN was formed in 1988 by a group of residents of the Santa Barbara area who saw an urgent need for wildlife rescue and rehabilitation in the local community. According to the SBWCN's website, their vision consists of providing ""quality rescue, treatment, rehabilitation, and release services""ù to animals in need in the area, educating the public about ""the needs of at-risk wildlife [and] the challenges faced by wildlife in the region,""ù as well as collecting and sharing information with other partners. Three decades later, the SBWCN works with dozens of volunteers every day and helps thousands of animals each year. As the SBWCN's website says, the new hospital will have ""the capacity to save and serve thousands of lives.""ù† A digital rendering of the new SBWCN Hospital. Courtesy of SBWCN There was good reason for Shive to be at Friday's event. Shive is an author, photographer, filmmaker and conservationist, whose most recent works include the Discovery+ series ""The Last Unknown""ù (2021),† an insider's look at the National Wildlife Refuge System, including the vast and remote Aleutian Islands, ""Hidden Pacific""ù (2019), a film profiling the islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean, and the book ""Refuge: America's Wildest Places""ù (2020), a collection of photographs from various National Wildlife Refuges around the globe.† Shive has also spent many years travelling to and working in Santa Barbara and got involved with the SBWCN about a year ago. Shive said taking action at the local level is important to him, and an opportunity to get involved with an organization whose mission and values aligned with his own was particularly motivating. In August, he became a member of the SBWCN's board of directors and continues to be a significant supporter of the Network and the Santa Barbara community. A baby opossum being examined under the care of the SBWCN Courtesy of SBWCN As to how he first got into photography and film, Shive said it happened gradually. Growing up in an urban environment meant that from a young age he had a firm appreciation for the outdoors, and early on he also developed a passion for photography and film. Over time he put the two together and started using photography as a means to educate audiences about the beauty and importance of nature.† Rather than an environmental activist, Shive considers himself to be simply a representative of the natural world and an educator.† ""Who am I to say that this is what you should do? But I can definitely show you what [the situation] is,""ù Shive said. ""I want people to get [to the opinion that the environment is worth protecting] on their own, because maybe they see it a different way than I do.""ù† However, even though he strongly believes in the power of film as a means to communicate the beauty of these last wild places to the public, Shive said he also has his concerns about the implications of his travel.† ""We're sort of at an inflection point with outdoor recreation ""¶ and the truth is, I look at a lot of places and I say ""òI probably shouldn't go there.'""ù Shive then followed up this comment with a question: ""Are we caring [these places] to death?""ù† Shive also discussed the current pressing environmental issues affecting the local Santa Barbara area, such as wildfires and oil spills, and what they signify in terms of the future of the natural world.† Ian Shive (right), with camera operator Dante Fernandes in the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Courtesy of Ian Shive ""It feels like we're at a tipping point of sorts,""ù Shive said, ""As a person who's lived outdoors all their life, I've never had so many closures, so many things preventing me from being outside [""¶] The threats are real.""ù† While the rapid rise of average global air temperature and all of the resulting climate crises may make it seem like there is no way to stop our path of destruction, Shive said he remains hopeful. ""We have to have hope,""ù Shive said. ""Am I confident that everything we do [to solve the issues] will work? Of course not, I mean I'm not delusional. But am I hopeful? Of course [""¶] If there's no hope, there's nothing else.""ù Regarding the role of government in wildlife conservation, Shive can speak from experience. He has both collaborated with governmental agencies, such as the U.S. National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, and lobbied Congress against certain actions that may have an adverse effect on the environment and biodiversity, including the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.† ""Can we expect that they're going to do everything for us? No. Can we ask and demand that they make certain changes that we are unable to make as individuals? Yes.""ù Shive said. ""It's a complicated equation, [""¶] we have to ask them to do certain things and we need to do certain things as individuals, and also as a collective.""ù† He went on to say that while it's easy to point fingers and assign blame at every level, it is important to understand that the way in which the government is constructed makes it impossible for government agencies to do anything without consulting and getting authorization from Congress or the president.† ""The lack of faith in the government that young people have is absolutely justified. But what I love about the young people today is that they're going to be the leaders of tomorrow. So hopefully it's not too late.""ù† When asked if he has any advice for young people who want to have a career in conservation or get involved with environmentalism, Shive suggested starting closer to home.† A Northern fur seal making a guttural growl. Courtesy of Ian Shive ""I'm lucky that I got to go do these big things, but honestly I started local. Everyone starts local.""ù Shive said. ""And in fact you may never go anywhere else, and that's amazing, because local is so relevant.""ù† Shive said working at a local level is a great place to start because it's where we have the best ability to make a real difference.† ""There's nothing better than going to an animal hospital, like the one that's just been built here at the Care Network and say[ing] ""òHere's all of the hundreds of creatures that are coming in and that are going to be rehabilitated and put back out. To me, that's a very tangible thing.""ù† For budding photographers and filmmakers, his advice is: ""Don't buy an expensive plane ticket to go to Africa and watch the wildebeest migration [""¶] By the time you get on the plane and get there and spend thousands of dollars, how much are you really going to see and do? But if you go down to the ocean every night and photograph the same pond, the same egrets that are feeding on these fish, you can sit there and really hone your craft.""ù† ""Whether you're a biologist or [""¶] a director or a member of a non-profit, like the Care Network, I think it's all sort of similar,""ù he said, ""It's access; local means access, and access means we can get better at [what we do].""ù†† † Comments are closed.

science,River Flows Across You: Game Theory in the Harirud Basin,28-Oct-21,8:00 AM,"['Sean Crommelin', 'Audrey Pham']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-28/river-flows-across-you-game-theory-in-the-harirud-basin/,"Many of the greatest rivers of the world, like the Rio Grande, demarcate the boundaries between countries. Rivers make up a staggering 23% of international borders. A map of the Harirud River Basin, which flows through Afghanistan, Iran and Turkmenistan. Courtesy of Hugo Loaiciga Meanwhile, others like the Tigris and Euphrates wind their way to the ocean with no regard for international boundaries. Undeterred by customs and immigration, their fluvial flow runs from one territory to the next, oblivious to their incredible geopolitical influence. Sometimes they align with international borders, other times not whatsoever. Even within a river system, incredible ecological, political and geographic variety is found.† These transboundary rivers, as they are called, are much more than a water source. They are places of development and power generation, they define cultural identity and they can serve as sources of conflict and leverage in equal measure. More often than not, they become the subject of sometimes intense negotiations.† ""There are many, many transboundary basins. You know about the geopolitics in between Israel and the Palestinians, right? They, for instance, have some shared water resources that are very conflicting,""ù said Hugo Loaiciga, a hydrologist with the UC Santa Barbara Department of Geography.† Particularly in the wake of intensifying climate change, the role of transboundary rivers in regional politics ""î and the damming and diverting of them ""î has fueled tensions around the world. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is another example, a $5 billion project which remains an object of contention among Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.† Loaiciga and his collaborators, including researchers at the University of Tehran and Texas A&M University, have long sought to understand the broader geopolitics of the region encompassing Afghanistan, Iran and Turkmenistan.† In this most recent research, they have placed a microscope over the Harirud River Basin ""î or Herat River. The Harirud flows west from the snow-capped peaks of the Hindu Kush. From this origin, the river traverses Afghanistan, Iran and Turkmenistan before disappearing into the sands of the Karakum Desert.†† These largely arid regions rely heavily on irrigation, making these finite water resources doubly important. In addition, the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan has further complicated the picture. As recently as August, Taliban fighters launched an attack on the Afghan-India Friendship Dam in Herat, which provides water and power to hundreds of thousands of people.† Using machine learning and evolutionary game theory to analyze the long-term water-sharing strategies of the countries encompassing the basin, the researchers sought to find evolutionary stable strategies, which are persistent and cannot be changed or overcome by other strategies in a game that is played repeatedly.† ""Imagine you're playing poker with four people and nobody knows what you're doing. These countries can be a similar model. Their behavior towards sharing water resources can be posed as a game theory problem ""î then you [can] solve them based on their particular characteristics,""ù Loaiciga said.† ""You are involved in a situation where there are several people who are interested in the same thing. And so all of you are vying to get as much as possible from that resource.""ù† In other words, the researchers used game theory to find the strategies among the different players which would net the most mutual benefits.† With this, the researchers found that the evolutionarily stable strategy was the one in which the upstream country ""î which generally has more leverage than the downstream countries and more incentive not to cooperate ""î gets more benefits and incentives from cooperating than from not cooperating.† So, what specifically does this mean for Afghanistan, Iran and Turkmenistan?† ""The one strategy that will provide the greatest benefits for the three countries is one where Iran pays for Afghanistan to reduce their withdrawal of water in their own country and allow Iran to make use of it,""ù Loaiciga said.† ""That's the one strategy that will generate less conflict and that will produce the greatest gain because Iran has very active agriculture, so even though they are paying money to Afghanistan, they then take the water, and they produce a lot of agricultural products.""ù ""Meanwhile, Turkmenistan uses very little water. The best thing for them is to basically keep using the same water that they sporadically get because they have a very small agricultural economy and they only use a small amount of water for urban supply.""ù Comments are closed.

This land contributes to individual and community well-being. Forests supply water, regulate climate, serve as places of recreation and supply hundreds of thousands of jobs in the state. Without forests, life would look very different.† A view of Haddock Peak from Reyes Peak. The highest mountain on Pine Mountain Ridge, Reyes Peak is a rarity in Los Padres: a mountain crowned by stands of pine and cedar. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus For several different reasons, deforestation and forest degradation are realities, and one example lies on a mountain ridge about 80 miles from UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista: Pine Mountain. The controversy of Pine Mountain remains six months in the making. This mountain ridge stretches six miles in Ventura County, in Los Padres National Forest, and is currently threatened by a logging project.† †The project was initiated in 2018. The United States Forest Service spearheaded the project under former President Trump, and now the Biden administration has it under review. The logging will generate approximately 3.8 million board feet of timber, leading to an unmistakable boost to the economy.† The project threatens 755 acres of conifer forest and chaparral and aims to remove ""small""ù trees up to two feet in diameter, though the proposal endangers trees up to five feet in diameter through loopholes in the writing. These loopholes also allow the logging proposal to progress without a detailed investigation into the area or a chance for the public to share their thoughts on the project, which is just what the U.S. Forest Service has done. Pine Mountain is home to incredible biological diversity. It is inhabited by species of plants and animals unique to the region, such as lupine and scarlet bugler wildflowers, and native wildlife species, such as the California black bear and the California red-tailed hawk.† Less well-known, however, is the fact that the land is of incredible significance to the Chumash of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, who see the mountain as part of their homeland and an integral aspect of their history and heritage. The proposal states that this forest clearing initiative is necessary and beneficial. They claim that clearing this ""dead""ù vegetation will prevent forest fires. However, many researchers and conservationists question this, instead advocating for other initiatives, such as building with fire-safe material, preventing development in at-risk areas and constructing safe areas next to homes. †These methods have been proven to be more effective. For instance, the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB responded to the disastrous 2017 fires with procedures that included adding fire-safe material to current homes, supporting an alternative and viable future and ridding communities of existing encouragement to occupy fire-hazard zones.† A write-up by the many organizations opposing the project, including the Los Padres ForestWatch, the Center for Biological Diversity and the John Muir Project, states that the project fails to review the best research and also lists no specific goals for the plan. These groups cite their issues with the project and also propose better and more effective tactics in preserving and protecting the forest. †Instead, citizens took to the internet in frustration, generating tens of thousands of comments, overwhelmingly in opposition. The commenters range from civilians to protest organizers to professors ""î all backing the cause. For instance, the UCSB Climbing Team took to Instagram to show their objection to the logging plan.† Island View Outfitters, a clothing and accessory company run by UCSB alumni, has merchandise that reads ""Save Pine Mountain""ù and ""Protect Pine Mountain Ridge.""ù Proceeds are donated to the Los Padres ForestWatch, a long-standing nonprofit organization that aims to preserve and protect the Los Padres National Forest.† Further south, in Ventura and Ojai, local politicians have wielded their own leverage. Earlier in October, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 in opposition of the logging project in Pine Mountain. The week after, the Ojai City Council voted unanimously to officially oppose the project.† Despite overwhelming public opposition, the U.S. Forest Service insists that it will continue with the logging project in Pine Mountain. Nearby, more projects are slated to commence, such as a logging proposal that threatens 1,600 acres of land in Mount Pinos.

science,UCSB Professor Urges Centrality of Women in Biomedical Research,4-Nov-21,11:30 PM,['Maya Ades'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-04/ucsb-professor-urges-centrality-of-women-in-biomedical-research/,"There is a lack of gender equity in STEM ""î and a lack of female representation in biomedical research. Dr. Emily Jacobs, a professor and researcher in the psychological and brain sciences department at UC Santa Barbara, has a lot to say about it. As part of the Pacific Views Speaker Series, Jacobs gave a lecture last week in the library entitled, ""The Uncharted Mind ""î The Scientific Body of Knowledge: Whose Body Does it Serve?""ù Jacobs, pictured above, closed with a call to action for the biomedical research community. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus Jacobs started off by talking about the lack of gender equity in the sciences. Women are systematically left out of science, and it starts at the kindergarten age. Research has found that from the age of 6, children of both sexes will pick a picture of a male when asked the question, ""Who is a scientist?""ù† As Jacobs describes, there are implicit biases and stereotypes that start affecting children at very young ages, which stops girls from joining the field of science. There are few women in these fields to begin with, and the few that make it are weeded out by improper hiring practices and pay imbalances. Female scientists are often not hired for jobs that they are qualified for, they are granted less money for labs and there is a systematic pay gap between female and male scientists. According to Jacobs, half of all female scientists in the U.S. leave after having their first child. ""[These women] are not leaving because they are not good enough for their job. They are leaving because the job is not good enough for them.""ù Beyond the consequences for individual women, Jacobs further emphasized how leaving women out of science ""isn't just about the cost to women, but it is about the cost to the world.""ù ""Advocating for diversity in science isn't just a matter of social justice. It's not just the right thing to do. Diversity in science makes science better. It drives innovation, it challenges the status quo and it changes the very nature of the questions we seek to ask. The reason for diversity transcends the moral imperative,""ù† Jacobs said. Similarly, in animal studies seeking to test medications and better understand human conditions, researchers overwhelmingly focus on males. This is even true in studies on conditions that are more dominant in female humans, such as depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's. Jacobs said that these conditions and medicines are tested and studied on male bodies, which obviously behave very differently from female bodies.† As Jacobs puts it, ""most of what we know about health and disease is centered on the male body,""ù which can be very dangerous for women. Male bodies should not be considered the norm in science. Even arguments for why this is standard practice don't hold up to scrutiny, Jacobs said. The variability of a female's menstrual cycle, for instance, has often been cited as the reason why female rodents are not used in medical trials. This, however, has been debunked, as male species have complicated hormones too, meaning that female lab rats are not less variable than males.† Currently, the Jacobs Lab at UCSB is studying healthy aging in women, specifically the menopausal transition. This has been dramatically overlooked in scientific studies before, and consequently very little is known about how menopause affects the brain. It may come as little surprise that there are few neuroscience studies on menopause, seeing as 80% of medical schools fail to include menopause in their curriculums. The Jacobs Lab is also studying the cycles of a woman's 28-day cycle, and how the brain adapts and changes to the influx of different hormones.† The Jacobs Lab is additionally expanding female neuroscience research beyond UCSB. The University of California Women's Brain Initiative, a women's brain imaging database, will be able to be used by any researchers studying the endocrinology of women's brains and has collection sites at both UCSB and UC Berkeley.† Jacobs closed with a call to action for the biomedical research community, a place which she knows too well is marked by the dominance of men. ""Now is the moment for women to claim themselves as central. We have got to claim the study of our bodies on our terms and to do that we need scientists and doctors whose vision isn't blurred by the lack of experience,""ù Jacobs said. ""I have spent the better part of a decade fighting for women's health to be taken as seriously as men's health in the biomedical sciences and there are incredible scientists working on this front, but we cannot do it alone. Biomedical research has overwhelmingly overlooked women's health. We are still struggling to understand fairly fundamental questions. We need more women in positions of power.""ù Comments are closed.

science,UCSB Ecologist Looks to AI To Improve Wildlife Camera Trapping,5-Nov-21,10:00 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-05/ucsb-ecologist-looks-to-ai-to-improve-wildlife-camera-trapping/,"Ecologist Kaitlyn Gaynor, a current postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara's National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, recently coauthored the research paper ""Iterative human and automated identification of wildlife images,""ù which explores the role of artificial intelligence, or AI, in the processing of data collected from camera traps. The data analyzed in this study was taken from a long-term camera trap project in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique and includes various photos of local flora and fauna.† The front of a roaming elephant captured by one of the researcher's camera traps. Courtesy of Kaitlyn Gaynor The study looks at how AI and human scientists can work together to improve both efficiency and accuracy in the processing of photographic data. It is anticipated that this ""synergistic collaboration""ù will yield high-confidence conclusions due to the checking of each other's work, ultimately leading to better quality results than either could provide on their own. The question of how to improve data analysis has been a major point of interest. ""I have been using camera traps to study the recovery of large mammals in Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park since 2016,""ù Gaynor said. ""And processing the photos has always been a big bottleneck.""ù The paper discusses how one of the biggest challenges to long-term camera trap monitoring is the sheer amount of human labor needed to annotate and analyze the camera trap data.† This is the second paper that Gaynor's colleague Zhongqi Miao, a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley, has led using this set of data. The first paper, published in 2019, looked at a deep learning algorithm that assigns importance to different aspects of each image in order to identify the object present in the photo. Deep learning is a type of AI that mimics methods of human knowledge acquisition, proving especially useful for when visual stimulus recognition is involved. ""Interestingly, this process revealed that the computer vision algorithm often clued in on different visual features of species than humans would, which improved its accuracy for cases when only part of the animal was visible,""ù Gaynor remarked.
 The new paper contributes significantly to what is already known about AI and its implications for use in ecological monitoring through the development of a system that ""integrates human expertise into the machine learning loop,""ù according to Gaynor. This type of approach has never been taken before, and she is excited about its implications for the future of wildlife research.† ""The algorithm assigns a confidence level to each classification, and low confidence predictions are flagged for further review,""ù Gaynor said. ""Subsequent identifications are then used to retrain the model. This ultimately results in a much lower amount of human labor than would be required for manual identification of every image, but a higher accuracy than could be achieved from the machine learning algorithm alone.""ù† For this paper, Gaynor and her colleague Meredith Palmer, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, were responsible for the data collection in the field and had to look at the 20% of the photos that had been classified by the AI algorithm as ""low confidence""ù in order to correct any photos that had been misidentified. ""This saved us significant time and resulted in high accuracy ""î around 90% of the images were classified correctly,""ù Gaynor said. ""Accuracy remains lower for the rare species, and we hope to get these numbers up higher with the addition of more data from future seasons and continued fine-tuning of the model.""ù A lion and cub captured by one of the researcher's camera traps. Courtesy of Kaitlyn Gaynor When asked about the most interesting or surprising findings of the research, Gaynor said, ""I was surprised at how accurate the computer vision algorithm was in cases when only part of the animal was visible, or otherwise hard to see. When we were testing this model on data that had already been classified, I took a closer look at some of the ""òincorrect' model classifications and found that the model was actually correct, and our initial classifications were wrong! The model often did a better job than we did.""ù

Regarding the future of artificial intelligence in wildlife monitoring and conservation, Gaynor said that ""machine learning methods will be critical for keeping pace with data processing and in the translation of raw data into usable information that can inform science and conservation.""ù The next step for Gaynor and her colleagues is to take the algorithm and translate it into simple and usable software that is accessible to researchers in the field, specifically in Gorongosa National Park. Additionally, Gaynor's team is working on getting ""citizen scientists""ù and other volunteers around the world to help identify animals in camera trap data and incorporating that into the AI-human collaborative approach. They hope to both provide a unique learning opportunity for the volunteers, as well as to create ""a workflow that is fast, efficient and educational.""ù Comments are closed.

science,UCSB Physics Professor Proposes New Planetary Defense System,14-Nov-21,11:22 PM,['Maddie Dewhirst'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-14/ucsb-physics-professor-proposes-new-planetary-defense-system/,"When people think of cosmic objects hitting Earth, their minds typically jump to calamities like the meteor that killed off the dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. However, the Earth is actually bombarded by about 100 tons of cosmic debris per day; the vast majority of it is just so small it is insignificant and burns up in the atmosphere. When the objects become bigger though, there are no robust defence systems currently protecting against these potential threats ""î this is the problem Professor Philip Lubin in the Department of Physics at UC Santa Barbara is trying to solve.† While Earth faces no current threats from asteroids or comets, a few asteroids are scheduled to make a close flyby in the coming decades. Courtesy of Pixabay Lubin began this research in 2015 before shelving it for five years and then resuming it during the pandemic. His work, along with that of his co researcher, Alexander Cohen, and various students assisting him, culminated in the project titled PI (œ""), or Pulverize It. The project proposes a way to break up incoming objects, instead of just deflecting them as past efforts have sought to do. The basic concept involves using penetrator rods in order to fragment the incoming asteroid or comet. The key is not to have all the fragments miss Earth but for them to be so small that they burn up in the atmosphere and the shock blasts are decorrelated (or spread out), making them so they pose little threat to life on the ground.† Lubin offers the analogy of a bulletproof vest, where the vest ""will take the damage from a bullet and spread it out over a significant region so that it doesn't hurt you too much.""ù What PI would do is ""break the bullet ""î or the asteroid ""î up into pieces, so each piece hits a different part of the atmosphere and the atmosphere then acts like our bulletproof vest.""ù This method has the advantage of being able to wait until much later to deal with an incoming problem. Deflection requires many months, if not years of work on detection and then changing the path of the object. PI would theoretically allow threats to be mitigated on a scale of minutes or days, depending on the size of the threat.† ""It is just a matter of time. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,""ù Lubin said, emphasizing the importance of planning ahead. ""Someday, those kinds of objects will hit us.""ù In the last 113 years, two meteors have been large enough to cause serious damage to the Earth, according to Lubin. A forested region in Siberia was decimated by a meteor in 1908 in what is known as the Tunguska Event. More recently in 2013, a meteor shattered over Chelyabinsk, Russia. Despite breaking apart in the atmosphere, the resulting shock wave was enough to cause major destruction, though not killing anyone.† While Earth faces no current threats from asteroids or comets, a few asteroids are scheduled to make a close flyby in the coming decades. On Friday the 13th of April 2029, the asteroid 99942 Apophis ""î which boasts a diameter of 370 meters and carries the equivalent energy of all the nuclear weapons on Earth ""î will pass within geosynchronous orbit, according to NASA. That is less than 32,000 kilometers, or 20,000 miles, away from the Earth's surface, closer than some of the planet's satellites. In 2135 the asteroid 101955 Bennu, 490 meters in diameter, will also come close to the planet.† Both of these asteroids are returners, meaning they will continue to pass by Earth every number of years. This opens up the possibility of the asteroids going through a gravitational keyhole, meaning that if an object passes by the Earth, the planet's gravity could affect the object's trajectory so that it will hit Earth on a future trip.† It is worth noting that neither Apophis or Bennu are extinction level threats. For reference, the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was approximately 10 kilometers wide. PI would allow a meteor the size of Apophis to be mitigated 10 days prior to impact, while about 60 days would be necessary to allay Bennu from hitting the planet in its current form. Smaller asteroids like the one that exploded above Chelyabinsk could be dealt with a mere 100 seconds prior to impact.† Lubin's work and that of his students is ongoing. The paper is currently being peer reviewed and students are continuing their work coding and designing simulations for various scenarios. Part of a team featuring several UCSB students and one high schooler, fourth-years Dharv Patel, a Physics major and Astronomy minor, and Hannah Shabtian, who is majoring in Earth Science with Geophysics Emphasis and minoring in Astronomy and Planetary Sciences and Iranian Studies, work to ""create simulations for various burst scenarios to assess what parameters would best mitigate the damage caused by the resulting pressure waves.""ù Meanwhile fourth-year Physics major Jeeya Khetia is ""designing penetrators that could be used in these simulations.""ù† With the work of PI, Lubin hopes to put in place ""the ultimate environmental project""ù and protect Earth from the previously uncontrollable threats from the skies.

science,UCSB Marine Science Institute Highlights Microbes as Key to Further Medical Discovery,23-Nov-21,1:19 PM,"['Audrey Moeller', 'Anaya Khan']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-23/ucsb-marine-science-institute-highlights-microbes-as-key-to-further-medical-discovery/,"Have you ever heard the phrase, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend""ù? In early October, researchers Isabel J. Jones, Susanne H. Sokolow and Giulio A. De Leo from the Marine Science Institute at UC Santa Barbara explored the benefits of using natural enemies as a sustainable method to control human infections, detailing their findings in a paper published in the journal ""People and Nature. Future exploration in the field may allow for the efficient production of vaccines, eradication of certain diseases and discovery of natural enemies that would fight the disease on your behalf. In fact, your health benefits from natural ""enemies""ù all the time. Communities of helpful microbes on your skin, on your mucosa and in your gut suppress the proliferation of harmful bacteria through resource competition and the production of antimicrobial compounds. Resulting from a new wave of clinical trials, some natural, enemy-based therapeutics have been commercialized, such as the use of probiotics for Salmonella, Clostridium and other upper respiratory infections. Bacteriophages have also received attention as a promising alternative to antibiotics for multidrug-resistant infections.† Probiotics have recently been researched as a therapeutic natural enemy solution for salmonella. As pointed out by De Leo, a Stanford biology professor and theoretical ecologist, ""the revolutionary progress of biotechnology has led us to think that there will be a vaccine or a cure for any disease.""ù While this has proven certainly true in the case of COVID-19, other parasitic diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis still lack cost-effective vaccines. Chemotherapy treatment is also limited and could, through repeated usage, lead to selection for drug resistance.† ""Targeting parasites, pathogens and their wildlife hosts when they are in the environment is a complementary strategy that has so far received limited attention,""ù De Leo said. ""Ideally, use of natural enemy solutions should be integrated in the livelihoods of the human population at risk so that it can provide multiple benefits, from the control of infectious diseases of public health or veterinary importance, to improve nutrition and fight against poverty.""ù† In addition to serving as a complement to conventional medicine, natural enemy solutions offer co-benefits for conservation and food security.† Protecting some natural enemies could align goals for conservation and improving human health. In North America and Europe, diverse predator communities such as foxes and wolves are associated with lower tick infections of Lyme disease. Protection of the red fox enhances rodent predation and, as a result, tick infection probability decreases. Restoration of wolves indirectly reduces rodent populations by decreasing the fox and coyote populations and even reproductive hosts for ticks, such as deer.  Another example of a natural enemy solution is observed in how protection of the red fox population subsequently increases the predation of rodents, which reduces the probability of tick infections. Food security, an ever-present issue in today's society, can also benefit from natural enemy solutions, according to the natural enemies article. In Vietnam, snail-eating fish are stocked in aquaculture facilities for biological control against fish-borne zoonotic trematodes (e.g., Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini). The reduction of trematode infections in fish leads to greater fish survival and marketability, thus protecting human health and local economies.† If there is so much potential in the research of natural enemies, why hasn't there been an outburst of research in the field? The lack of investment is clarified by De Leo in his statement that ""natural enemy solutions cannot be easily patented, and this might explain why there has been a lack of interest ""î and associated private research funds ""î in this direction.""ù† Though this may have been the case in the past, there is hope for future endeavors. ""The development of cost-effective techniques to engineer mosquitoes or snails that are immune to infection, such as CRISPR-based gene drives, is certainly gathering more traction from public and privately funded research,""ù De Leo said.† He currently advocates for a collaborative approach to the experiments, seeking a joint effort between multiple agencies and donors. ""I personally advocate [for] a collaborative approach between a range of agencies and donors capable of recognizing the integrated nature of the complex relationship between human health, poverty and environmental control and willing to support a specific ""òleg,' so to speak, of this multi-effort approach,""ù he said.† The possibilities of medicinal discoveries are endless, and there is much to hope for and look forward to. It is only a matter of time until we see natural enemies alongside common medical treatments. ""Looking ahead,""ù as discussed in the research article, ""some natural enemy solutions could complement conventional (chemical drug or insecticide-based) strategies to curb disease transmission by targeting environmental sources of infection.""ù A version of this article appeared on p.13 of the November 18, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Angel Laureano holds a vial of the COVID-19 vaccine, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Md., Dec. 14, 2020. (Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons) On November 2, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was approved for administration in an age-appropriate dosage for children aged 5-11. With this recent milestone, many of us have been wondering what the vaccine development and approval processes entail. Here we'll dive into a brief, general overview of the stages.† The vaccine development cycle includes an exploratory stage, a pre-clinical stage, clinical development, regulatory review and approval, manufacturing, and quality control. Clinical development contains three phases, the first of which consists of small groups receiving a trial vaccine. Next, the clinical study expands and the vaccine is distributed to people sharing characteristics found in the intended vaccine population (e.g. age, physical condition). In Phase III, the vaccine is administered to thousands of people and tested for efficacy. Usually, there is an additional Phase IV consisting of ongoing studies after the vaccine has been approved and licensed.† The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates all vaccine products within the U.S. Vaccine sponsors must follow a comprehensive approval process, which includes an Investigational New Drug application, pre-licensure vaccine trials, a Biologics License Application, inspection of the manufacturing facility, a presentation of findings to the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, and product labeling tests. If a formal approval is granted, the FDA continues to monitor production activities through periodic facility inspections and safety testing in each vaccine lot. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System analyzes information from reports of side effects from U.S.-licensed vaccines.† In an effort to vaccinate populations as soon as possible, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccines were all issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in December 2020. Under an EUA the FDA may allow the distribution of unapproved medical products to prevent, diagnose or treat disease when alternatives are lacking.† Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request, the FDA must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine EUA requests are submitted to the FDA based on Phase III trial analysis or interim analysis ""î analysis before the end of a trial once data has met the predetermined success mark. The EUA submission must include all safety data from Phases I and II, and Phase III data must show that at least half of fully-vaccinated participants receive at least two months of follow-up reporting. Within the Phase III safety database, over 3,000 fully-vaccinated participants must be followed for serious side effects for at least one month.

Indeed, some rockfish are among the longest-lived extant vertebrates on the planet. But why is this the case?† A number of researchers in the Marine Science Institute at UC Santa Barbara, working in collaboration with other scientists from UC Berkeley, Washington, Alabama, British Columbia and Chile, have sought to uncover the evolutionary reason for this. By performing genomic analyses on 88 different species of rockfish, the researchers detected the specific genetic drivers for longevity in these species that promote DNA repair and immunity.† Nakamura Lights The Way Shuji Nakamura, a UCSB professor of materials science and electrical and computer engineering, recently won the third annual Richard J.

In the 1990s, Nakamura developed a system to ensure the high quality of gallium nitride crystals which underpin LED technology, paving the way for their application in everything from traffic signals to fairy lights. The award Nakamura is receiving from ASME is given to those who have ""[pioneered] contributions to the frontiers of energy, leading to breakthroughs in existing technology, leading to new applications or new areas of engineering endeavor, or leading to policy initiatives.""ù This is one of numerous accolades the professor has received in the past decade and a half, including others such as the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics and the 2021 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.† Pyro Predictions Devastating wildfires have rocked the North American continent this year, with mammoth blazes in places as far south as Arizona and as far north as British Columbia.

In addition, they pinpointed how previous burn events can serve as barriers to subsequent fires in some places. With these findings, Park, Moritz and their collaborators hope to provide the public with tools to map out the local probability of fires across the state.

How living organisms extended beyond the constraints of the microscopic realm?† †A rendering of Fractofusus misrai, a soft-bodied sea animal from the Ediacaran period. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The Ediacaran Period, the era directly preceding the Cambrian explosion, ranging from 635 to 539 million years ago, witnessed a massive evolution of macroscopic life. This rapid development in fossil production led to the rise of Darwin's dilemma and the seeming inability of his theory of gradual evolution to address this large shift in biological life. In November 2021, researchers Daniel J. Condon, Xian-Hua Li, Dmitriy V. Grazhdankin, Fred T. Bowyer, Francis A. MacDonald, Chuan Yang, Alan D. Rooney and Maoyan Zhu from UC Santa Barbara's Department of Earth Science shared their efforts in closing the gap of knowledge that surrounds the period with research published in Science.† An interview with MacDonald revealed that prior to the development of macroscopic organisms, the beings existing on Earth were overwhelmingly microscopic and soft-bodied.† ""There's actually quite a rich record there but it's mostly micro and it's mostly soft-bodied, and the micro stuff in the soft-bodied material does not preserve as well [in] the geological record,""ù MacDonald said. For this reason, there was an incomplete model of the fossil records. MacDonald and his colleagues joined together to map an accurate time-calibrated model of the Ediacaran Period through the use of new methods to date and analyze sediment.† In the past, it was difficult to obtain radioisotopic age constraints, given that specific material created from volcanoes was needed in order to accurately retrieve information. Unfortunately, the sediment created from the eruptions was not always present when important changes to evolution occurred. MacDonald stated that many of the most important successions ""î changes in the composition of the sediment ""î ""may have things like fossils on them, they don't happen to have a volcano going in there all the time.""ù† Fortunately, through the research project, MacDonald and Rooney were able to extract accurate dates from the use of a rhenium-osmium chronometer. In the interview, MacDonald explained the processes by which this form of dating functions. ""The rhenium is actually trapped within carrageen and organic matter. And then, if that is trapped, you can actually count the rhenium and count the daughter osnium and actually get a date on a sediment.""ù† Rooney and MacDonald experimented in southern China and were able to accurately extract dates from the sediment. ""We've been kind of calibrating it and a lot of different successions,""ù MacDonald noted, ""and it's been proving to be at least accurate ""¶ What we did here is we found successions.""ù† With the new data, the researchers are a step closer in creating a full model of the Ediacaran Period. ""These changes to the carbon cycle that we're seeing in carbon isotopes ""¶ reassess what the real record is and what the relationships are between perturbations in the carbon cycle and turnovers of these major fossil groups.""ù† This research is only the beginning, according to MacDonald. ""[The project] is coming at the beginning of a large, international drilling project that we're involved with ""¶ we are drilling sedimentary cores in several regions around the world through this interval, going into the Cambrian explosion to try to create ""¶ a modern age model,""ù he said.† While progress has been made, scientists continue their pursuit in mapping out Earth's biological history. The answers to all scientific questions remain unknown, and in MacDonald's words, the uncertainty is alright. ""The beauty of the scientific method is that we can keep exploring these details,""ù he said. ""We don't have it all solved and that's that's okay. We still haven't sorted out Darwin's dilemma ""¶ we are, I think, making progress.""ù

science,Simply Stated: What Is the Best Form of Caffeine?,5-Dec-21,11:40 PM,['Audrey Moeller'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-12-05/simply-stated-what-is-the-best-form-of-caffeine/,"Dedicated to the weird and wonderful science of everyday things and the world around us, Simply Stated features no-nonsense explanations of technology, medicine, natural phenomena and any other assortment of subjects which may spark one's curiosity. If you, our reader, has any questions yourself, feel free to send them our way at science@dailynexus.com.† With the approach of finals, caffeine is the official sponsor of late-night studying. So, what should you be drinking to stay fueled and focused? Luca Disbrow / Daily Nexus In the United States, 85% of adults consume caffeine daily, with an average intake of 135 milligrams per day or 1.5 standard cups of coffee (1 standard cup is 8 fluid ounces or 235 milliliters). Your body is able to absorb up to 99% of the caffeine found in coffee, enabling the compound to reach peak blood concentration levels as soon as 15 minutes after consumption. Once absorbed, caffeine crosses the blood-brain barrier and blocks the inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine, promoting alertness and providing your body with an instant energy boost. Not only can a daily cup of coffee make you feel more energized, but it also burns fat, improves physical performance and lowers the risk of several diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and cancer. Studies suggest that coffee may even boost longevity ""î two large, observational studies reported by Healthline Media revealed that drinking coffee was associated with a reduced risk of death of 20% in men and 26% in women of ages 18-24.† But coffee has a strong competitor: caffeinated tea. We'll look at two popular tea-based coffee alternatives, starting with matcha. Coffee contains about 90-95 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce cup, while matcha contains 38-88 milligrams of caffeine per 2-ounce serving. Although matcha has less caffeine, it lasts much longer in the body. The small amounts of caffeine in this concentrated green tea take longer to enter the bloodstream and can last as long as six hours. As a result, the ""crash""ù that people experience an hour or two after drinking coffee doesn't happen with matcha. The leading explanation for this revolves around the amino acid L-theanine, which acts with other antioxidants, flavonoids and phytonutrients to slow down the body's absorption of caffeine, resulting in a gentle introduction of caffeine into the system and a lengthened period of wakefulness. L-theanine also stimulates the production of serotonin, a feel-good neurotransmitter that can reduce stress and boost your mood by lowering blood pressure, reducing cortisol levels and increasing alpha waves in your brain. Abundant in the phytochemical EGCG, matcha has strong thermogenic properties that increase fat metabolism and help promote weight loss. Unlike coffee, matcha contains antibacterial properties that leave you with a fresh mouth and clean teeth. The yerba mate herbal tea infusion, one of the most popular drinks at UC Santa Barbara, is another tea-based coffee alternative. At 85 milligrams of caffeine per cup, yerba mate contains less caffeine than coffee but more than a cup of tea. Similar to matcha, yerba mate is slower to introduce caffeine into your system but lasts longer and helps you avoid the jitters and crashes from coffee. Referred to as ""the drink of the gods,""ù yerba mate is packed with antioxidants; while coffee and matcha are both also known for being high in antioxidants,† yerba mate beats both with 24 different vitamins and minerals, 15 amino acids with antioxidants and 196 volatile chemicals. Preliminary studies have shown that yerba mate can help stimulate fat oxidation and feelings of fullness, leading to weight loss. Its anti-inflammatory compounds reduce inflammation markers and help to prevent colon cancer, urinary tract infections and kidney stones. Caffeine, no matter the form, should be taken in moderation for the best effect. For a quick boost, coffee is your best option. However, alternatives such as matcha or yerba mate are better for sustained energy throughout the day.

NASA and SpaceX seek to find out with their Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), launched from the SLC-4E launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. By crashing the DART spacecraft into an asteroid at 15,000 miles per hour, and measuring the ensuing change in velocity, the agencies will determine if humanity has the power to change the path of such space debris, or if Earth remains entirely vulnerable to interplanetary threats.† The mission marks the first time SpaceX will make contact with an interplanetary object. Chris Puga / Daily Nexus The refrigerator-sized spacecraft, constructed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, features a DRACO camera, two solar arrays and a NEXT-C ion thruster. DART's sole goal is to navigate interplanetary space, identify its target and speed into it at 6.7 km/s. The $324 million mission is a departure from NASA's usual role of space exploration to that of a planetary defender. Next October, after nearly a year of coasting, DART will intersect with a pair of asteroids in interplanetary space, Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos, which were both first discovered in April 1996 by the Kitt Peak National Observatory.† Dimorphos will serve as the bullseye for DART, with scientists expecting the collision to alter its 12-hour orbit by 10 minutes.

science,Simply Stated: Does it Really Never Rain in Southern California?,19-Dec-21,11:47 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-12-19/simply-stated-does-it-really-never-rain-in-southern-california/,"Dedicated to the weird and wonderful science of everyday things and the world around us, Simply Stated features no-nonsense explanations of technology, medicine, natural phenomena and any other assortment of subjects which may spark one's curiosity. If you, our reader, has any questions yourself, feel free to send them our way at science@dailynexus.com.† For the first time since October, drought-plagued California was doused with heavy rain and snowfall from Dec. 12-15. Even Southern California got to join in the party, with Santa Barbara and the rest of the South Coast averaging 2 inches of rain at the water's edge and upwards of 5 inches in the mountains. San Marcos Pass, traversed by Highway 154, received more than 8 inches of rain from the storm. Nexus File Photo Such a downpour was a welcome contrast from a very dry November, wherein storms often bypassed the Golden State. Why now, though? Last week's storm was a moderate but slow-moving atmospheric river. Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow bands of condensed moisture in the atmosphere that transport water vapor† ""î sometimes a lot of water vapor ""î from one place to another.†† These bands occur globally and are responsible for moving much of the water vapor that flows outside of the tropics, especially on the west coast of the U.S. and in northern Europe. When they come into contact with a landmass, atmospheric rivers will often release their vapor, resulting in rainfall and snowfall at higher elevations.† California owes much of its rain and snow to atmospheric rivers which barrel toward the state throughout the colder months, generally from November to April. In some years, these bands of moisture provide us with up to half of all the precipitation we'll get in a wet season.† These sorts of storms basically always occur during late autumn, winter and spring because of California's mediterranean climate. The summer months in the state are marked by the presence of an incredibly durable ridge of high pressure to the immediate west of California. High pressure systems, also known as anticyclones, are areas in the atmosphere where the pressure is greater than its surrounding regions. These systems cause winds to blow outward from them toward areas with lower pressure.† Persistent high pressure shapes many of the world's subtropical deserts. In California, high pressure during the summer steers storms well clear of the state. During these times, the only sources of moisture that can reach Southern California come from occasional monsoonal storms to the southwest.† But then comes winter, and this ridge generally begins to break down, allowing storms to move on a more southerly track and soak the Golden State with some much-needed rain and snow. However, this isn't always the case. Resilient ridges in the winter can cause periods of drought and heat, and even during wet years, high pressure will return periodically ""î especially in Southern California ""î ushering in welcome periods of sunshine.

science,How The Omicron Variant Impacts Our Path To COVID-19 Endemicity,5-Jan-22,11:53 AM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-05/how-the-omicron-variant-impacts-path-to-covid-19-endemicity/,"The omicron variant is considered the most infectious variant to date, as its many mutations on the spike protein have been found to help it dodge developed immunity, both among those vaccinated and formerly infected. (Courtesy of American Society of Microbiology) In order to mitigate the spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19, UC Santa Barbara announced on Dec. 21 that the first two weeks of the winter quarter will be conducted via remote instruction. As of Dec. 30, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department reported 538 new cases in Santa Barbara County ""î the most number of cases reported by the department since Jan. 16, 2021. Currently, UCSB plans for a staggered return of students back to campus and mandatory testing, all to ensure a resumption of in-person instruction on Jan. 18. However, the recent and significant increase of COVID-19 case numbers and the systemwide UC announcement of two weeks of remote instruction are reminiscent of a similar series of events that ensued in March of 2020. The two weeks allocated at the start of the pandemic extended to almost two years of remote learning for many students. Thus, UCSB's plan for return, which is subject to reassessment, is met with speculation by some, as many rightfully question whether history will repeat itself.† Lockdown and remote learning continued for as long as it did in 2020 and 2021 because the stay-at-home order was the only option to reduce disease transmission. According to the American Journal of Managed Care, in 2020, news outlets focused on how COVID-19 spread across the globe, while 2021 focused on ending the pandemic through vaccine distribution. History is not repeating itself, and†we are not back to square one, also known as March of 2020.† But now, even with nearly 99.77% of students and 95.61% of employees being vaccinated and better knowledge of how to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, our response to significant variant spread remains the same ""î announce a mandate for distance learning. Can such disruptions to the academic continuum be sustainable? On a larger scale, will there be an end to the pandemic, or is COVID-19 here to stay?† According to a survey conducted by Nature, out of over 100 infectious-disease researchers, immunologists, and virologists, nearly 90% of respondents stated that coronavirus will continue to circulate in certain areas of the world, meaning it will become endemic. A virus is considered endemic when it is transmitted at a predictable or usually prevalent rate, therefore considered characteristic of a specific region, such as influenza, or malaria in certain regions of the world.† Back in October 2021, former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted that delta would catalyze the final COVID-19 spike in the U.S. before cases began to plateau. But now, with COVID-19 cases of the omicron variant on significant rise and mask mandates reinstated, predictions of when, or whether, the pandemic will end are blurry.† One of the first conditions for endemicity is that the number of cases of an infectious disease must stabilize over time. The reproductive number is an indication of how contagious and transmissible an infectious disease is. For a virus to be considered endemic, that number must be stable at one, meaning that for every person that is infected, on average, they infect only one other person.† The omicron variant is considered the most infectious variant to date, as its many mutations on the spike protein have been found to help it dodge developed immunity, both among those vaccinated and formerly infected, creating a heightened risk of contracting and then spreading the virus to others. In a Denmark study, researchers found that omicron is 2.7-3.7 times more infectious than the delta variant among those who have been vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. Indeed, according to an NPR article, the rate at which omicron is spreading is comparable to the rate at which the original COVID-19 strain spread at the beginning of the pandemic. The reproductive number of COVID-19 as of March 17, 2020, for perspective, was 4.02, according to a study published by the Population Health Research Institute. But while the omicron variant may be more transmissible, data indicates that vaccination remains to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death. To assess the risk of hospitalization, a report by the UK Health Agency collected data on 528,176 omicron cases and 573,012 delta cases between Nov. 22 and Dec. 26 of 2021. Those who had received two doses of a vaccine had a 65% lower risk of being admitted to a hospital for omicron than those who had not received any form of vaccination, with an 81% lesser risk of hospitalization for those who had received three vaccine doses. However, the agency conceded that the study doesn't address how the variant will impact healthcare capacity, which is another important and nuanced consideration for endemicity, as the fragility of the healthcare system varies from region to region.† The vaccine is currently the best protection against hospitalization and death by COVID-19, and yet vaccine hesitancy is still prevalent among several demographics in the U.S., representing millions of opportunities for the virus to continue to spread. The course of this pandemic is not cyclical, and we are in a better position to mitigate this virus than we were last year and the year before ""î but it isn't over yet. Research by the University of Texas at Austin COVID-19 Modeling Consortium suggests that omicron cases could peak mid-to-late January, with activities and gatherings becoming safer in February.† Eventually, COVID-19 can be labeled as endemic, but until we increase vaccination rates to slow transmission, limit hospitalization and death to ease strain on the healthcare system, we aren't quite there. And until then, measures like remote learning and mask mandates remain the most effective ways of reducing surges of COVID-19 infections.

science,"At North Campus Open Space, Years of Restoration Work Unveil a Transformed Landscape",13-Jan-22,9:00 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-13/at-north-campus-open-space-years-of-restoration-work-unveil-a-transformed-landscape/,"† What was once a waterlogged golf course now welcomes the return of the upper reaches of Devereux Slough. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus As a freshman living in Santa Catalina Residence Hall, I would occasionally run in the open spaces immediately to the west: an interconnected patchwork of wetlands, estuaries, grasslands and eucalyptus groves making up Sperling Preserve on Ellwood Mesa, Coal Oil Point Reserve and ""î adjoining the two parcels ""î the North Campus Open Space.† I hadn't the foggiest idea then that that parcel providing this continuity had, less than a decade before, been a golf course. When I told this to Andy Lanes, the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity & Ecological Restoration (CCBER) education and outreach coordinator, he grew visibly excited.† ""[I've been] talking about shifting baselines with kids and their relationship with nature. How you might be born into this world and this environment that you're living in is what you know, whether it's a little bit polluted or contaminated,""ù Lanes said. ""Now we're doing restoration. Some of these sites might someday be the opposite. There might be somebody that comes by and goes never having known it as a golf course.""ù The name of this golf course was Ocean Meadows Golf Club, and its construction decades ago was marked by the inundation of a network of natural wetlands with 500,000 cubic yards of soil, forever changing them. From 1965 to 2013, the course welcomed golfers who could tolerate its tendency to become muddy and waterlogged. Even prior to the establishment of the golf course, the land north of Devereux Slough was altered to accommodate the ever-changing and multitudinous needs of its human inhabitants.† ""We have some early aerial photos of the areas starting in 1921. We can see what those systems were like. But even by that time, they were largely degraded from all the change from agriculture to other developments in the area,""ù Lanes said. In a landmark conservation deal with the Trust for Public Land in 2013, Ocean Meadows Golf Club was sold by its owner, Mark Green, for $7 million, with a further $10 million raised to facilitate the golf course's transformation into a ""functional and educational wetland,""ù with CCBER's help.†† For the past seven years, CCBER ""î led by Lisa Stratton, the director of ecosystem management ""î has spent those millions of dollars working to bring the historic tidal estuary back to the present.† ""The general idea was, would it be possible to take this golf course and integrate it back into this historic wetland? And so, we've been doing that,""ù Lanes said.† First, they brought in heavy equipment to grade the former golf course and create a landscape of wetlands and uplands. A total of 350,000 cubic yards of soil were excavated to accomplish this. In addition, the network of concrete paths which navigated the golf course was broken up and left in piles throughout the preserve to serve as an innovative habitat for wildlife.† Then came revegetation efforts by CCBER, which has carried out thousands of hours of work to suppress invasive species and promote the reestablishment of native plants.† ""We have new strategies to do larger areas out there like drill seeding the seeds of native grasses to plant much higher numbers of grasses than we otherwise would be,""ù Lanes said.† ""When we can't do that, however, we're planting everything individually. Individual plants in 2-inch pots, hundreds of thousands. It's a huge project, a lot of work, and they're all grown organically and initiated from seed that we collected locally ""î not just focusing on California natives but also specifically local genetics.""ù What has resulted from this work is a landscape transformation. Now, the North Campus Open Space (NCOS), readily accessible from Sierra Madre Villages, encompasses an undulating wetland landscape with tributary drainages that extend north of Devereux Slough and penetrate northwestward and northeastward.† Surrounding these wetlands is a series of trails and bridges, 2.25 miles in total length and connecting to the California Coastal Trail, which provides walkers with ample opportunities to see the slough from a variety of vantage points.†† How water moves on the land has also transformed. What was once a waterlogged golf course now welcomes the return of the upper reaches of Devereux Slough, which itself welcomes wildlife large, like the great blue heron, as well as small, like the elusive and ephemeral tidewater goby, which sneaks into the slough when it connects to the ocean following heavy rainstorms.† ""So the golf course wasn't a bad habitat [for birds]. However, we know that we've lost a lot of wetlands in California, particularly Southern California, and rebuilding a wetland may change the number of birds or change the types of birds that we see in the wetland,""ù Lanes said. ""I've seen a huge change in the wildlife, particularly waterfowl and shorebirds and even the endangered snowy plovers.""ù† The broken-up concrete slabs strewn about the open space are even known to host burrowing owls, according to Lanes.† As the wetlands and mudflats have extended the range of the tidal estuary, the architects of the NCOS have worked to make the landscape more resilient to climate change by incorporating potential complications from sea-level rise into their management plans.† Since then, the project has taken on many new helpers. Anywhere from 10 to 40 undergraduate students per quarter work on the project part time, carrying out ongoing landscaping and restoration work to reestablish native plants in the open space preserve.† What Lanes finds especially rewarding about the restoration process are the educational opportunities that it has provided for students ""î not just undergraduates, but also young children throughout the South Coast and beyond.† ""It's an ideal place. We have this unprecedented wetland restoration project within a mile of [the] UCSB campus but also right next door to elementary schools, to preschools, and then the whole surrounding community over there. So all of these people are using it. There's even an outdoor classroom being constructed currently,""ù Lanes said.† To provide services to those in the community, the open space has also enlisted the help of naturalists in the general public who have become certified to serve as nature guides. These guides provide tours on the third Saturday of every month as well as more specialized tours during other times. A tour on the 15th this week, for instance, will be held in both English and Spanish. For those hoping to contribute to restoration efforts, the second Saturday of every month provides an opportunity to volunteer in the open space. ""The school year before [2020], we had over 1,200 students come to visit to work on the project. So, I think it's hugely successful and not just for the wetland being restored but also the community itself,""ù Lanes said. ""For me, a local, seeing it all happen is crazy. It's so much different. I used to play golf there with my dad when I was a kid ""¶ it's amazing seeing it now as a wetland and being like, ""òOh, this is where the ninth hole was or where I made that shot that one day.' Now I'm working there with kids. It's such a trip.""ù†

However, this development was previously hindered by instabilities and safety concerns. A research team belonging to the UC Santa Barbara Materials Research Laboratory, including graduate students such as Seamus D. Jones, Howie Nguyen and Peter M. Richardson, sought to solve this problem.† They found that solid polymeric electrolytes (SPEs) are a possible solution to this issue, although they were initially found to have limited conductivity. However, this challenge was overcome via ""zwitterionic SPEs,""ù meaning that the electrolytes have a positive and a negative charge, allowing for excellent lithium conductivity.† Detangling Plant Population Dynamics A recent publication by UCSB Earth Research Institute's Tom W. Bell and UCSB geography professor David A. Siegel highlights the difficulty in quantifying plant abundance and health on relevant scales of space and time. According to Bell and Siegel, these estimates are important to quantify, as they can elucidate how environmental change impacts plant population dynamics both in the sea and on land. Specifically, they studied patterns of biomass loss across kelp forests. To dissect what drives ecological population dynamics, Bell and Siegel found it important to first organize the scales in order to observe the system, which is influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic biotic factors. They used remote sensing observations to assess patterns in nutrient concentrations and temperature of seawater, which were found to be inversely correlated with each other. The impact of separating external and internal drivers of the dynamics of plant population and conducting repeat measurements provided them with a better and more complex knowledge of what factors regulate abundance.† Into the Interstellar The cosmos has remained to be an expanse overwhelmingly foreign to us, as the human race has completed only a couple of missions to the moon or to various planets. Despite exciting developments in our astronomic understanding, our interstellar exploration is limited by the brevity of human life, as it takes several decades to travel beyond the heliopause 18 million kilometers beyond, which is the boundary where the sun's solar winds are stopped by the interstellar boundary.† However, a recent NASA study called Project Starlight holds promise in significantly increasing spacecraft speed and rethinking current measures of space propulsion. In an article published this month in Acta Astronautica, UCSB physics professor Philip Lubin and molecular, cellular and developmental biology distinguished professor Joel Rothman consider the potential and consequences of this project as well the ethical implications. The goal of the project, they analyze, is to use direct photon momentum exchange to achieve velocities that would condense what took previous space probes years into mere days. This is made possible by very recent technology, using photon propulsion to achieve extremely high velocities. A dramatic decrease in the time it takes to go beyond the interstellar boundary provides NASA with the unique opportunity to study living microorganisms in the interstellar.†

science,"Simply Stated: Food Fight? ‚""Starving‚""ù the Cancer",27-Jan-22,1:10 PM,['Audrey Moeller'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-27/simply-stated-food-fight-starving-the-cancer/,"A typical adult's body contains 60,000 miles' worth of blood vessels, enough to circle the Earth twice around. The smallest of these blood vessels are called capillaries, of which we each contain around 19 billion. In a way, these are the vessels that carry life, but can also carry death.† The body is able to regulate the number of blood vessels that are present at any given time through an elaborate system of stimulants and inhibitors. This process, known as angiogenesis, controls the formation of new blood vessels. When we need an increase in blood vessels, such as after an injury or during pregnancy, existing blood vessels release stimulators (proteins called angiogenic factors) that prompt the growth of new blood vessels. When these excess blood vessels are no longer needed, the body prunes them back to a baseline amount using the naturally occurring inhibitors in angiogenesis.† However, for a number of diseases, there are evident defects in this system, in which the body either can't prune back extra blood vessels or can't grow enough new ones when they are needed.† As explained by Dr. William Li in his TED Talk ""Can we eat to starve cancer?,""ù this imbalance of angiogenesis results in a variety of severe diseases. Insufficient angiogenesis (not enough blood vessels) leads to conditions such as chronic wounds, coronary heart disease and neuropathy. Excess angiogenesis (too many blood vessels) also drives disease, as seen with cancer, arthritis and obesity. ""In total, there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator,""ù Li said.† Abnormal angiogenesis is present in every cancer, although cancers are completely harmless when they first begin growing. Cancers start out as microscopic nests of cells that only grow to 0.5 cubic millimeters in size (approximately the tip of a ballpoint pen). These nests can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply and are therefore unable to access enough oxygen and nutrients.† According to Li, ""autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40% of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts. About 50% of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers. Virtually all of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.""ù We are probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our bodies, but most of them will never become dangerous. With a normal balance of angiogenesis, your body can prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells, thereby preventing tumors from growing.† The issue occurs when cancer cells mutate and gain the ability to produce lots of angiogenic factors that prompt blood vessels to grow toward the cancer source. Once the tumor has access to oxygen and nutrients from the blood vessel, it can expand and invade local tissues. These blood vessels not only feed tumors but enable cancer cells to enter our circulation and metastasize. Once angiogenesis occurs, cancers grow exponentially and go from being harmless to potentially deadly. This late stage of cancer is the one at which people are most likely to be diagnosed.† Unlike with chemotherapy, recently discovered anti-angiogenic therapy cuts off the blood supply to tumors by targeting the blood vessels that feed cancers. The first pioneered treatments for people as well as dogs are already becoming available. There are 12 different drugs encompassing 11 different cancer types, such as Avastin which treats colon, lung, breast, brain and kidney cancer, as well as Palladia which treats mast cell tumors in canines.† ""Starting in 2004, when anti-angiogenic therapies first became available, there has been a 70-100% increase improvement in survival of cancer patients with metastatic kidney cancer, multiple myeloma cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors compared to when chemotherapy and radiation were the only available treatments,""ù Li said. But rather than treating cancer when tumors have already metastasized, he is focusing on helping individuals avoid cancer altogether through the prevention of angiogenesis.† With the discovery that diet accounts for 30-50% of environmentally caused cancers, Li used a testing system of food extracts and blood vessels to create a list of naturally anti-angiogenic foods that boost the body's defense system and beat back cancer-feeding blood vessels. Included in this list are green tea, berries, citrus, red grapes, red wine, bok choy, kale, soy beans, ginseng, maitake mushrooms, licorice, turmeric, nutmeg, artichokes, lavender, pumpkin, sea cucumber, tuna, parsley, garlic, olive oil, grape seed oil, dark chocolate and many more common foods. Lorelei Mucci, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, stated that, based on a Harvard study of 79,000 men, ""men who consume 2-3 servings of cooked tomatoes per week have a reduced risk for developing prostate cancer by 40-50%.""ù Among the 8,200 men who did develop prostate cancer, those who ate more servings of tomato sauce had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer. This study is just one example of how anti-angiogenic substances consumed at practical levels can have a huge impact on cancer development.† As stated by Li, ""for many people in the world, dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive in-stage cancer treatments. But everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local, sustainable anti-angiogenic crops.""ù Comments are closed.

However, for smaller creatures, like arthropods, the nature of these interactions is not well understood. With these being among the most biodiverse and widespread species on Earth, researchers are very interested in finding ways to get past the existing obstacles standing in the way of directly observing these interactions.† Researchers at UC Santa Barbara, working alongside collaborators at the University of Hong Kong, Colorado State University, Stanford University and the University of Georgia, have sought to understand how the traits of these particular predators shape their interactions with other animals. In doing so, they found that the size of prey often scales with the size of predators, and that predator identity, the species of the predator in question, was more relevant in looking at the outcomes of interactions than hunting methods ""ì like using venom or webs, for instance.† Who Brakes for Whales?† Whales are imperiled by a number of things. However, among the most lamentable and preventable causes of whale fatalities are vessel strikes, which threaten large whales like the endangered blue, humpback and fin whales. In order to combat a rash of whale fatalities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has recently put in place voluntary vessel speed reduction zones off of the California coast in order to encourage the largest vessels to slow down and lower the likelihood of collisions with endangered whales.† Jono Wilson, a researcher with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, working in collaboration with other researchers at the Greater Farallones Association, NOAA and The Nature Conservancy, recently sought to quantify just how effective these zones are at decreasing vessel speeds. They found that this policy led to decreased speeds but not to the degree that the whales need in order to maintain populations. In addition, in comparison with other incentive-based policies, the voluntary speed reduction zone is woefully inadequate. The researchers suggest that instating regulations might be the best bet to protect these whales.† Hot and Cold Volcanic hotspots, like the kind which create volcanic island chains, such as Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands, are thought to come from plumes deep in the mantle which ascend to the surface ""î in a process known as upwelling ""î because they are much warmer than the surrounding mantle. However, it can be difficult to validate whether or not this is actually the case. Matthew Jackson, a researcher in UCSB's department of Earth Science, working with collaborators at UC Los Angeles and UC Berkeley, tried to make inferences about the temperature of these supposed hot spots by converting seismic velocity ""î the speed at which a wave travels through a medium ""î to temperature. To their surprise, they found that a large proportion of these ""hotspots""ù are actually not hot enough to upwell. The researchers speculate that, instead, these ""cold""ù hotspots are born in the upper mantle or ""entrained and cooled by small-scale convection.""ù

science,"In Race Against New Wave, UCSB Researcher Develops Assay to ID Omicron",27-Jan-22,1:18 PM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-27/103662/,"This coming Monday, Jan. 31, marks the resumption of in-person instruction at UC Santa Barbara after nearly a month of remote learning for the beginning of winter quarter. The two weeks of remote instruction were intended to mitigate a spike in COVID-19 cases that campus medical experts predicted was imminent upon students' return from winter break. Indeed, cases in Santa Barbara County peaked at 1,493 on Jan. 13. From Jan. 18-31, it has been up to instructors to decide whether remote or in-person instruction is more adequate for their respective courses. The prevalence of the omicron variant especially ""î which accounted for 37% of positive results in Santa Barbara in January ""î has fostered collaboration between the UCSB COVID-19 Response Team, local health care providers, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD) and UCSB's own graduate students, with the goal of facilitating students' return to campus.† One of the most important collaborations was an assay that could detect whether a positive COVID-19 test result was of the omicron variant or not, developed by graduate student researcher Zach Aralis ""î†from the biomolecular science and engineering program in the molecular, cellular, and developmental biology department ""î who was overseen by MCDB-affiliated researcher Carolina Arias. Aralis had been working on SARS-CoV-2 research since the beginning of the pandemic, specifically working with the team that helped develop an assay for the general detection of COVID-19 and applied it for early outbreak detection in Santa Barbara. Then, he helped establish the COVID-19 clinical testing laboratory on UCSB's campus ""î which he still manages and runs samples for to this day. In addition, he established Santa Barbara's protocol that is used to help provide sequencing results for monitoring local COVID-19 variants.† The omicron variant of COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than other previously prevalent variants (such as the delta variant), leading to a heightened necessity to distinguish the variant. Arias and Dr. Lynn Fitzgibbons, an infectious disease specialist at Cottage Health, contacted Aralis to see how quickly he could put together an assay to do just that.† One of the most important collaborations was an assay that could detect whether a positive COVID-19†test result was of the Omicron variant. Courtesy of Pennsylvania Department of Health. ""[Because the campus was closed,] the main issue was acquiring the reagents needed for testing of the assay,""ù Aralis said. ""I had to have the custom primers I designed delivered to my apartment. For everything else, I just had to make do with what was lying around in the lab.""ù† Aralis said that this limited his options and dictated some aspects of the assay designs. Still, just a few days before Christmas, Aralis got to work.† ""The design was fairly simple in theory,""ù Aralis said. ""I chose to develop a qPCR assay that would target a region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that was heavily mutated in only the omicron variant.""ù† After he found a suitable region, Aralis' next step was to design two sets of primers that would bind to and amplify that region only when RNA from omicron was or wasn't present in a sample.† ""Once I had these primers, the only thing left to do was optimize the reaction conditions to maximize our specificity and sensitivity,""ù Aralis said.† After a day or two of refining and optimizing, Aralis said that he had his first set of results.† ""While many of us suspected that the dramatic increase in positives in Santa Barbara were due to omicron, we really didn't know for certain,""ù Aralis said. ""Unsurprisingly, most of the samples provided by County Public Health and Pacific Diagnostic Laboratories were omicron.""ù† The development of this assay has helped inform physicians in the county on the approximate prevalence of the omicron variant in Santa Barbara. Distinguishing between variants of COVID-19 could be key to preventing the overrun of health care workers as cases ""ì and unavoidably hospitalization rates ""î rise.† ""From a clinical perspective, it's important to note that this assay is a research tool and should not be used to directly impact patient treatment,""ù Aralis said.

Unfortunately, as seen in even the likes of Santa Barbara County, tests remain an object of scarcity. Researchers with UC Santa Barbara, collaborating with researchers at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, have worked together to investigate the possibility of using smartphones to provide an ""inexpensive, rapid, sensitive, and reliable platform""ù for influenza and COVID-19 testing.† Using a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based methodology, which doesn't require highly skilled personnel or expensive instrumentation to administer, the researchers conducted a cohort study with 20 symptomatic patients and 30 asymptomatic patients. They found that the smartphone-based LAMP tests worked as well as traditional PCR tests and believe that it may be useful in places with limited resources.† Which Wood and Why?† Many tropical islands throughout the world have had their native vegetation snuffed out and largely replaced with human-introduced species. One well-known example of this phenomenon is Palmyra Atoll, an island of the Northern Line Islands in the Southern Pacific Ocean which is dominated by coconut palm, a relatively new arrival from the islands between Southeast Asia and Melanesia.† A matter of particular interest to low-lying islands now, with accelerating climate change, is whether or not native species are more equipped to sequester carbon than introduced species are. Researchers at UCSB, working alongside The Nature Conservancy, the University of Idaho and the U.S. Geological Survey, sought to answer this question with ""field sampling, remote sensing, and parameter estimates from the literature.""ù With this data, they found that transitioning to forests dominated by a mixture of native trees would indeed increase the carbon storage potential of Palmyra Atoll, while also serving to protect the island against coral disease. The Building Blocks of a Brain The human brain has 85 billion neurons. Researchers have long sought to map out the many coordinated interactions and workings of this network of cells. However, such aspirations face many logistical hurdles. Because of this, there has been much interest in modeling the neural circuitry of simpler chordates. With this in mind, William Smith, a professor at UCSB, working with collaborators at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, has labored tirelessly for years to create a wiring diagram of the Ciona, a primitive chordate with only 177 neurons.† The fruits of Smith's labor lay in an interaction matrix which details the 6,618 synaptic connections between the Ciona's neurons, made possible by compiling electron microscopy images. In addition to mapping out this neural circuitry, Smith has begun work with UCSB Electrical and Computer Engineering professor B. S. Manjunath and collaborator Angela Zhang. They work with the aim of figuring out which of six neurotransmitters exist in the neurons using deep-learning models.

Through cellular respiration, plants break down sugar to use as energy while releasing carbon dioxide as a byproduct, in addition to water.† The researchers were able to see how carbon balance†may influence the distribution of plants. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus Climate and the availability of water have a big impact on foundational processes like photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Conditions which are too hot or dry, for instance ""î prompting drought stress in plants ""î can inhibit photosynthesis.† Assistant professor Anna Trugman and postdoctoral scholar Justin Mathias, two researchers in the UC Santa Barbara Department of Geography, have conducted much research with the aim of better understanding how forests ""î and particularly the carbon use efficiency of forests ""î will respond to the warming and drying conditions seen in the West.† But first, what is carbon use efficiency?† ""What that really means is net primary productivity. So gross primary productivity is the carbon that is fixed during photosynthesis. Net primary productivity is then ultimately that carbon minus the carbon taken up by respiratory costs,""ù Trugman said.† The term used to quantify the carbon use efficiency of plants is carbon balance, according to Trugman. ""So just like you and I, where we respire and make carbon dioxide, plants do the same thing to maintain their general function. So that's what primary productivity is. And so carbon balance is the balance to grow after the cost that they have to cover for general functioning,""ù Trugman said. Thus, a positive carbon balance is one wherein there is a net gain of carbon fixed during the combined processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration, allowing for growth. Anything below that will negatively impact plants. A plant locked in a negative carbon balance for an extended period of time will become more susceptible to disease and other stressors. Eventually, it will die.† As the weather whiplash of the Western states intensifies under climate change, concerns over the health of Western forests ""î which provide innumerable benefits to human beings ""î have continued to grow. Research into how forests will respond to warming has become more and more prominent.† Trugman and Mathias' new research lies firmly in this niche.† ""We wanted to understand the uncertainty associated with this respiration sensitivity to temperature and how it affected our understanding of plant carbon balance and tree distribution,""ù Trugman said.† In order to accomplish this, the researchers used a plant physiological model and ran it under future climate scenarios. However, they needed to validate this.† In order to test whether or not their model looking at carbon use efficiency was compatible with existing conditions, the researchers made use of data from different research groups. This high-resolution data looked at existing carbon use efficiency data. In addition to this, the researchers looked at vegetation canopy height data measured using LIDAR, an ""airborne remote sensing system.""ù† What they found was exciting from a research standpoint, according to Trugman. Their model that they used to look at future carbon use efficiency was also compatible with the existing geographic range limits of forests in the West. By looking at the spatial distribution of existing transition zones between forest canopies and more sparse or low-lying plant communities like shubland, the researchers were able to see how the carbon balance of those particular areas may influence the distribution of plants.† ""These range edge components really emerged as a very interesting component of the model that was quite unexpected, while we were trying to validate our model,""ù Trugman said.† ""We used the model to see what the carbon balance of those particular [areas] would be given our knowledge of the climate, and we saw particularly at dry range edges, this really sharp transition from a reasonable carbon use efficiency to one that went to zero and then potentially negative, indicating that you really couldn't get a tree to exist in those locations,""ù Trugman said. With this, the researchers found that ""î if the models are correct ""î while the carbon use efficiency of core forest areas will increase, the area of forest cover along dry range edges will actually decrease markedly.† ""I guess the message would be there's actually a pretty nuanced response, potentially, to how we might see more ecosystems affected by climate change,""ù Trugman said.

science,UCSB‚'s Young Lab Pioneers New Method of Inducing Superconducting State,9-Feb-22,2:30 PM,"[""Seamus O'Hara""]",https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-09/ucsbs-young-lab-pioneers-new-method-of-inducing-superconducting-state/,"Physicists tend to attach simple names to extraordinary phenomena. Materials that allow electrons to conduct with no resistance, no dissipation, are called ""superconductors.""ù The dissipationless movement of electrons has a radical implication; once the electrons start traveling, they will never stop until the superconducting state is broken. That's how ""super""ù these conductors are. The superconducting state was brought about in an unusual way, with researchers applying a magnetic field along the direction of the carbon sheets. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons UC Santa Barbara physicists have recently been able to observe the superconducting state of Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG), a material that is literally two, atomically thin sheets of carbon atoms. Their results were reported in a paper recently published in Science. The superconducting state was brought about in an unusual way, with researchers applying a magnetic field along the direction of the carbon sheets. In most materials, this would disturb the superconducting state. The Young lab argues the magnetic field breaks the symmetry of the graphene, taking the electrons to a new regime where they can move with no resistance.† This work goes beyond the superconductivity of BBG and details extensive measurements done by the group to understand how the electrons are behaving under a wide variety of experimental conditions. The researchers saw how the resistance of their device changed with increasing the out-of-plane magnetic field. ""We implemented this (widely used) technique ""¶ and found that mapping out how the ""¶ frequencies continuously changes with charge carrier density is very helpful in understanding the electronic properties,""ù Dr. Haoxin Zhou said, who is a postdoctoral researcher at Caltech and the first author of the work. These changes correspond to what quantum states the electrons are occupying, all leading to an understanding of what symmetries the BBG is preserving.† Earlier works have shown graphene to superconduct under the right experimental conditions. This paper stands apart from the other experiments because the Young lab was able to get the ground state of the graphene system to demonstrate superconductivity. A ground state is the lowest energy state of a system, and thus, most favorable for the system to arrange itself. A ball sitting at the bottom of a bowl is in its ground state. If you push the ball away, the ball will return to the bottom of the bowl. For the UCSB researchers, having a superconducting ground state allowed them to subject the sample to a battery of experimental conditions without destroying the sample. ""It's pretty exciting to have something much more flexible. To not just show that it superconducts, but to understand why,""ù Caitlin Patterson, a UCSB physics doctoral student and co-author on the report, said.† Other reports of superconducting graphene have changed the focus of research groups. In 2018, twisted graphene was the first graphene system reported to superconduct, and was presented for the first time at the American Physical Society March Meeting; the 2022 March Meeting has three sessions devoted to twisted graphene.† The UCSB researchers are optimistic that others will try to replicate their superconducting result, and maybe use this newly discovered behavior in a future graphene device. Other groups have already posted replications of the UCSB superconducting result on the preprint library arXiv. In addition, the Young lab hopes BBG will serve as a stable platform to investigate all the novel phenomena it hosts. ""[T]he main difference is that BBG is simple and stable. It is the second simplest graphene system that stably exists in the world""¶ [I]t can be used as a platform to expand the knowledge of the general theory of superconductivity,""ù Zhou said. Because of BBG's reliability and availability, the UCSB researchers believe that groups around the world will soon start incorporating the material into complex quantum circuitry. †""[BBG] is actually very reproducible. You can actually think about making applications without wondering if it superconducts or not,""ù Ludwig Holleis, a UCSB physics doctoral student and the second author on the paper, said. When asked to reflect on the impact of their recent publication, the Young lab had much to say. ""Graphene is still the wonder material ""¶ With bare graphene, you have superconductivity and magnetism ""¶ all the Dirac physics, all the quantum Hall physics in one material,""ù Holleis said. With respect to potential future research questions, Patterson said, ""Getting to see if we can tell if those individual [differences between other types of graphene superconducting systems] ""¶ contribute to the superconducting will say a lot about how similar graphene superconductivity is in these devices.""ù† To elegantly sum, ""[t]he simplest materials are far more rich than you think,""ù Zhou reflected.

science,Peering Into the Sea Otter Genome Reveals Much,14-Feb-22,8:57 AM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-14/peering-into-the-sea-otter-genome-reveals-much/,"The 18th and 19th centuries were a time of remarkable and unprecedented exploitation across the world ocean. The explosion of practices like whaling and the fur trade led to a wide-ranging collapse of populations of species in a manner which, before and following, has found few parallels. By the early 20th century, the world population of otters numbered in the low thousands ""î from a peakof potentially 300,000. Courtesy of Pixabay Among the most well-known and charismatic casualties was the sea otter, a mammal living in the northern and eastern bounds of the North Pacific which found itself ensnared by the Russian and North American fur trade. Sea otters at that time were prized for their remarkable fur. Lacking blubber, like other marine mammals, sea otters make up for this by having the densest fur of any mammal, period. For every square inch on their body, they have about a million hairs ""î 1,000 times the density of human beings. In addition, under the microscope, this dense fur has a unique geometric, spiky texture which allows it to mat together and create an insulating layer of air close to the skin. These traits make otter fur a fantastic heating system ""î and in the past, an attractive target for the burgeoning fur trade. By the early 20th century, the world population of otters numbered in the low thousands ""î from a peak of potentially 300,000. Protection efforts following this nadir allowed otters to partly rebound throughout their range ""î somewhat of a marine conservation success story. However, they still remain endangered to this day. ""Otter hunting at the height of the fur trade in the 18th and 19th centuries was persistent and intense, and otter populations were decimated throughout their range in the Pacific,""ù said Douglas Kennett, a professor of anthropology at UC Santa Barbara. ""However, our data indicate that remnant populations occurred in each region ""î maybe a few 100 individuals ""î and these animals were the source of the rebound after protection of otters in the early 1900s.""ù A researcher and geneticist with the University of Washington, Annabel Beichman, working in collaboration with researchers from a number of other universities throughout the world, including Kennett, found an opportunity to learn about the genetic consequences of species-wide declines by examining this precipitous and nearly simultaneous drop in global sea otter populations. Kennett, who has worked as an archeologist in the Santa Barbara Channel region since the 1990s, aided Beichman with his knowledge of Chumash hunting practices derived from oral narratives and other historical sources. ""My work on the Channel Islands has shown that otters were persistently hunted starting at least 5,000 years ago. I joined forces with geneticist Annabel Beichman, the lead author on the study, to study the long-term history of the species in the region using contemporary and ancient samples,""ù Kennett said. ""I want to highlight the importance of interdisciplinary and long-term historical research in addressing species extinctions. These efforts are vital for contemporary conservation efforts in the region. Also, I would like to highlight the importance of the archaeological record for establishing long-term baselines for assessing regional extirpation and extinction of species.""ù Beichman, Kennett and their other collaborators worked to carry out genomic analyses of sea otter populations throughout history, detecting historical signals of extreme population decline in all of the populations that they sampled. They drew these samples from 107 sea otters drawn from five distinct populations ""î in addition to three historical samples from California, dating between about 1,500 to 200 years ago. For example, archeological bones from San Miguel Island off the coast of Southern California were used to determine whether or not there was historical continuity between the modern populations of otters in the Southern California region and the Channel Islands of millennia ago. They found that, indeed, California sea otters are part of a population that diverged from a larger ancestral population about 20,000 years ago, according to Kennett. The broader story of otters that was enlightened by the researchers' data told one of a robust population rebound; According to Kennett, the study's data shows that remnant populations of otters persisted and, with protection, were able to once again roam their ancestral habitats in healthier numbers ""î in contrast to another hypothesis which posited that otters from the north Pacific migrated southward into places like Southern California following the fur trade. The researchers found that further population decline could affect the fitness of recovering populations. However, a silver lining also peered through ""î the fact that low but healthy otter populations existed prior to even the fur trade suggests that the otters do not require high population counts to maintain sufficient genetic health. Despite this, Kennett called for more research and data before drawing that conclusion with any larger degree of confidence. ""One of the more interesting results for me was that there was genetic stability between the ancient and modern otter samples in Southern California. These data also suggest that the successful rebound of populations since the early 1900s may be the result of long-standing stability of small populations historically,""ù Kennett said. ""However, we only analyzed a small number of samples and more work is needed to determine how stable otter populations were during the last 10,000 years in the context of Chumash hunting/management practices.""ù Comments are closed.

Dedicated to the weird and wonderful science of everyday things and the world around us, Simply Stated features no-nonsense explanations of technology, medicine, natural phenomena and any other assortment of subjects which may spark one's curiosity. If you, our reader, has any questions yourself, feel free to send them our way at science@dailynexus.com.† The need to mate, love and ""î to a certain extent ""î complicate things are all parts of the human condition. These needs have been summated to a fixation on sex and romance in storybooks, song lyrics, TV shows and movies. Even in academia, extensive research has been conducted on the neurochemical basis of love, psychosexual development (though it pains me to classify Freud as an academic) and genetic connections to sexuality. Daniela Gomez / Daily Nexus To avoid confusion, we must separately define the terms ""sex""ù and ""sexual reproduction,""ù though both comprise of what it takes to prolong our species. ""Sex""ù is intercourse, often a way to express affection or attraction ""î though in this modern age, sometimes it's just intercourse. Now, ""sexual reproduction""ù is the combination of genetic information given by two members of the opposite sex, belonging to one species. In the case of humans, members of the male sex produce sperm that is to be met by the egg, which is created by the female sex. But, to even get to the point of this meeting between the two gametes, quite the journey is required. There is courting to be conducted, texting etiquette to be had, the laws of attraction to be applied. There is the consideration of whether or not either party wants that meeting to happen at all. For as long as humans have been having sex, we have formed and built upon a piece of knowledge and a set of rituals around the concept, one that has caused the act of sex to become more and more abstract, and less about the act itself. And that's only how complicated sex has become. Sexual reproduction requires even more things to go right in order to be successful. To compare, asexual reproduction, the process by which cells divide mitotically, is a more time-efficient way by which many lower organisms produce offspring. While a human can take several months to produce just one offspring, many forms of bacteria can reproduce by the hundreds in a mere couple of hours. No Tinder profile, Caesarean section or other venereal mires required. Through meiosis, the process that underlies sexual reproduction, the gametes must form in their respective bodies, then the member of the male sex must transfer their gamete into the female body. These gametes must fuse, and for a time period that is usually nine months, a human baby is, hopefully, formed from that single fusion of two gametes. It is a beautiful thing, surely, but with so much that could go wrong, one wonders: what benefits does this form of reproduction confer? Enter the microevolutionary Red Queen hypothesis, proposed by UC Berkeley biologist Graham Bell. This model suggests that sex has evolved to give us a fighting chance against parasites. Hostile parasites evolve quite rapidly, and so human evolution's response to this is the production of offspring that, generation by generation, possesses more and more favorable genes that can outcompete or outsmart parasites. Unlike asexual reproduction, which creates exact copies of the parent organism with only the occasional mutation, sexual reproduction creates organisms with a completely unique set of genes that parasites, which have lived hundreds of lifetimes and evolved significantly since the point you were even born, haven't been selected to invade before. If we are only to give half of our genes to our offspring, the other half must be just as good, if not better than our own. Attraction exists for this reason ""î†we are biologically predisposed to value specific traits in an individual, such as strength, energy and good health, that indicate the possession of good, successful genes. Pleasure also exists for this reason ""î if sex was not pleasurable, what motive would there be to pass on genes? Where can there be human progress if there is no self-gratification? Sexual attraction and attachment are often seen as intertwined, but according to UC Santa Barbara anthropology professor Steven Gaulin, they've evolved for separate reasons. Attachment between two partners is the evolutionary result of the need for parental care for human infants, for whom a significant amount of development occurs outside the womb, necessitating further care that is more manageably divided among two people. On a biochemical level, our genes have evolved to produce neuropeptides that contribute to pair-bonding behavior such as monogamy. I know, I know, leave it to a writer from the Science & Tech section to deromanticize romance as much as possible. But, although I am a scientist, I assure you that I am also a romantic. And I've never doubted that the forces of nature do leave room for the soul. E.O. Wilson, an American biologist, wrote in his novel, ""Sociobiology: The New Synthesis,""ù that ""[i]n a sense, human genes have surrendered their primacy in human evolution to an entirely new non-biological or super-organic agent, culture.""ù At the end of the day, we are bipedal organ baskets, yes, but the sheer size and advancement of our brains have allowed us the ability of self-awareness, the ability to define and the ability to redefine. Evolution is the study of how our environment has produced the diversity of life, including us, up to this point. As incidental as the existence of our consciousnesses may seem, I find it glorious that our species has evolved and our genes have amalgamated into a form that can allow the individual to find our own reasons for why we love and why we exist, though to love and exist may be the same thing.

Last November, he joined Feinstein and Padilla, as well as the Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to officially announce that the NMS would be moving into the designation phase.† The Nexus spoke to the NOAA's Regional Policy Coordinator Paul Michel, who outlined the typical process of designating a new marine sanctuary and the next steps NOAA will take in getting the CHNMS designated. Michel said that the designation of new sanctuaries is a process that begins with asking the public for their thoughts on specific aspects of the nomination, such as proposed sanctuary name, boundaries and possible issues to address. This phase, known as the ""scoping phase,""ù is the first step towards official designation.† It is projected to take about 9 to 10 months for the NOAA to review the comments and draft a management plan, proposed regulations and an environmental impact review. The first round of public commentary closed last month, but there will be a second round of public commentary in about a year. From start to finish, this process will take about two and a half years, which, while on track and going smoothly so far, Michel acknowledges is a somewhat ambitious timeline. Because the window for public commentary only just closed, Michel said it is too soon to draw any final conclusions, but he does say that, after having read about 400 responses, there does seem to be a lot of support.† One group which very much supports the designation is the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, located here in the Santa Barbara area. Tribal Chairman Kenneth Kahn said that ""We are proud to support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. As stewards of the environment with strong cultural connections to natural resources, we look forward to working with the NOAA to help manage and protect the sacred sites throughout our beautiful coastline.""ù Regarding what would actually be protected, Michel said that this is actually still being determined, but that there are special natural resources, shipwrecks and cultural and Indigenous heritage resources within the planned boundaries of the NMS. He also said that this sanctuary is important because it will involve Indigenous communities in its management. Carbajal said that some of the things that the sanctuary would protect are feeding grounds for numerous species of whales and dolphins, sea otter populations and kelp forests ""î which are all home to vital commercial and recreational fisheries ""î and that these resources are essential to California's coastal economy. †""I am thrilled the Biden administration has taken this step to protect our coastal areas from further oil and gas drilling and strengthen our state's $1.9 trillion coastal economy, which is propped up by tourism and commercial fishing,""ù Carbajal said about the November 2021 announcement. ""Bringing the proposed sanctuary into the designation phase is the result of years of public engagement and I am grateful that we are one step closer to permanently protecting our coastline for future generations to inherit and enjoy.""ù† He also expressed his gratitude for ""the steadfast leadership of the late Fred Collins, Chairman of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, whose legacy of advocacy was instrumental in moving this project forward.""ù When asked about why the designation of this sanctuary is important for his constituents, Carbajal responded that ""In addition to protecting our coastal economy, the designation would also help us in our fight against climate change and preserve our environment for generations to inherit. Designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will advance President Biden's America the Beautiful campaign to conserve and restore at least 30% of our nation's lands and waters by 2030.""ù He also mentioned that the coastlines protected in this sanctuary would be protected from oil drilling, ""where the ecological and economic devastation from oil spills is all too familiar.""ù A map of the proposed sanctuary. Courtesy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Michel noted that the proposed area for the sanctuary has many challenging issues, including existing drilling platforms, platforms scheduled for removal, wind energy development and Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant decommissioning, just to name a few. However, by both protecting the marine ecosystem in this area and making sure that the proposed site does not overlap with the area designated for offshore wind development (Morro Bay 399 Area), the designation of this sanctuary is expected to further contribute to the Biden-Harris Administration's promise to simultaneously advance marine conservation goals and those of clean energy.† This month, Carbajal, joined by Feinstein and Padilla, as well as several members of the U.S. House's California delegation, sent a letter to the Department of Commerce and NOAA to reemphasize their support for the proposed NMS. ""I will continue working with NOAA and stakeholders throughout this entire process,""ù said Carbajal.

science,When the Data Lies: The Consequences of Racial Bias In Research and Algorithms,22-Feb-22,4:39 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-22/when-the-data-lies-the-consequences-of-racial-bias-in-research-and-algorithms/,"In science within academia, which has historically been dominated by white men, the issue of bias has long posed an obstacle to objectivity in fields intending to engage with and answer questions about human beings, such as anthropology, medicine and psychological sciences. Daniela Gomez / Daily Nexus Even the most innocent and well-intentioned of people fall prey to their own unconscious bias. The nature of human sociality makes it incredibly tempting to place greater stock in those similar to you ""î† often much to the detriment or neglect of others.† Take in-group and out-group bias: Young children themselves have been seen withholding help from those who victimize people in their in-group, while assisting with little hesitation those who wreak havoc on people outside of this in-group. More broadly, the observed tendency toddlers have to preferentially help those in one's in-group when resources are scarce serves as another embodiment of bias. One broader and structural example of bias in academia is seen in the oversampling of American college students ""î† who tend to be white ""î† in psychological studies. This was brought to light and acknowledged as an issue in 2010, more than a decade ago. Then, anthropologist Joe Henrich and psychologists Steven Heine and Ara Norenzayan, researchers with the University of British Columbia, found that undergraduate students from Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (W.E.I.R.D.) societies comprised as much as 80% of participants in studies while making up only 12% of the world population. But there are more concerns with the fallibility of data collection methods than just within the realm of academics. When data itself is skewed, how do the findings themselves ""î or even policies and outcomes ""î get affected by such things?† In the era of big data, when such information is increasingly of consequence to our daily lives, these questions reign supreme. As data and artificial intelligence is used more and more to delegate decision-making to algorithms and make judgment calls once taken upon by human beings ""î† who we'd be remiss not to acknowledge came with their own prejudices and bias ""î concerns over how this disproportionately affects minorities, and particularly Black people, are raised with more and more frequency.† Researchers have shown, for instance, that algorithms †intended to correct for human bias in dispensing things like loans and mortgages in the U.S. credit market still did very little to close the gap in default rates between white people and Black and Hispanic borrowers.† The fields of medicine and criminology are also often problematic in this regard.† Data linkage in healthcare, for instance, has been found to decrease quality of care among minorities in general. Linkage, the process in which data from providers is kept for use in monitoring, planning, research, policy development and other evaluations, is more likely to contain incorrect data or even lack important data among ethnic minorities. This can be due to things like different naming conventions, a not-unfounded lack of trust in health systems and how data is used and a tendency for minorities to frequent health facilities with relatively poor data quality.†† Among Black Americans specifically, an algorithm managing care for 200 million in the U.S. annually has recently come under scrutiny for its tendency to systematically discriminate. According to a study led by a researcher with the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, ""at a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than white patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses.""ù† In other words, in a scenario wherein Black people and white people were equally sick, the algorithm was significantly less likely to refer Black people to programs intended to improve their care. Such a disparity is especially egregious since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, wherein Black Americans were 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID and 1.7 times more likely to die from it.† Similarly, the already incredibly controversial practice of predictive policing has come under fire from many for simply perpetuating racist policing practice. This is by virtue of the fact that ""in numerous jurisdictions, these systems are built on data produced during documented periods of flawed, racially biased, and sometimes unlawful practices and policies,""ù according to researchers with New York University and Northeastern University. On campus, many researchers have sought to level this uneven playing field and have taken steps to correct these inequities and issues inherent in data, for instance, by attempting to bring in more Black students to fields like data science and other disciplines in S.T.E.M. Initiatives championed by CBSR, the Center for Black Studies Research at UC Santa Barbara, like Student Engagement and Enrichment in Data Science, or S.E.E.D.S., aim to establish a ""new and student-driven foundation through a data science living and learning community for understanding issues of personal significance through a diverse lens.""ù† Meanwhile, cross-cultural research has exploded in large part to address the issues which have arisen from Western academia's preoccupation with W.E.I.R.D. students. Those in the anthropological sciences have sought to collaborate with others from across the world hoping to gain insight in how circumstance and other contextual characteristics impact human beings and their behavior, whether one is comparing socioeconomic status, geographic location or any number of qualities which impact why people do what they do and act as they do.

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,25-Feb-22,9:50 AM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-25/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-7/,"Luca Disbrow / Daily Nexus Drosophila Diapause Model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster ""î also known as the common fruit fly ""î provide important insights into the human body, answering questions that arise both when examining the body of a human and that of a fly. One of these questions is why and under what conditions does aging reduce female fertility. Scientists know that D. melanogaster enters a phase called adult reproductive diapause, which is a state in which reproduction is suspended in response to a stressful environment. It is known what genetic and external changes impact reproductive diapause, but what is not known is what precisely facilitates diapause and subsequent recovery after this process. This was precisely the focus of postdoctoral scholars belonging to the Denise Montell Lab of the molecular, cellular, and developmental biology department. The researchers documented the stages of ovarian development during and after diapause and found that an effect on even earlier stages of that development were impacted by diapause, which was not formerly known. Although other stressors to the fly, such as predator exposure or excessive heat, affect these stages, diapause had a profound effect on those stages, specifically in egg chamber development. The factors that impact fertility preservation can lead to further research on maintaining and prolonging longevity, mainly in terms of the fertile stage of organisms, small and large. Contrived Confirmation What we define as truth may be more externally and subjectively influenced than we think. A research team ""ì including professor Jonathan Schooler and postdoctoral researcher John Protzko, who both belong to the psychological & brain sciences department ""î studied what they defined as the ""insight misattribution""ù effect. In an experiment consisting of approximately 4,500 participants, the researchers observed that after experiencing moments of insight or epiphany unrelated to a specific worldview, the participants found that worldview to be more truthful. In their first experiment, their method of study was to ask participants to rate their beliefs of the world when they experienced ""aha""ù moments after solving anagrams. Their second experiment revealed that the ""aha""ù moment and the worldview belief statement had to be perceived simultaneously for the effect to occur. They ultimately found that these manufactured moments of epiphany could make certain beliefs seem truer, concluding that humans rely on such feelings to determine whether or not an idea is true or not ""î in short, they gathered that feelings influence not only our decisions to act, but our decisions to believe in something. Tree Species Sum Total It has been acknowledged that there are many trees on our planet, as well as many kinds of trees. The diversity of the trees that inhabit forests and other biomes is essential to species diversity and other factors that comprise the stability of an ecosystem. However, the task of determining exactly how many tree species truly exist on planet Earth was only recently undertaken by a research team consisting of hundreds of academics from around the world, including individuals from the ecology, evolution, and marine biology department at UCSB. Due to the difficulties of undertaking this task, mainly logistical and fiscal constraints, this determination remained only an estimation based on global data. It was estimated that total tree species richness stands at approximately 73,000 tree species globally. Among these, 12.3%, or approximately 9,000 species, have yet to be discovered. A third of these species can be considered rare, which, according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America report, highlights the vulnerability of global tree diversity due to land use and climate change.

science,UCSB Physics Researchers Apply Probability to Contextualize Microbiome,25-Feb-22,6:00 PM,"[""Seamus O'Hara""]",https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-25/ucsb-physics-researchers-apply-probability-to-contextualize-microbiome/,"The word ""stochastic""ù is not a commonly used word. The word only recently entered the vernacular of chemists and biologists when studying the organisms living in our gut, also called our microbiome. So what does it mean? ""[A stochastic process is] like rolling a die ""¶ [it means] it's random,""ù said Eric Jones, a postdoctoral researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, who received her doctoral degree in physics at UC Santa Barbara.  The success of one bacteria implanting into a microbiome has been tough for scientists to measure.†Courtesy of National Human Genome Research Institute The stochastic model of implantation by organisms ""î such as by taking up semi-permanent residence in your microbiome ""î is a recent development in the field.† Researchers do this by applying probabilities to the likelihood of a given species implanting in a biome.† ""You could say, for some species, let's define successful colonization only if you roll a one. Whereas for other species that are stronger colonizers, maybe they'll colonize so long as you roll a one, two, three or four,""ù Jones elaborated. And in their new paper in ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,""ù titled ""Stochastic microbiome assembly depends on context,""ù Jones, UCSB physics professor Jean Carlson and their colleagues discussed the introduction of the notion of context to the field. Jones was a doctoral student in the physics department with Carlson when he started to work on the published material. Instead of focusing on the individual successes of isolated microorganisms implanting in a microbiome, the report looked at how the presence of other microorganisms affects the process.† ""The context part means that the weighing of the die itself is affected by which other species [are already present],""ù Jones explained. ""[I]n effect, [nature] is rolling a die that is no longer fair.""ù This is the context present to a given species when it is given the opportunity to implant in a microbiome. A given species will have different odds of colonizing a microbiome if other species are present. Jones and Carlson introduced a weighted statistical method to quantify this contextual model of implantation. According to Jones, the human microbiome is difficult to experimentally probe as there are thousands of species present in our microbiome at any given time. William Ludington's group at the Carnegie Institution for Science and Johns Hopkins University Department of Biology instead looked at the microbiome of fruit flies that were bred to be born with no bacteria initially present in their microbiomes. Ludington is a co-author on the paper and his group contributed all the experimental data found in the report. The flies were fed a yeast compound with a known dosage of any combination of five bacteria species from the genera Lactobacillus and Acetobacter. The Ludington group meticulously fed a specific fly only one of these compounds, and each of the bacterial combinations was fed to 48 different flies. The microbiomes of the fruit flies were then sequenced to see how successful each species was at impacting the microbiomes. With 48 data points for each of the 31 possible combinations of bacteria, Jones and Carlson were able to apply a stochastic- and context-dependent statistical model to the probabilities of a given bacteria species impacting the microbiome. They compared their new method to the success of older models of species success rates and looked at the difference between their experimental results and theoretical predictions. Each of the models was considered to have ""explained""ù a bacterial species combination if the model predicted a success rate within two standard deviations of the experimental data. Independent models that do not rely on context predicted 20 of the 31 combinations. Jones and Carlson's context-dependent model predicted 24 of the 31. Underlying the urgency to this new analysis is the booming field of probiotic treatments and fecal transplants to positively alter human microbiomes. Current therapies are similar to the experiments conducted in Ludington's lab ""î some work and some don't. Not all fecal transplants are created equal; some people get categorized as ""super-donors.""ù† ""They have really good poop,""ù Jones said. ""Really good at colonizing and grafting in other people's guts. [M]aybe these super-donors have some bacteria that are strong colonizers like we've seen in our experiments.""ù† Two people can receive fecal transplants with the same goal ""î to implant a given bacteria species ""î and one could succeed while the other could fail.† The stochastic model is a scientific way of explaining random successes and failures. Jones and Carlson's new context-dependent model will hopefully expand the field's thought process on how to improve microbiome therapies. The success of one bacteria implanting into a microbiome has been tough for scientists to measure.† ""When you say how successful a fecal transplant is, it's hard to quantify,""ù Jones said. ""[You] have a sick person's gut made up of a thousand species of bacteria, and each of those species has some abundance. It's a big vector.""ù† With a context-dependent model, interactions between different species can be quantified and applied in designing better fecal transplants. A bacterial species not initially requested or required for a fecal transplant could now be important in the success of the therapy if it aids in impacting another desired bacterium. The context-dependent model could be a paradigm shift in this field. ""That's the hope,""ù Jones said. ""It would be fair to say that this is not really how people thought about [fecal transplants].""ù

science,Jacobs Lab Studies Effects of Menstruation on Brain,27-Feb-22,9:52 PM,['Nasim Elyasi'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-27/jacobs-lab-studies-effects-of-menstruation-on-brain/,"Among its multitude of functions, the brain is an expert messenger. The brain uses hormones to regulate the body, maintaining the delicate balance our bodies need to function. UC Santa Barbara psychological & brain sciences associate professor Emily Jacobs studies the brain as first and foremost an endocrine organ in her lab. The research of the Jacobs Lab focuses on the effect of sex-steroid hormones on the structure and function of the brain through many approaches. Their recent paper was published in Frontiers in Neuroscience, titled ""The Menstrual Cycle Modulates Whole-Brain Turbulent Dynamics.""ù† Despite the past research conducted on changes in the brain during the menstrual cycle, the information processing of the brain is not fully understood. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The publication demonstrates how the brain's information-processing system is changed throughout the span of the menstrual cycle, specifically in the follicular and luteal phases. Hormonal changes were assessed in the same participant ""î Laura Pritschet ""î during a natural cycle and a cycle while on a contraceptive.† The Daily Nexus spoke to Pritschet, a doctoral student in the Jacobs Lab, about the research in the Jacobs Lab, her experience with sex-specific neuroendocrinology research and the outlook surrounding women's health in the broader neuroscience sphere. According to Pritschet, the study was rigorous. As Pritschet pointed out, most cognitive neuroscience research follows many participants in a short period of time. However, Pritschet described the new trend of the field that the Jacobs Lab also used: ""tracking smaller samples of individuals many times over timescales of weeks, months, and years to provide insight into how biological factors introduce variability in the brain.""ù In the case of the current publication, the study occurred over a period of two months. The first month involved daily MRIs and fMRIs as well as blood tests during a natural (non-medicated) menstrual cycle, while the second round of brain scans and blood tests were done while the participant (Pristchet) was taking a hormonal contraceptive.† As Pritschet describes, ""When we traditionally think about an ""òendocrine organ' in the context of women's health, we often default to female reproductive organs. However, a central feature of the mammalian endocrine system is that hormonal secretion varies over time ""î sinusoidal fluctuations every ~28 days for women ""î†and this rhythmicity is essential for brain processes.""ù This rhythm is precisely what the latest publication from the lab explored. Through the use of a turbulent dynamic framework, the entire information processing of the brain was studied. The follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle were studied in order to review the effects of the cycle on the brain. The follicular phase starts on the first day of the period and ends at the beginning of ovulation, and corresponds to a sharp increase in estradiol and a decrease in progesterone. Additionally, the middle of the luteal phase shows a rise in progesterone and a relatively smaller rise in estradiol. Pritschet summarized, ""The results from these studies suggest that estrogen and progesterone have widespread influences on the human brain ""î from large-scale functional brain networks to the submillimeter scale of hippocampal morphology.""ù Overall, greater stability in information processing was found in the hormonal contraceptive regime. Meanwhile, the naturally occurring cycle demonstrated increased information processing compared to the contraceptive cycle, more so in the luteal phase.† Despite the past research conducted on changes in the brain during the menstrual cycle, the information processing of the brain is not fully understood. Sex-specific studies are also not fully prioritized, especially in women as most studies overlook menopause as a factor in their participants.. As Pritschet pointed out, preclinical investigations that study both females and males were only recently federally mandated. Additionally, she states, ""Recently, the Jacobs Lab quantified the extent to which human neuroscience overlooks all major aspects of the human condition relevant to women (e.g. menstrual cycles, hormonal contraceptive use, pregnancy, and menopause). After examining over 1,000 articles, we found that fewer than 3% of articles from top brain imaging journals in 2018 considered any of these factors in their study design""îhalf of which used these factors as justification to exclude women from participating.""ù However, the Jacobs Lab remains hopeful as they push for the application of the latest advancements specifically to the study of women's brain health. Beyond the scientific applications, they remain pioneers in their inclusion of female researchers. ""My frustration with an adopted convention that underrepresents an entire sex fueled my commitment to use my voice and leverage the broader impact of my work to advance women's health,""ù Pritschet said. ""Scientists must not overlook the simple variables that may ultimately have the farthest reaching implications. Half of the world's population is made up of women ""î putting a priority on women's health research is long overdue.""ù Comments are closed.

Coastal regions specifically face these impacts in great variety, with direct connections between anthropoid-related actions and the decline in biological life. Unfortunately, with much variation in the data collected by biologists, it has been difficult for scientists to characterize the extent of the damage being done to ecosystems without exhausting resources and datasets. In response to this obstacle, researchers from UC Santa Barbara, UC Los Angeles and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey are currently working together to create a simplified risk assessment framework that is relatable to global scenarios and would be responsible for quantifying the potential for ecological diversity loss within specific ecoregions.† With the use of already-established knowledge of marine life, including mangroves, seagrasses and stony corals, a ""weighted risk scoring system""ù can be derived to rank scenarios based on their risk of causing† biological loss in biogenetic habitats. With the ability to efficiently predict environmental degradation, scientists can prioritize conservation efforts in reach of the best outcome.† Cynical Seniors As individuals age, their perceptions of younger generations become increasingly unfavorable. John Protzko and Jonathan Schooler, both researchers at UC Santa Barbara, have conducted two studies on adults that evaluate their tendency to believe that the generalized youth possess traits that are both different and worse than from when these surveyed adults were young. With cases using 2,764 American adults, patterns show that the research participants hold a harsh standard toward younger populations. Certain individuals who believe in the unchanging nature of personality showed more amiable thoughts toward the youth, given that they themselves may possess a few of the relating traits. On the other hand, those who do not believe that they possess certain negative traits have been shown to believe that younger generations have increasingly adopted them. For example, one who is hygienic would believe that the youth are becoming progressively insanitary. The research for the cause of these common beliefs continues to develop.† Wealth Isn't Health† There is a common belief that a nation's health is dependent on its wealth. The world, having witnessed the global responses to COVID-19, has seen firsthand the inefficiencies of some very wealthy countries in containing and eradicating the virus in comparison to the successes of other less wealthy nations. UCSB professor Jan Nederveen Pieterse explained how health is dependent on factors unrelated to the economy. Pieterse claimed that, when there is a high concentration of wealth, privatized corporations benefit more financially than the common consumer, which results in public health crises rather than reassurance of better care. Pieterse established that the perfect framework for public health is tied to three important factors: collective knowledge and social experience, the state's capability to act decisively and the social cooperation of the public. Market economy also has an effect on response capabilities. In countries such as Denmark and Germany, ""coordinated-market economies""ù tended to do better than the U.S.'s ""liberal""ù and Cuba's or Vietnam's ""developmental state-led""ù market economies.† Unfortunately, Pieterse concluded that there is little hope for the nations to change. This is due to past dependency, the great influence of corporations and the reality that learning requires repetition.

science,Simply Stated: Why Do We Cry When We‚'re Sad?,3-Mar-22,4:00 PM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-03/simply-stated-why-do-we-cry-when-were-sad/,"With finals week coming up, along with the numerous other stressors in our lives, I'm sure many of us may be ready for a good cry. Have you ever stopped to think, though, about why we cry when we're sad or stressed, and whether there is actually a biological reason behind it? I never had, until I found myself reading about hormones in my biology textbook.† Audrey Kenyon / Daily Nexus Many species, humans included, use crying as an instinctive response to pain or physical irritation, which, on a basic level, makes intuitive sense ""î tears are one of the body's primary lines of defense in blocking contaminants from entering the eyes. Tears contain lysozymes, which are antibacterial enzymes responsible for breaking down pathogens that find their way into the eyes. Tears also lubricate the eyes and protect them from dirt and grit, and anything else that might be harmful to the organism.† Tears, therefore, have a very specific biological function in protecting animals from the outside world. Okay, so hopefully you're with me so far and all of this makes sense. You may be asking, though, ""When I look at the chemistry homework I haven't started yet that's due at midnight, there's no physical assailant involved, so why do I find myself shedding tears?""ù† Tears, in response to highly emotional and stressful situations, remain a mystery to the scientific world. Even Charles Darwin once described emotional tears as ""purposeless,""ù and honestly, can we blame him? There is no obvious explanation for why we secrete protein-rich liquid from our eye sockets any time we feel strong emotions. People have been trying to come up with an answer to this pesky question for centuries, and current theories range from crying as a social signal of an inability to cope and a request for help to it being a response to our brain sensing a stimulus overload. There have even been studies that found that crying elicits more empathy and less aggression from the people we interact with.† To make matters even more complicated, we also cry when we're happy! Talk about having issues ""¶ Anyway, because tears contain ""leucine enkephalin,""ù neurotransmitters which act as natural painkillers, ""tears of joy""ù as they're often fondly referred to, can also contribute to a feeling of post-cry relief. Scientists believe that we cry in times of extreme happiness, such as at weddings or when we see a cute baby, because, just as tears in times of sadness make us feel a bit better, tears can intensify feelings of happiness. Another possible reason for tears of joy is that sometimes the amygdala, the center of emotional processing in the brain, confuses feelings of joy with those of pain or sadness. When these emotions get mixed up, the body stimulates the production of tears to help you calm down from whatever trauma it thinks you're experiencing.† So, what actually happens in the body when you watch that sad movie or see your significant other walking down the aisle? The first thing is that the amygdala sends a signal to the hypothalamus, which in turn activates the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is responsible for unconscious responses to stimuli, such as heart rate, respiratory rate and digestion. There are a few more intermediate steps, but basically, all of this stimulates your sympathetic nervous system (or the ""fight or flight""ù response) and results in the release of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger which is then sent to glands in your eye sockets, inducing the production of ""î yeah, you guessed it ""î tears!† Scientists have actually discovered that the chemical makeup of emotional tears is different from the makeup of ""normal""ù tears, and contains many more proteins than the tears that we shed in response to pain or bacterial invaders. Some of them even hypothesize that this may be a part of the reason that we often feel better after we have a good sob sesh, while others claim that there is no substantive evidence for crying having any measurable effect on mood.† This brings us to another point that scientists are trying to figure out: What about people who just don't cry? Well, we don't really know yet. Ongoing studies, though, are being dedicated to discovering whether those people have significant neurological differences and social patterns than people who cry on a regular basis.† It may not matter much to you when you are sobbing down at Campus Point, reaching for the tissues at your best friend's wedding or even texting someone a tear-face emoji, but the simple act of crying is the source of much mystery in the scientific community, and undoubtedly will remain the center of significant research going forward.† I crie evrytiem

science,Back in Bloom: Flowers Begin Their Return to the South Coast,3-Mar-22,8:00 PM,['Sean Crommelin'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-03/back-in-bloom-flowers-begin-their-return-to-the-south-coast/,"The first day of meteorological spring has dawned just as I write this, bringing with it promises of showers, flowers, warming weather and ""î later on in May ""î the return of California's persistent and often spoken-of marine layer.† So ""î while we await May gray ""î let's talk about these flowers.† Southern California's native wildflowers exhibit a dazzling array of colors, shapes, sizes and timing of blooms. Nestled in the California floristic province, a biodiversity hot spot marked by a Mediterranean climate ranging from Southern Oregon to Northern Baja California and bounded on the east by the towering, well-watered Sierra Nevada mountains, the Santa Barbara area lays claim to about 2,000 species of native plants. Woolly bluecurls (Trichostema lanatum), a small, fragrant evergreen shrub, pictured in the Santa Ynez Mountains north of Santa Barbara. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus California hummingbird sage (Salvia spathacea), pictured in Wills Canyon above Ojai. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus Even as January and February proved themselves to be a tragic bust in terms of precipitation, prodigious rain in December has brought with it a crop of verdant growth throughout Isla Vista and all of the South Coast.† In addition, in the coast zone and coastal mountain ranges, it should be noted that a wet year does not necessarily translate to a stunning floral display anyway.† ""Wet years are usually great in the desert, but here ""¶ wet years tend to be full of exotic annual grasses. Big grass years are generally not good wildflower years,""ù according to Carla D'Antonio, a professor in the UCSB Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department.† While one may journey to Ellwood or the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains to find fresh crops of invasive mustard, there is also a wealth of native flowers that will begin their blooms in greater numbers as March progresses and continue onward to April, May and even early summer. It was a fact that a professor of mine from the midwest often lamented, wanting some relief from her incessant allergies: the seeming constancy of blooming and flowering all throughout the Santa Barbara area.† This lineup includes such specimens as the iconic California poppy, various species of lupine, the wild morning glory, bush poppy, California hummingbird sage and woolly blue curls, to name only a few standouts.† The timing of flower blooms largely depends on temperature and elevation. One can expect places like Figueroa Mountain, the broad, pine-studded peak looming over Los Olivos, to harbor blooming events later this spring, likely during late March and early April. If you are up for an adventure in early summer, traveling to the upper reaches of the Los Padres National Forest ""î the Chumash Wilderness atop the almost 9000-foot-high Mt. Pinos ""î will reward you with panoramic views of the mountains north of Santa Barbara and, if the snows have been plentiful enough, acres of floriferous fields of scarlet paintbrush.† A patch of scarlet paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) atop Mt Pinos. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus  Sites closer to the coast, as well as the lower, south-facing slopes of mountains ""î which tend to be hotter and drier owing to their direction relative to the sun ""î have already started blooming in many places. Walk over to the horse stables west of Isla Vista to catch a glimpse of some fledgling California poppies, for instance. In Del Playa Open Space, the protected parcel of land west of Sea Lookout Park, a field of nonnative wild radish intermixed with coastal goldenbush awaits. Locally, one can expect to find good flowers in areas without a lot of built-up vegetation, according to D'Antonio. In particular, sites burned by the recent Thomas, Whittier and Cave Fires may have a solid showing of flowers. However, fire can also harm native wildflowers and other plants by encouraging and facilitating the spread of nonnative vegetation, notably annual grasses and other flowering plants like mustard. Studies looking at the Santa Monica Mountains to the southeast of Santa Barbara, for instance, have documented a decadal transition to nonnative grassland in many parcels of land impacted by repeated fires.† A recently burned landscape with a profusion of new growth in the Santa Ynez Mountains. Sean Crommelin / Daily Nexus In addition, drought and development alike pose long-term threats to many of California's most iconic blooms. The particularly heinous drought year of 2021 was marked by parched, dry landscapes even in the peak of spring in many places throughout California, including the Carrizo Plain National Monument to the north of Santa Barbara.† Drought years are particularly difficult because invasive plants can outcompete native annual wildflowers, which generally need more precipitation to spread and bloom than their counterparts. Year over year, this can lead many native plants to become displaced in what was once their habitat. Coupled with increasing development projects in many regions, which can make wide swathes of habitat unsuitable and also lead to the spread of nonnative species in adjacent land, wildflowers face a smorgasbord of challenges.

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,31-Mar-22,9:00 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-31/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-9/,"(Re)cognition According to the organization Therapeutic Pathways, approximately 75 million people worldwide are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD,) which corresponds to almost 1% of the global population. While extensive research has been done regarding ASD and certain traits people with the disorder may possess, much is still unknown regarding the specific psychological mechanisms that lead to these traits. Hongbo Yu, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara, helped devise an experiment to try to tackle some of the looming questions regarding these mechanisms, including the relative personality dimensions of people with ASD and those without, as well as both groups' association between personality dimensions and facial recognition ability. Professor Yu, along with colleagues from West Virginia University, Dartmouth College, and Washington University in St. Louis, collected personality and facial recognition data from a large group of online participants, consisting of 89 self-identified ASD and 307 neurotypical controls, and then compared the data from neurotypical participants to that of participants diagnosed with ASD. They found that while people diagnosed with ASD did not differ significantly in personality dimensions such as empathy and social agreeableness, they exhibited altered neural coding of the specific social traits of trustworthiness and warmth, and thus were weaker than the control participants in their association between their own prosocial personality traits and their ability to judge the traits of trustworthiness and warmth in others. The study concluded that autistic traits are closely related to social anxiety and avoidance, but independent of empathetic and moral preferences, and ultimately shed light on the underlying mechanisms that can lead to certain social difficulties common with people diagnosed with ASD.† Ancient Grains New evidence from Belize suggests that more than half of the ancient Mayans' ancestry can be traced back to early hunter-gatherers who migrated from South America a few thousand years ago, and who may have brought along a crop that would become one of the main sources of sustenance for one of the ancient world's most famous cultures ""î maize. Corn has always been known to have played an important part of Mayan culture, but until recently researchers had no idea just how critical a role it played in the birth of Mayan civilization. Since 2014, researchers have unearthed more than 80 preserved skeletons from shallow graves in the Bladen Nature Reserve in Belize. This discovery allowed researchers to analyze DNA samples from the skeletons and compare them to the DNA of both ancient and living inhabitants of certain regions throughout Central and South America. They found that the more recent skeletons, dating from about 5600 years ago, contained DNA closely resembling that of a group of Indigenous people who today live from northern Colombia to Costa Rica. These findings suggest that approximately 5000 years ago there was a massive migration of people from further south up into the northwestern part of Central America, an area which would eventually become the home of the Mayan people. As for the relationship between the influx of migrants and the origin of maize cultivation, archaeologist Douglas Kennett at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has an answer. From analyzing teeth of these ancient hunter gatherer skeletons, it has been found that maize likely accounted for less than 10 percent of their diet, while skeletons dating from the post-migration period reveal maize accounting for about 10-50 percent of their diet. This evidence indicates that the early hunter-gatherers likely introduced new and improved maize plants, as well as a novel system of cultivation, into Central America when they migrated, ultimately influencing the development of one of the largest cultures of the Mesoamerican world.† Beating the Heat: While there is substantial existing data on the effects of extreme heat on human productivity and health, as well as new data on the health implications of COVID-19, researchers are now curious as to the joint effects of both of these factors. Professor David Lopez-Carr of the University of California, Santa Barbara, along with other contributors, helped lead research studying the effects of extreme heat and COVID-19 specifically on farmworkers, as they are one of the most susceptible communities to COVID-19, the least likely to get immunized, as well as the most exposed to extreme heat. While the paper has only been provisionally accepted into ""Frontiers in Public Health,""ù Lopez-Carr and his team present questions regarding further research on this topic as well as outline potential policies, which if implemented could lead to enhanced wellbeing for farmworkers, through increased unemployment benefits and better labor regulations.

Photo by Ida Kazerani. On Monday, April 4, UC Santa Barbara's Interdisciplinary Humanities Center hosted a lecture ""î the latest in their annual Public Events Series ""î- by science writer and journalist Elizabeth Kolbert, who spoke to an engaged and energetic Corwin Pavilion audience about her newest book, ""Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future.""ù This year, the program's theme is ""Regeneration,""ù and, according to the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC)'s website, the series aims to bring together both local and international voices from various humanities fields to discuss ""institutional transformations, creative expressions, activist interventions and philosophical recalibrations needed to establish foundations of solidarity upon which new futures can be realized.""ù† If anyone is well versed in the current problems that humanity faces and is prepared to speak on the ways in which we can attempt to solve them, it is Kolbert. An accomplished staff writer for the The New Yorker, Kolbert has received many awards for her writing and for her work in journalism. Most notably, she was awarded the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction for her book ""The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History,""ù which looks at the five major extinctions throughout our planet's history, as well as the sixth extinction which Kolbert argues we are currently experiencing. Her new book, ""Under a White Sky,""ù discusses humans' effects on the environment and explores whether we can hope to make an impact for the better and save our planet once and for all. It also looks at what technological tools we have at our disposal that may help us fight the climate crisis.† In Monday's talk, Kolbert addressed several topics that she discusses in ""Under a White Sky,""ù including problems such as atmospheric warming and the possibilities and implications of technologies like gene editing and geoengineering. Kolbert introduced herself as an environmental reporter and emphasized that she does not see herself as an advocate.† ""I'm a journalist,""ù she said, ""which is to say an observer. I don't really see my role [in terms of] telling people what we should be doing or where we should be going, but to report what we are doing [and] where we are headed.""ù† She also mentioned that the stories she writes about have ""largely been concerned with stories of decline and disaster,""ù topics that she said don't directly relate to the series' topic of regeneration except ""insofar as the damage we're doing to the planet makes regeneration critical to our future.""ù† She began by telling a story ""î a fable, she called it ""î about the cane toad, a species of toad native to Central and South America which was introduced to Australia in the 1930s to try and mitigate the effects of beetles on sugar cane plantations. However, the species has ended up proliferating, and due to its high levels of toxicity, has wiped out entire populations of native predators. Kolbert then talked about efforts that Australian scientists are making to use gene-editing technologies to alter the specific enzyme that makes the toads' secretions deadly, hoping to gain control over the toads' destruction of native animal populations. The cane toad has become emblematic of the current problem of invasive species and served as a very pertinent introduction to the evening's theme of ""regeneration""ù and the struggles we are facing in trying to solve the myriad of problems we have created. It also reminds us that attempting to solve such problems by imposing even more levels of human control on the environment can often only serve to make the system worse.† Another example that Kolbert gave regarding the stubborn nature of humans to opt for more and more control, instead of scaling back or changing our lifestyle to better adapt to our environment, is the significant issue of flooding in New Orleans, Louisiana. When New Orleans was first established by the French in the early 18th century, quite soon after the first buildings were erected, the Mississippi River flooded and left parts of the new city submerged for many months. However, instead of moving to a different area away from the river, the settlers decided to put levees in place to help quell the floods. And the city continues to do this to this day, despite global warming and devastating flooding caused by storms such as Hurricane Katrina. In telling this story, Kolbert made the point that while these feats of engineering are impressive and cutting edge, they are not sustainable, long-term solutions.† Kolbert also made it clear that we should be very wary about using powerful techniques such as gene editing or geoengineering to ""fix""ù our problems, such as those of invasive species or increased levels of atmospheric CO2, and that instead we should be focusing on scaling back our current harmful practices. At the same time, she admitted that we aren't exactly succeeding in doing that. ""While scaling back is not just a good idea, but probably now a necessary idea, the exact opposite seems to be happening,""ù she said regarding recent news headlines of record high carbon dioxide emissions and rainforest deforestation.† In response to these points, an audience member asked where that leaves us in terms of possible solutions to the climate crisis and what we as a society should be focusing on. Kolbert responded that ""it leaves us right where we are ""¶ and that we should be focusing on doing a lot more with a lot less.""ù She went on to say that ""we are in a pretty terrible bind right now, but that doesn't mean that all is lost, or that all hope is lost, but it does mean that there is no easy answer here.""ù† While the situation appears bleak, Kolbert still hopes that if we can collectively decide to make immediate, drastic changes to the harmful practices at the root of all climate problems instead of exploiting technology we don't necessarily have the capacity to fully understand, we can mitigate some of the worst effects of climate change. The challenge, however, is that while ""[w]e turned out to be technologically extremely capable, we are socially not very capable.""ù

science,Simply Stated: Why Do We Get Hungover? Can You Avoid It?,7-Apr-22,9:01 AM,['Kristin Cheung'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-07/simply-stated-why-do-we-get-hungover-can-you-avoid-it/,"Science & Tech is excited to bring you our first research-driven, official ranking list of alcohols! Well, not really. Studies do show, however, that some drinks are better than others if you're trying to avoid a bad morning after. Let's start by considering why we get hungover. Scientists still do not fully understand what causes the hangover phenomenon, but here are some common explanations. †Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it promotes urine production and leads to dehydration. In turn, dehydration results in dizziness, headaches and other symptoms commonly associated with hangovers. However, alcohol also interferes with the human body's chemical balance in more complex ways. The current leading theory is that hangovers are a result of a buildup of toxic acetaldehyde in the body. When the body processes alcohol, acetaldehyde is the first byproduct, and it is a much more potent toxin than ethanol, the original form of alcohol in beverages. Acetaldehyde is a carcinogen, meaning that it can potentially cause cancer, and has been shown in controlled studies to cause sweating, nausea and vomiting, among other symptoms.† Hangovers may also be the result of alcohol affecting the immune system. Cytokines are protein molecules used for intercellular communication, and scientists have discovered strong correlations between cytokine activity and hangover symptoms. Usually, cytokines trigger inflammation, like a fever, in response to an infection, but studies show that alcohol consumption can also trigger excessive cytokine production, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, muscle aches and nausea, as well as changes in cognitive function and behavior. Now, let's look at hangovers across different alcohols: It's common knowledge that a greater amount of alcohol by volume is more likely to cause a hangover. Interestingly, research shows that the coloration of liquor also affects the severity of a hangover. Some drinks, such as brandy, whisky and red wine, have high levels of congeners ""î byproducts of the fermentation or distillation process. Scientists hypothesize that because the body has to break down congeners as well as alcohol, the two processes compete in the liver and cause alcohol and its byproducts to linger in the system for longer.† †In a 2013 study done by Monash University in Australia, scientists reported that brandy can have up to 4,766 milligrams per liter of the congener methanol, compared to beer, at 1-27 milligrams per liter. Whiskey can have anywhere between 102-1,247 milligrams per liter of 2-Methyl-1-butanol, another congener, while vodka has none at all. This supports the findings of a 2010 study which found that vodka contains some of the least congeners of all the alcoholic drinks. On top of that, mixing vodka with orange juice helps neutralize some of the congeners, further reducing the time spent by the body breaking them down. To conclude, in addition to staying hydrated, avoiding imbibing on an empty stomach and taking into consideration the ABV (or proof), you might also want to look up the congener content in your drink of choice. While you're at it, add a little orange juice for a bonus dose of vitamin C.

According to a study by RAND Corporation, women have reported a 41% rise in their heavy drinking episodes in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is well known that the consumption of alcohol hinders the crucial cognitive developments of adolescents and young adults responsible for skills including but not limited to balance, motor coordination, memory and decision making. However, research reveals that excessive alcohol intake also influences the functionality of individuals during mature adulthood, when the brain is fully developed. Researchers from the UC Santa Barbara Psychological & Brain Sciences Department, Eliyana Van Doren, Leo Jimenez Chavez and Jacob Matalon, have tested the effects of the adjusted Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) procedure, a mouse model of binge-like alcohol intake, on both male and female mice over the span of a month.† Results found negative impacts on the females' spatial recall and males' reversal learning abilities, both having difficulty completing the set tasks, such as navigating through mazes and using memory to retrace steps. Female mice additionally exhibited increased difficulty with the memory of platform locations. The data suggests that, should the studies on mice relate to human subjects, heavy drinkers experience similarly increased behavioral and cognitive impact, which has the potential to cause persistent cognitive deficits and predisposition to dementia.† Communication Through Conflict While conflict is highly common, and in many cases, inevitable, there is much deliberation on the practice of resolving it in a scientific manner, particularly when practitioners desire methods for teaching conflict management styles to families and couples. They find difficulty in applying past research to their patients, as there have been few studies leading to concluded ""skills""ù and ""techniques""ù that can be taught to conflicting individuals.† Norah E. Dunbar, a professor from the UCSB Department of Communication, currently works in affiliation with Jennifer J. Summary, a professor from Florida SouthWestern State College, to compare the precedent set by current communication research literature to the findings made by Steven Winer, an educator and practitioner who specializes in anger management and conflict resolution. Over his career, Winer has developed over 4000 videotapes that reveal the behavior patterns of his clients during their ""role play""ù sessions. Through their studies, professors Dunbar and Summary hope to use the data to formulate cohesive practices that may be used by professionals across the world. The biodiversity of global ecosystems, such as coral reefs, are becoming increasingly damaged by human activity. Coral reefs are pivotal for the survival of numerous ecological communities, and the escalation in their damage requires immediate action. Unfortunately, even though there is much attention focused on revival of the reefs, most of the conducted research relies heavily on ""simplified proxies,""ù or characteristics of the environment that substitute direct measurement, such as fish biomass. As a result, conservation efforts are obstructed by the lack of quantitative assessments honed on the ""multiple process-based ecosystem functions,""ù according to Deron E. Burkepile, a researcher from the UCSB Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology. Burkepile is currently working alongside marine specialists and researchers across the world to quantify five key ecosystem functions that are mediated by the coral reef wildlife. The results of their studies reveal how the community structures of the reefs vary such that none can maximize all functions. Locally, functions are dominated by only a few species; however, according to the research, the dominant identities of marine species vary greatly on a global scale. The data illustrates that efficient conservation efforts require approaches designed for local communities with multiple ecological functions that span beyond ""standing stock biomass.""ù Comments are closed.

science,COVID Q&A,8-Apr-22,2:59 PM,['Devanshi Tomar'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-08/covid-qa/,"The campus masking policy lifted this week, bringing the promise of a direction toward normalcy on our campus. Still, there are concerns, especially among those immunocompromised, about how to protect yourself against COVID-19 as requirements for masks are loosened.† Our Science & Tech section sat down with Dr. Vejas Skripkus, M.D. who is the executive director of UC Santa Barbara Student Health, to answer questions submitted by readers last week.† How safe is it if you're wearing a KN95 in a room full of unmasked people? Is it worth it to wear a mask if no one else is wearing a mask?† ""A respirator like the KN95/N95 offers the best additional recommendation to protect against acquiring COVID-19,""ù Skripkus said. There are still lower odds of a positive COVID-19 test result if a mask is worn among others who are not wearing a mask, although there is less protection than there would be if everyone was wearing a mask. Being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations, according to Skripkus, is of the utmost importance when considering how to protect yourself against COVID-19.† Does taking your mask off just to get a sip of water make a big difference in terms of exposure? No, it doesn't make a big difference. You are most likely to catch COVID-19 if you are less than 6 feet away from an infected individual for more than 15 minutes.† Are surgical masks still worth it to wear and is it better than no mask at all? Surgical masks are less effective than KN95 masks but are still better than no mask at all. When you inhale through a KN95 mask, both large and small particles are filtered out. Surgical masks are mainly meant to protect against droplets, and you may still be susceptible to COVID-19 if there are smaller particles in the air.† Can professors ask us to wear our masks? ""As we enter the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the responsibility for masking will lie on the individual,""ù Skripkus said. Professors may still recommend students to wear their masks in the classroom, but there are no consequences if students elect not to, as there is no longer a university-wide mask mandate to be enforced. Overall, as we transition to a phase where one's level of protection against COVID-19 is up to their judgment, it is important to respect people's wishes and their level of comfort should they ask you to wear a mask, especially those who are immunocompromised.† What happens if someone in my lecture gets COVID-19? All students are asked to report a positive COVID-19 test result to Student Health so that an alert can be sent to those in the student's lectures or sections who may have been exposed to COVID-19. According to Skripkus, Student Health will continue with their contact tracing protocol, and they have quarantine housing in place so that students may isolate themselves until they test negative. Rapid tests are available, along with surgical masks, at locations around campus, including the UCen Bookstore, Loma Pelona Center and all front desks of campus housing and apartments. N95 respirators are available at the UCen Bookstore customer service desk and the Associated Students Pardall Center. How is UCSB considering the BA.2 omicron subvariant?† The lifting of the mask mandate comes with careful consideration of the conditions that can help mitigate widespread transmission. ""Our campus has a COVID-19 vaccination rate of 98%, which is much higher than that of the surrounding community, making it one of the safest areas of the county to be in.""ù UCSB's facilities, including lecture buildings, residence halls and libraries, have been evaluated thoroughly for adequate air flow and ventilation that greatly reduces chances of transmission and infection indoors. Our campus' COVID-19 response team also collaborates closely with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and the Office of the President, and will update mask and distancing guidelines if conditions change.† How can those who are immunocompromised feel safe when the mask mandates are lifted? ""Individuals who are immunocompromised may continue to wear masks and I would encourage them to do so if they choose to,""ù Skripkus said. ""Masks including N95 masks are available at no costs for all students and employees at various locations on campus. As the CDC guidelines regarding a second booster vaccine dose emerge and the data from other countries such as Israel and Ireland continue to show benefits with receiving an additional booster vaccine dose, I would encourage immunocompromised individuals to consult with their physician to see if receiving an additional booster vaccine dose would benefit their specific situation.""ù

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,14-Apr-22,9:10 AM,"['Emma Holm-Olsen', 'Anaya Khan']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-14/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-11/,"Luca Disbrow / Daily Nexus Cracks in Quark Theory Theoretical physicists Abraham Pais and Sam Treiman proposed the Standard Model in 1975, which explains three of the four forces that govern the matter of our universe. The forces explained are electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force. Simply put, these forces all play a role in what holds subjects of matter ""î such as quarks, protons and neutrons ""î together. The fourth force, which is gravitational force, is not explained by the Standard Model (SM). This specific shortcoming, as well as the inability to describe dark matter in a way that is consistent with the model, is where Claudio Campagnari, a professor and department chair in UC Santa Barbara's physics department, comes in. In a perspective piece published in Science Magazine, Campagnari presents potential measurements that contradict the SM, specifically of the W boson ""î one of the building blocks associated with the weak force responsible for radioactive beta decay. Campagnari posits that an accurate measurement of the mass of a W boson could invalidate the consistency of the SM. Campagnari is part of the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) Collaboration as part of his association with the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Those of the CDF collaboration, Campagnari included, were able to produce extremely accurate measurements of the W boson that directly contradict the SM, as the W boson was measured to be heavier than what the SM predicts by seven standard deviations. As more and more measurements are made, not only of the W boson but of other components that comprise matter, Campagnari opines that through the work of the CDF collaboration, more cracks in the SM theory may be found, potentially leading to a stronger theoretical understanding of how the forces of the universe control how matter forms.† Sticky Science UCSB's Virgile Thi√©venaz, a postdoctoral researcher, and Alban Sauret, an assistant professor in the mechanical engineering department, recently published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal discussing fluid viscosity and how the suspension of particles in various liquids can induce diverse properties and behaviors of the liquids. Viscosity is a measure of how difficult it is to change the physical conformation of a liquid. Honey is an example of a viscous fluid, in that it is less ""willing""ù to move than, say, water. Researchers have already figured out that the presence of particles in a liquid increases its viscosity, but the mystery lies in why and how the study of particle suspension becomes more difficult at larger scales. Thi√©venaz and Sauret sought to explain this. They found that particles do not spread uniformly at very small scales, which ultimately leaves areas in a given amount of fluid that don't contain particles at all and thus act as pure fluid. Through experimentation with droplets, Thi√©venaz and Sauret observed that there is a threshold of thickness for fluids, which when crossed, makes the particles impossible to separate, leading to an effective viscosity equal to that of a pure liquid. The researchers also concluded that this threshold is dependent on particle size and concentration. These observations are an important advancement in the study of fluids and contribute crucial context for industry professionals dealing with fluids in manufacturing processes, such as coating products with varnish or paint. The findings also provide a promising foundation for further research regarding fluid composition and behavior, including the study of similar suspension systems, such as thin films, as well as liquids containing non-spherical particles, like fibers. Climate Catastrophes†† In recent years, there has been an increase in the cases of wildfire events followed by extreme rainfall in the western United States. Impacts of this continued pattern are projected to have disastrous consequences, including elevated risk for debris flow, vegetation loss and flash floods. UCSB researchers from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, Danielle Touma and Samantha Stevenson, reported the increased frequency of the post-wildfire extreme rainfall events that occurred within one year of each other. With their findings, paired with the Community Earth System Model v1 Large Ensemble, it is predicted that the joint disasters will likely increase by 100% in California and 700% in the Pacific Northwest by 2,100. Furthermore, the results suggest that the increased post-fire hydraulic risks would affect most of the western United States. It is expected that at least three extreme rainfall events will follow 90% of the wildfire occurrences in California, Colorado and the Pacific Northwest for the next five years.† A version of this article appeared on the p. 15 of the April 14 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Images like these are captured and pieced together to create a map of the entire night sky. (Courtesy of Jamison Burke and Craig Pellegrino) Tens of millions of years ago, a white dwarf star exploded in a corner of the universe. Between then and now, the light has been traveling toward Earth. Koichi Itagaki, an amateur astronomer curious about the universe, observed the darkened sky on a night in 2019 and noticed a new addition to the constellations. A sudden bright light mapped the history of the white dwarf star's violent death, a supernova, its light finally reaching the telescope's lens. Not 24 hours later and for the span of only a few weeks, scientists quickly worked to identify and analyze the event, as the luminosity of the destroyed celestial body would rapidly fade and eventually disappear.† The Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), located in Goleta, California, is one of the many worldwide observatories where robotic telescopes are designed to collect astronomical data. There are many ongoing research projects at the facility, including the current study of supernovae. UC Santa Barbara graduate student researchers Jamison Burke, Estefania Padilla Gonzalez and Craig Pellegrino work with UCSB Department of Physics adjunct professor and LCO staff scientist Andy Howell to observe and understand the data collected from the telescopes, with the goal of improving their understanding of astronomical phenomena. The researchers give insight to the operations and processes that occur among a worldwide network of 10 robotic telescopes.† While a few supernovae have been discovered manually, such as Itagaki's 2019 finding, much of the supernova identification is credited to sky surveys, in which a series of telescopes around the world are programmed to frequently capture images of portions of the night sky that, when pieced together, map nearly the entirety of it. According to Pellegrino, the variation in the sky's patterns across different times indicates the presence of celestial phenomena. ""[The telescopes] look at those images and see if anything is there that night that wasn't there the night before. That's the way that a lot of these supernovae are discovered ""¶ like blips, points of light and galaxies that pop up in these images.""ù† Through this process, around 100 supernovae are discovered every night. With the great diversity in the collected data, there is a sense of freedom in that researchers are able to study projects that interest them. ""[Graduate] students, when they come here, have tons of different projects that they can choose to work on. So it's really whatever interests them or excites them,""ù Pellegrino said.†† Despite all the observations, there is still much that astronomers do not understand about the behaviors of different supernovae, like a class of supernovae called Type IC. ""[Type ICs] are a little bit weird, just because ""¶ it's a little bit hard to classify besides saying this type of explosion ""¶ doesn't show hydrogen or helium [like other supernovae],""ù Padilla Gonzalez said. ""The reason why I also found Type ICs to be interesting is because we don't know much about them.""ù Many times, there are anomalous events that deviate from the typical supernovae. Itagaki's discovery of SN 2019yvq, for example, exhibited unexpected behavior. Burke stated that, generally, supernovae increase in intensity for a period of time, while the observed object did not.† ""They get lighter over the course of a few weeks, and the supernova did not do that,""ù Burke said. ""Instead, down in the redder wavelengths, it did brighten but the other wavelengths of light did not. So as you get into the UV, instead of brightening, it faded very quickly.""ù The findings revealed an increased amount of UV light, which is invisible to the human eye, that was not typical of most other supernovae. With less light from the visible spectrum, the lifetime of the explosion appeared to be shorter than expected. Burke's responsibility at the LCO was to explain the cause of this abnormal behavior.† The data suggested that a white dwarf exploded in a binary system, where another star orbited in close proximity. When the star's life ended with a supernova, the ejecta ""î†which is the debris ""î likely collided with the other body, causing a buildup of heat in the UV spectrum, which is not visible to the human eye. ""As it gets heated up, it'll emit extra light, and because it's so hot in the UV ""¶ that's where we think this UV excess comes from,""ù Burke confirmed. The analysis of the SN 2019yvq supernova, similar to other studies, paved the path for an informative research paper that was published in The Astrophysical Journal in October of 2021. There is always one of LCO's worldwide network of telescopes observing the night sky.† This allowed for a continuous observation of SN 2019yvq, so scientists like Burke could have more puzzle pieces to understand its odd behavior. ""The sun never rises on the LCO empire,""ù Burke quipped. The research at the Los Cumbres Observatory allows for scientists to discover and describe the everlasting unknowns of the universe. The timeline of astronomical study spans beyond lifetimes, and while individuals may never witness the entire capability of the celestial realm, the observations made can aid in mapping the narrative of our vast surroundings, piece by piece.† ""There's just so much uncertainty about what we're actually observing,""ù Burke said. ""It's so interesting to constantly be discovering new things that push the field in new directions and to have to live with the uncertainty you won't ever know everything about what's going on.""ù A version of this†article appeared on p. 15 of the April 14 issue of†the Daily Nexus.

science,Molecular Diagnostic Test Shown To Predict Early Stages of Sepsis,14-Apr-22,9:37 PM,['Josh Foster'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-14/molecular-diagnostic-test-shown-to-predict-early-stages-of-sepsis/,"There is a multitude of microbes that the human body can encounter on a daily basis. Normally, the body's immune system recognizes an infection of foreign microbes and works to remove them so they don't cause further harm. However, the body can sometimes begin to turn on itself and attack its own tissues instead of the infectious invaders. This results in a disease commonly known as sepsis.† Sepsis is an extreme bodily response to an infection that can be life-threatening if not properly diagnosed and treated. Later stages of sepsis can result in excessive blood clotting and permanent organ damage. It is estimated that around 30% of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis do not survive and up to 50% suffer from a condition known as post-sepsis syndrome. Recovery is often predicated on the stage at which sepsis is identified and treated by antibiotics, with earlier detection providing more successful recovery outcomes.† A clinical diagnosis of sepsis currently relies on the presence of specific symptoms, such as decreased oxygen saturation levels and decreased systolic blood pressure. Sepsis can be confirmed by a positive body fluid test, but this typically occurs at a later stage of the disease, if it even occurs at all. Research into early detection and treatment of sepsis is an unmet need that the Mahan Lab at UC Santa Barbara has attempted to address in a research study of over 10 years. The Mahan Lab is headed by professor Michael Mahan and explores various areas of microbial pathogenesis. A team of collaborators spanning multiple universities, including UCSB, UC San Diego and UC Davis, investigated the potential of molecular diagnostic testing in recognizing the early stages of sepsis. The researchers examined altered blood proteomics in mice after infection from various types of bacteria that are known to cause sepsis. Bacteria from strains of Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were used, among others. The findings showed a significant change in blood proteins related to septic responses that occurred quickly after a bacterial infection and well before severe symptoms, such as blood clotting and organ failure, were exhibited. Douglas Heithoff, who is one of the lead researchers on the paper and is a part of the Mahan Lab, said the ""early detection allowed early antibiotic administration, resulting in markedly increased survival rates.""ù† A deep understanding of the altered blood proteomics caused by bacterial infections can help in the development of rapid and easy-to-perform tests to indicate whether a patient is in the early stages of sepsis. Even though the benefits of early administration of antibiotics are well documented, it is ill-advised to administer antibiotics to a patient without a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis. Thus, the findings provide a framework for early-detection molecular sepsis tests to accurately diagnose sepsis in the early stages of the disease. Prospective research will continue to improve the speed at which the disease is recognized and can subsequently be treated by antibiotics.† In the future, Heithoff said he hopes ""to identify a bio-panel of early sepsis blood proteins for incorporation into existing blood tests,""ù such that patients can be accurately tested for sepsis ""in a doctor's office when they are feeling unwell but are unsure of the cause.""ù The goal is that the patient is examined, properly diagnosed and treated with the correct antibiotics well before severe sepsis can occur. Additionally, Heithoff said that ""future research will also focus on understanding the mechanism of sepsis caused by different infecting pathogens,""ù with the hope that significant progress will be made in curtailing the effects of and promoting full recoveries from all potential causes of this serious illness.†

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,23-Apr-22,3:07 PM,"['Devanshi Tomar', 'Emma Holm-Olsen', 'Anaya Khan']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-23/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-12/,"Art by Daniela Gomez Consequences of Consumption Diseases such as rabies, HIV/AIDS and ""î most notably ""î COVID-19 are all animal-borne diseases, also known as zoonoses. Priorities of global health and the study of how diseases spread are primarily impacted by the spread and rapid population growth of humans throughout the globe in just the past few centuries. The advancement of human society and knowledge has led to better sanitation, improved disease control and the development of vaccines and antibiotics. However, the burden of infectious diseases is simultaneously compounded by the domestication of animals and the deforestation and urbanization of wildlife areas. A review published on ScienceDirect involving scholars from around the world, including Susanne H. Sokolow, a postdoctoral scholar of the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute, contributes analysis to the global conversation about disease ecology. The study suggests that the second half of the past century has seen an increase in the risk of contracting a zoonotic disease, as well as an increase in the number of epidemics and pandemics. According to the publication, these trends likely represent the unforeseen consequences of the rapid globalization and development of the human race in recent years; as humans crowd more and more in large cities, consume more and more livestock and take more and more trips internationally, zoonotic diseases have more opportunities to spread, shock our socioeconomic systems and cause high rates of death. The review looks at how outbreaks of zoonotic diseases are a result of human degradation of our ecosystems and bases policy recommendations on these studies to slow down the consumption of livestock and agriculture, thus strengthening our biosecurity.† Ancient Aquifers† Fossil groundwater is a source of water that has been beneath the Earth's surface for at least 12,000 years. It is projected that this ancient form of groundwater comprises more than half of the global groundwater supply on the Earth, being stored within 1,000 meters of the land surface. Radioisotope measurements are responsible for the identification of where on the planet the natural resources lie, as well as the majority of scientists' current understanding of their distributions. Mapping where wells tap into the fossil aquifers, while relatively unknown, is important for water quality and quantity management. Researchers from the UC Santa Barbara Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, Merhawi GebreEgziabher and Scott Jasechko, along with Debra Perrone from the Environmental Studies Program, have conducted research on the global spread of fossil groundwater in order to better understand its spatial distributions and test the frequency by which stores have increased or decreased over time. The combination of radioisotopic-based fossil groundwater prevalence and well-drilling data, paired with a novel geodatabase consisting of 440 aquifer systems, revealed that the wells that are sufficiently deep enough to tap into fossil aquifers are widespread, although not directly associated with groundwater depletion, indicating that fossil groundwater is not necessarily a non-renewable water supply. This fortifies the importance of making efforts to safeguard the natural resource in order to ensure the quality and quantity of present and future water demands.† Marine Science Meets Citizen Science The COVID-19 pandemic has infiltrated almost all aspects of life on this planet, and its effects will no doubt be felt long into the future. However, one area which we may not immediately think of as having been negatively affected is the so-called ""blue economy,""ù the socioeconomic sector built on human-ocean interactions including marine tourism, fishing and aquaculture. A team of scientists from universities and marine laboratories around the world, including UCSB's Chris Honeyman of the Marine Science Institute, have launched a new global project called ""Our Ocean in COVID-19,""ù which aims to overcome existing difficulties with gauging changes in the ocean and our relationship with it. These difficulties, such as resource-intensive data collection, have been amplified by the pandemic, making it even more of a priority to develop a way to both qualitatively and quantitatively study the blue economy in order to be able to establish successful practices for a more resilient and sustainable future. The project utilizes an app called eOceans, which allows citizen scientists to document activities, such as surfing or boating, and observations of wildlife and environmental surroundings, which can then be analyzed and interpreted by professionals. The project differs from past citizen science efforts, as it makes use of a mobile app and platform which allows for real-time documentation and more user accessibility, ultimately leading to a larger and more detailed set of data. ""Our Ocean in COVID-19""ù presents a valuable opportunity for studying human-ocean relationships and hopefully will reveal concrete ways in which we can secure the future of the blue economy.

science,"Weld Lab Makes Waves, Detects Quantum Boomerang Effect",2-May-22,11:05 PM,"[""Seamus O'Hara""]",https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-02/weld-lab-makes-waves-detects-quantum-boomerang-effect/,"The dots in the center represent the average momentum of the wave packet at a given point on the time axis, which runs left to right. (Courtesy of Roshan Sajjad) In the normal world of classical mechanics, objects do not independently return to their origin after being thrown. However, one particular object ""î a boomerang ""î does demonstrate this behavior, a behavior so rare that it functions as a verb: to boomerang. In the not-so-straightforward world of quantum mechanics, many objects have been theorized to demonstrate this boomerang-like behavior. No scientist has observed such a phenomenon ""î until recently.† The Weld Group at the UC Santa Barbara Department of Physics has recently published their results demonstrating the first observation of the ""quantum boomerang""ù effect. In their experiments, they saw a quantum wave packet return to its origin a short time after being ""kicked""ù by an external force. A wave packet is the quantum-mechanical, probabilistic description of how likely you are to find a particle at a particular place and time. For the Weld Group, their wave packet is a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of lithium atoms: an assembly of 100,000 atoms held at a temperature of 10 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. To create this BEC of ultra-cold lithium atoms, the Weld Group has engineered an array of high-powered lasers and magnetic components to cool the atoms and keep them all in one place. The lithium atoms start as a solid in an oven where they are heated up to 1000 K, stripping off the high energy of the lithium atoms. Then, the lithium atoms, moving at one kilometer per second, are subjected to a barrage of lasers which are tuned to energies slightly lower than that of the lithium atoms These lower energy lasers cause the lithium atoms to scatter, emit a photon in a random direction and as a result, cool down. Doing this millions to trillions of times cools the lithium atoms to a point where they can be trapped in a magnetic field coupled to high-powered lasers, called a magneto-optical trap. By this point, the Weld Group has billions of lithium atoms at temperatures one-thousandth degrees above absolute zero.† Four more highly complex cooling steps are then completed to create the BEC. ""[We] blow off the hottest atoms. Similar to how ""¶ your coffee gets cold. The steam carries the hottest atoms [and the system gets colder],""ù Roshan Sajjad, a graduate student researcher at the Weld Group and first author of the paper, said. By the end, the researchers have their BEC of lithium atoms held in a strong electromagnetic field trap, which they use for their quantum boomerang experiments. To measure the boomerang, the lab had to let go of their hard-earned BEC and let it fly. By stopping the lasers from generating the strong electromagnetic trap, the BEC was free to move around. However, after the trap is lifted, a second laser pulse comes in to provide the ""kick""ù that Sajjad mentioned earlier. The group called this scheme for nudging the BEC packet the ""quantum kicked rotor.""ù† Similar to a surfer catching a wave at the different parts of a swell, the BEC wave packet will move at different speeds depending on where the second laser gets kicked on its wavefront. While varying where on the wavefront the BEC was kicked, the researchers measured the behavior of the wave packet's momentum. The Weld Group measures the momentum of their BEC by taking snapshots of the atomic clouds after a known amount of time. This measurement is called a ""time-of-flight""ù experiment. By knowing how much time the atoms have had to move from the central trap, the Weld Group can use the measured locations of the atoms to resolve their velocity. ""If I took an image [after the strong laser trap was released], it would just look like a blob because the momenta haven't had time to do anything,""ù Sajjad said. ""But once you undergo this time-of-flight, [you can measure the momentum of the system].""ù When the group kicked the BEC at a particular time, at half the period of the quantum kicked rotor, the momentum of the BEC averaged to zero after a few kicks. This was the first demonstration of the quantum boomerang effect, and the Weld Group hopes to use their apparatus to create more complicated systems which host the phenomenon. By engineering more complicated systems that either host or destroy the effect, the lab aspires to probe some of the fundamental features of quantum mechanics of many particles. The quantum boomerang was only theorized to exist a few years ago but relies on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that have been the bedrock of modern physics for decades. Such a quick observation of the boomerang by the Weld Group opens a new line of experimentation that probes at newly emerging predictions that seek to either confirm or deny long-held assumptions of the quantum mechanics for many particles.

science,Simply Stated: Where Did My Other Sock Go?,2-May-22,11:10 PM,['Kristin Cheung'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-02/simply-stated-where-did-my-other-sock-go/,"Art by Daniela Gomez I'm no statistician, but I'd wager that the majority of UC Santa Barbara students have experienced a case (or many) of the mysteriously disappearing sock due perhaps to faulty dorm laundry machines or the common I.V. raccoon. Luckily for us, scientists have created a mathematical model to predict the likelihood of having an unmatched sock in a load of laundry. After surveying 2,000 people in the UK and conducting detailed interviews, psychologist Dr. Simon Moore and statistician Geoff Ellis found that the main contributors to the missing sock phenomenon were the complexity of a load of laundry and the number of socks per wash cycle. Moore and Ellis created the following sock loss formula:  Sock loss index = (L+C)-(PA).† L stands for laundry size, or the number of people in a household multiplied by the number of washes done in a week. C refers to the washing complexity, calculated by the product of the number of types of loads (e.g. darks vs. lights) and the total number of socks washed in a week. P represents the subject's positivity toward doing laundry on a 1-5 scale of ""Strongly dislikes doing laundry""ù to ""Strongly enjoys doing laundry.""ù Finally, A refers to attention, a quality calculated by the sum of the following actions done prior to each wash: checking pockets, uncuffing sleeves, turning clothes inside out or right side out, as per instructions, and unrolling socks. The higher the sock loss index, the higher the probability is of losing socks.† The scientists even worked out a formula for the probability of losing a sock in a particular week, as follows: Probability of sock loss = 0.38+(0.005L)+(0.0012C)-(0.0159 PA)^3 In addition to statistical modeling, the interviews conducted in the UK found four primary psychological explanations for sock loss during the laundry process. The first is the simple assumption that someone else will take responsibility for making sure all the socks to be washed are paired correctly. The second is heuristics, or the tendency for us to be satisfied with a cursory check for a lost item instead of doing a complete or exhaustive search. Another element is confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret, identify or recall information in a way that supports one's existing beliefs or assumptions. In the case of doing laundry, confirmation bias manifests in the assumption that if there aren't any visible odd socks, the laundry will not contain any odd socks at all. Finally, simple human error can contribute to many lost or unpaired items in the laundry. For example, smaller items can fall behind or between washing machines, or they could be forgotten in the machine during the unloading process.† Ultimately, this study cannot tell you who or what absconded with the sock you left in the wash, since there are too many human variables to condense into a single formula. Nevertheless, it can definitely help you prepare your laundry so you won't start the day on the wrong foot ""î or sock!

science,Simply Stated: How Does Music Impact the Brain?,5-May-22,9:01 AM,['Audrey Moeller'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-05/simply-stated-how-does-music-impact-the-brain/,"Ruhika Nandy / Daily Nexus If you want to work out your body, a trip to the gym is the perfect solution. But, if you want to exercise your brain, it's time to crank up the tunes and listen to some music.† Listening to music involves much more than opening an app and selecting a song. A stereo system or speaker sends out vibrations that travel through the air to reach our ears, where they engage with the eardrum and are transmitted into electrical signals. These signals pass through the auditory nerve and into the brainstem, where our brains make sense of chords, harmonies and rhythms in order to perceive the sound waves as melodies.† According to a Johns Hopkins Medicine article, ""music is structural, mathematical and architectural. It's based on relationships between one note and the next. You may not be aware of it, but your brain has to do a lot of computing to make sense of it.""ù† Music activates nearly all of the brain's various networks. Because of this, the act of listening to a song strengthens connections between many different parts of the brain, including areas responsible for emotion, memory, learning, well-being, cognitive functioning and movement.† A recent survey on music and brain health conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons revealed that active musical engagement was associated with higher rates of happiness and advanced cognitive functioning. Additionally, among those who reported frequent exposure to music as a child, 68% rated their ability to learn new things as ""excellent""ù or ""very good,""ù compared to 50% among those who were not exposed to music early on.† So, what enables music to be so influential on our minds? When you listen to a melody, cortisol levels ""î a stress hormone ""î begin to drop. You also experience a boost of dopamine, which is a reward hormone that can help elevate your mood. The main area of the brain responsible for processing music is called the amygdala, which stores memories of events and emotions, making it the center of our mood and mental state. By activating a positive response in the amygdala, listening to upbeat music can improve your mood and help you achieve a significantly healthier mental and emotional balance. With anxiety affecting around 40 million adults in the United States, music should be considered a powerful complement to psychological medical treatments.† Music can benefit your physical health, too. Research discussed by Shonna Waters, Ph.D., found that listening to relaxing music can help slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure, promoting a healthy heart by enabling blood to flow more freely. Based on this evidence, music therapy could be used to increase the efficacy of blood pressure medication.† Due to music's relaxing capabilities, the incorporation of music into your bedtime routine can help you fall asleep, aid you in managing insomnia and provide a distracting stimulus for your brain that eases pain. With stressful lives becoming increasingly normalized, our nervous systems could use a little help from music in order†to release more reward and relaxation hormones.† Depending on what you need at a given time, motivational rap music can lift your spirits when you feel down, metal music can boost self-confidence before a presentation and classical music can help you relax after a long day of work. No matter what the genre, all kinds of music are sure to activate your brain and boost your cognitive state.†

science,"‚""Post Roe Frontiers‚""ù: Goodwin, Oaks Share Dialogue on Reproductive Health Policy and Justice",13-May-22,2:28 PM,"['Anaya Khan', 'Emma Holm-Olsen']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-13/post-roe-frontiers-goodwin-oaks-share-dialogue-on-reproductive-health-policy-and-justice/,"† Professor Michele Goodwin and Professor Laury Oaks discuss the past, present and future of the reproductive justice movement on May 9. The event took place on campus at Corwin Pavilion just one week after the leak of the Supreme Court's imminent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Photo by Joela Rodriguez Following the leaked Supreme Court case draft opinion that might overturn Roe v. Wade, UC Irvine Chancellor's Professor Michele Goodwin and UC Santa Barbara feminist studies professor Laury Oaks came together on May 9 for an on-campus discussion on ""Post Roe Frontiers.""ù† The event aimed to shed light on the history leading up to Roe v. Wade as well as the legal, medical and political aspects of abortion rights and bodily autonomy.† The controversy surrounding reproductive rights is not new, and the attempt to limit women's access to health care goes beyond and began before the Supreme Court's leaked majority opinion, Goodwin said.† According to Goodwin, current contention regarding abortion is the culmination of a long history of cultural and gender discrimination in this country.† ""Abortion had not been criminalized originally in the United States ""¶ the Pilgrims were performing abortions,""ù Goodwin said.† ""Abortions were being performed by Indigenous people who were here ""î carrying pregnancies to term, abortion, contraceptions, all of that.""ù† ""Abortion becomes this political hotspot at the time in which we could see the Civil War coming. And ""¶ if the Union won, there would be the abolition of slavery, and Black people would be able to live how they wanted to and on their own,""ù she continued. ""The fear about the blackening and browning of the United States was real.""ù† Goodwin expanded on how, as a result, restrictions on reproductive rights were used to maintain the large disparity between racial communities at the time.† Although Roe v. Wade had set a precedent in favor of women's rights to health care without restriction from the federal government, national abortion access was still not guaranteed to all parties, and legislation against abortion continued to be enacted on a statewide level.† Many of these new laws targeted underrepresented groups, including Black, Indigenous and people of color, immigrants, teens and low-income families.† An example of post-Roe legislation targeting minority groups is the Hyde Amendment of 1976.† ""The Hyde Amendment banned federal funds from being used in the process of terminating a pregnancy,""ù Goodwin said.† ""Essentially, what it meant is that if you're a poor woman, you're going to struggle to get to that constitutional right.""ù Laws restricting reproductive rights created obstacles for women beyond seeking abortions, according to Oaks.† ""An array of barriers to [abortion] care have been legally enacted, most [of them] since 1992 [from the Supreme Court ruling in] Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, which allowed more restrictions on abortion access because it declared that restrictions were allowed as long as there was not an ""òundue burden,'""ù Oaks said.† ""These restrictions have included waiting periods, multiple clinic visits, mandatory information/counseling, parental consent for minors' care and restrictions on hospitals and providers,""ù Oaks continued.† Goodwin stated that the expected anti-abortion legislation will likely echo the Jim Crow laws of the Civil Rights Movement era, as reproductive rights are on the precipice of the ""Jane Crow""ù period. This term was coined by Pauli Murray, an American civil rights activist and gender equality advocate. †""We're about to come into a period of ""òJane Crow,'""ù Goodwin said. ""And we are already seeing it. Where there are governors that are saying next is going to be to ban contraception ""¶ we're going to be policing when people go interstate to try to get an abortion ""¶ This is, right now, on the horizon.""ù According to Goodwin, these regulations reflect the continued limitation of medical and sexual education about reproductive health.† She said she foresees medical professionals who will be unequipped to handle the many complications that can arise throughout a pregnancy.† ""There is gestational diabetes, hemorrhaging; there are any number of conditions that are never talked about,""ù Goodwin said. ""Paying attention and building up infrastructure in that way can be important. Imagine you're in medical school, and you are not trained to know how to safely manage a miscarriage ""¶ when [the patient] wanted to be pregnant but unfortunately [they're] going to die if [they] continue the pregnancy. There are medical school students who don't know how to do that.""ù Various advocacy groups have mobilized in favor of reproductive rights over the last week after the majority opinion leak.† Though the official decision from the Supreme Court is yet to be announced, Goodwin said that a small source of consolation is that the country has faced such setbacks before.† Goodwin concluded the talk by saying that she is optimistic about a more just and feminist future.† ""What gives me hope is that we've been here before, and we've prevailed,""ù she said. ""What gives me hope is that we can do better than we've done in the past, that we can get it right this time. We can get it right in such a way that centers and includes women.""ù† Self-contradictory nonsense. If they wanted to limit browning of america then abortion was a tool for eugenics not a ""constitutional right""ù being taken away from blacks. Millions of black babies have been killed by abortions which ultimately meant millions of less black children contributing to sporty and growing up to raise families and vote. Who benefited from abortions?

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,19-May-22,9:00 AM,"['Emma Holm-Olsen', 'Anaya Khan']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-19/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-14/,"Fecal Filtration Although biofilters, a form of green stormwater infrastructure, have the capability of increasing water quality, the filtration of human pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that are found in water sourcing from stormwater runoff is not well reported. Researchers from UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management ""î Marina Feraud, Dong Li, Patricia Holden, Laurie Van De Werfhorst and Timnit Kefela ""î have studied the efficiency of a breakthrough field-scale biofilter in Southern California. The researchers tested its ability to remove microbial markers and bacterial and viral pathogens from exposed water. They observed high variability in the removal of different microbial contaminants and ARGs. The biofilter significantly removed 14 of the 17 microbial markers when introduced to a 50:50 mixture of untreated sewage and stormwater. In contrast, no significant removal was documented in the other three markers: GenBAc3, Campylobacter and HF183. The results recorded in this study pose further research potential and questions about using human-associated fecal source markers as tools for pathogen removal.† Ghost Gear Abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) have long been obstacles in the field of marine conservation and continue to pose a threat to both marine organisms and field researchers.The adverse consequences of ALDFG are vast and range from the potential transport of invasive species to the distribution of harmful microalgae. They further include the obstruction of marine vessel navigation and ""ghost fishing.""ù Ghost fishing is a process in which discarded fishing nets and other gear continue to catch and kill organisms long after fishermen have abandoned them, and is one of the most infamous results of derelict fishing gear.† The extent of the environmental impact, however, depends on the drivers (i.e., the fisheries) which, in turn, depend on the region and scale of their work as well as the characteristics of the gear they are using, such as gear type and material. Therefore, any viable solutions must be context-specific. Six researchers, including UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management adjunct professor Jono Wilson, compiled comprehensive databases in order to help streamline the development of solutions to these problems. The databases include various ALDFG causes, potential mitigation methods and ""enabling conditions""ù to effectively manage these problematic marine debris items. This study and the databases will allow stakeholders to identify mitigation approaches that can be matched to distinct, local situations so that solutions are fishery-specific. It is hoped that these databases will direct the allocation of resources in order to effectively combat this incredibly damaging phenomenon.† Food to Fumes Aquaculture and mariculture are methods of food cultivation that are becoming increasingly important for food supplies across the globe. While these methods have led to greater accessibility to food sources, their expansion has resulted in an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The influx of these gases, including methane and carbon dioxide, are large contributors to climate change. With China being the leading producer of agricultural and mariculture cultivation, UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management visiting scholar Kangshun Zhao worked with researchers from the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a study that quantified GHG emission levels that were directly from aquaculture and mariculture production in China. They analyzed the carbon footprint of the four phases of the production process (feed, energy use, nitrous oxide and fertilizers) over the course of 10 years to show the spatial distribution of the emissions. The findings showed that feed production was the greatest contributor to GHG emissions as a result of crop energy use, crop land-use changes, fertilizer production and rice methane production. The regional gross domestic product was positively correlated with emissions in every province, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6. These results revealed that China's aquaculture had a lower emission intensity compared to the findings of Macleod et al (2020) due to the higher percentage of bivalve (an aquatic mollusk) production. The results suggest that China's carbon footprint can be reduced by adjusting the relative proportion of species-group production and decreasing the amount of energy use.†

science,Research in Review,26-May-22,12:23 PM,"['Josh Foster', 'Devanshi Tomar', 'Emma Holm-Olsen', 'Anaya Khan']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-26/research-in-review/,"One Small Organism Known to Man, One Giant Potential Leap for Mankind by Josh Foster We've all dreamed about traversing the cosmos as shown in popular movies such as ""Star Wars""ù and ""Interstellar.""ù Sadly, the phenomena of traveling at speeds necessary for interstellar exploration at the human scale is one that is incredibly complex and not close to being solved. A future solution could lie within research being conducted by two UC Santa Barbara professors, Philip Lubin and Joel Rothman. The duo hope to utilize a propulsion laser that uses light as a propellant to send ""wafercrafts""ù ""î which could be the size of your hand ""î at speeds of up to 100 million miles per hour. ""Wafercrafts""ù are thin slices of a semiconductor that are fitted with protection from radiation and dust bombardment to make it more suited for space. This type of space travel would shorten the time needed to reach the next solar system to 20 years. In addition, loading a tiny organism known as C. elegans onto one of these ""wafercrafts""ù could lead to retrieval of data that may influence future human space travel. The researchers note that this project is generational, and sending humans into space is still a distant dream. However, by making significant advancements now, the research being conducted by the pair has the potential to impact future generations of space travel.† Graduate Student Develops Omicron Rapid Test Audrey Kenyon / Daily Nexus by Emma Holm-Olsen The sudden spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19 caused widespread panic and strain on hospitals and healthcare workers. Luckily, countless scientists and researchers worked quickly and efficiently to help mitigate the damaging consequences of the variant and to come up with effective solutions to this powerful force of nature. One such researcher was Zach Aralis, a doctoral student at the UCSB Department of Biomolecular Science and Engineering. Over the winter break, Aralis worked on developing a test that could rapidly and reliably detect the presence of the COVID-19 omicron variant, something which the world at the time was desperate for. ""Rapid detection of new SARS-CoV-2 variants is the first step to preventing local COVID surges,""ù Aralis stated. In conjunction with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, Aralis was able to get ahold of the omicron variant genome and already available genetic data for the first two strains, and ultimately was able to develop a way of detecting omicron sublineages BA.1 and BA.2. ""Using this method we detected the first cases of omicron here in Santa Barbara County which empowered clinicians to modify treatment strategies and public health officers to enhance contact tracing strategies,""ù Aralis said. Additionally, Aralis said that the test is ""highly adaptable""ù and will hopefully be able to be modified as needed and to serve as a template for rapid tests to detect future COVID-19 variants. Marine Researcher Works Toward Developing Degradable Bioplastics† by Emma Holm-Olsen Last year, Alyson Santoro, a marine microbiologist at the UC Santa Barbara Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, proposed a project to design bioplastics specifically made to degrade naturally. According to the project proposal, the aim is to develop ""materials for the marine environment by explicitly considering the metabolism of microbes in the environment in which they are expected to biodegrade.""ù The proposal states that these environmentally friendly plastic materials may be used to improve various marine industry applications including research apparatuses such as oceanographic sensors ""î one of the largest contributors to plastic debris in the oceans. ""More than one solution is necessary to solve the ocean plastics problem,""ù Santoro said. ""Our research is investigating whether polymers made by bacteria will degrade more quickly in the ocean and with fewer harmful byproducts than petroleum-based plastics.""ù These biodegradable plastics are a promising step in the move away from single-use plastics and toward a more sustainable future. The Black Hole by Home Audrey Kenyon / Daily Nexus by Anaya Khan While scientists have long predicted that a black hole resides at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, the physical existence of one was only recently confirmed. Joseph Farah, a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow at UC Santa Barbara and collaborator at the Las Cumbres Observatory, has worked in conjunction with more than 300 researchers around the world to capture the first image of the black hole at the center of Earth's galaxy, formally known as Sagittarius A*. Through the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, Farah and his peers have pieced together a single image of the black hole by averaging thousands of images taken by telescopes from around the globe, all of which join together to create an Earth-sized telescope. At 27,000 light-years away from Earth, Sagittarius A* is difficult to observe, not only because of its distance (scientists compare its visibility to seeing a donut on the moon), but its size. It is much smaller than M87*, the black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy that had been photographed by EHT in 2019. For this reason, the speed at which the light is warped around Sagittarius A* is much faster. Producing an image in rapid motion requires more attention and technical analysis. This groundbreaking image has improved scientists' knowledge of the greatly mysterious characteristics of black holes. The confirmation of Sagittarius A* not only agrees with the accepted laws of physics, including Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, but has larger implications for the future of science. ""My research into the development of selective dynamical imaging helps us make movies of the black holes we observe,""ù Farah said. ""If we can make a proper movie of a black hole like Sgr A*, we can watch accretion material fall directly in and have a whole new opportunity to test general relativity and probe the extremes of physics.""ù Planet Protection Program Audrey Kenyon / Daily Nexus by Anaya Khan Cosmic impact to the Earth's surface poses threats to the safety of the planet's inhabitants. The Chicxulub impactor, for example, was an asteroid that had hit Earth 65 million years ago and was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. The risk of such a dangerous collision, although rare, is not impossible, as it is difficult to predict if and when objects may be on a trajectory towards Earth.† UC Santa Barbara physics professor Philip Lubin has worked in conjunction with UCSB Department of Physics Jr. Specialist, Alexander Cohen, to propose strategies to defend the planet against the collision of space debris. The ""Pulverize It""ù (PI) strategy uses hypervelocity kinetic penetrators ""î laser-like technology ""î to break apart larger bodies into smaller fragments, which would enter the atmosphere, where the now house-sized pieces would be vaporized. This method of defense is effective on shorter time scales, in contrast to comet or asteroid deflection, which would require the knowledge of a collision course much earlier on the objects' path.† ""Humanity has reached a technological state of evolution where it can begin to seriously and methodically control its fate with regards to cosmic threats from asteroids and comets by applying recent breakthroughs in both the detection of these threats as well as new ways of rapid mitigation of these threats,""ù Lubin said. ""This combination allows us for the first time as a species to help ensure our survival and the survival of future generations from this class of threat.""ù Electrical and Computer Engineering Lab Devise Multiphoton Microscope by Emma Holm-Olsen In November of last year, the lab of Spencer LaVere Smith, an associate professor in UCSB's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, reported that they had developed a new microscope they refer to as Dual Independent Enhanced Scan Engines for Large field-of-view Two-Photon imaging (Diesel2p). Diesel2p is a crucial breakthrough in the area of brain imaging due to its ability to provide an extreme level of precision. The microscope, with its 25 square millimeter field of view, allows for both simultaneous two-region imaging and sub-cellular resolution. The microscope utilizes a type of fluorescence microscopy ""î a process which relies on proteins in a sample that emit photons of light when reacting with specific compounds. The two-photon nature of Smith's team's microscope enhances this process by reducing the amount of the resulting light that is out of focus, allowing for a clearer picture of what is being imaged. These innovations will doubtless prove useful in the advancement of neuroscience research.† Delaying Drosophila Audrey Kenyon / Daily Nexus by Devanshi Tomar During February of this year, the Montell Lab, led by Duggan Professor Denise Montell of the molecular, cellular and developmental biology department, published a paper in Nature Communications on utilizing reproductive diapause in Drosophila ""î the common fruit fly ""î to extend the viability of stem cells. Diapause is when flies halt their reproductive development in response to stress in order to save energy. Montell and project scientist Sreesankar Easwaran, who was lead author of the paper, sought to utilize this natural process to extend the longevity of stem cells. Removing a compound called juvenile hormone, a molecule that serves a function in egg production, and then reintroducing it into the flies' system proved to elongate the flies' reproductive period, making stem cells more available. The fly serves as a model organism and discoveries about its system can be connected to the more complex human system. Specifically, a method to make stem cells more viable could aid in tissue renewal and de-aging.† Bacterial Biomaterials by Devanshi Tomar Last fall, a National Science Foundation grant of $1.8 million was granted to a biomaterials research team consisting of five faculty researchers from UC Santa Barbara, the University of San Diego, the University of Chicago, Rochester Institute of Technology and Syracuse University. Their research aims to construct a design for biotic-abiotic materials that use bacteria and proteins to autonomously power polymer networks filled with water, which are called hydrogel actuators. Similar to what plants do in their cells, these actuators adjust the water concentration to move in response to stimuli like light or temperature. The team's proposed applications of an autonomous biotic-abiotic material is representative of the diversity of expertise among the members. The team consists of members with backgrounds in genetics, molecular biology, biophysics, computation and theory, fostering synergies of ideas for the implementation of this design into packaging, robotics and biotechnology.† Surviving Stem Cells by Anaya Khan Biologists are researching and conducting clinical trials with the goal of developing methods to cure blindness. The California Project to Cure Blindness-Retinal Pigment Epithelium 1 (CPCB-RPE1) is an investigational implant that works to combat the effects of Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction, which leads to degenerative, and often severe, vision loss.† UC Santa Barbara Center for Stem Cell Biology & Engineering researchers Britney Pennington, Mohamed Faynus and Dennis O. Clegg have collaborated with researchers at the California Institute of Technology† and the University of Southern California to conduct a clinical trial on live participants receiving implants of donor RPE cells. The trial has shown a 2-year survival of the donor cells without indication of inflammation or immune responses that would trigger the rejection of the implants. This result is proving successful despite the significant differences in the donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, genes that are important for disease and immune defense. However, their incompatibility with the host may have negative consequences. The clinical trial is ongoing and continues to be researched. The goal is for the implanted cells to replace those that are deteriorating, not only in quantity but in function. Comments are closed.

Little did she know, her decision would lead her down a career path, and indeed a life path, that would result in her becoming an integral part of California's public health system. Dr. Do-Reynoso graduated from UCSC with a Bachelor's degree in biology and a minor in History, went on to get a Master of Public Health from UC Berkeley and a doctorate in Public Health Systems and Services from UC Merced.† She eventually became the Public Health Director (PHD) of Madera County and served in that position for seven years before becoming the PHD of Santa Barbara County. She has also worked in a variety of public health settings, including in a community health clinic, an orphanage, a mental health department, as well as managing care at Kaiser Permanente and at the U.S. Department of Education addressing drug and alcohol use.† Some of the major public health programs that Do-Reynoso has helped establish over her time as PHD are the Office of Health Equity ""î an office that grants the opportunity to allocate resources and find other professionals to help lead the health equity effort ""î as well as the Latinx Indigenous Migrant COVID-19 Response Task Force, a team that Do-Reynoso put together with the help of UC Santa Barbara's Dr. Melissa Smith. Smith is a family-medicine physician and the Director of Health Equity Initiatives at UCSB.† This task force, which eventually became the Health Equity Alliance, is, according to Do-Reynoso, is an organization that was formed to address the fact that ""certain members of our community are at greater risk of getting infected and having poor outcomes.""ù Do-Reynoso said that not only does the group continue to have dialogues and share resources, but she and her colleagues are also able to talk and share insights with the community once a month in a space on Friday mornings called ""Community Conversations.""ù She said that she believes health equity is one of the most important areas within public health, and she has dedicated much time and effort to solving pressing health equity issues like differences in received healthcare depending on one's socioeconomic status.† That being said, Do-Reynoso also emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of the public health field and listed some examples of different fields that can overlap with public health including environmental science, communications, data and accounting.† She said that data is also very important to her and can help, in conjunction with health equity, mobilize the community and policy makers to actually make a difference. ""Data in itself doesn't mean anything,""ù Do-Reynoso said. ""So how do you take meaningful and relevant data and mobilize policymakers to change, mobilize the community to change, mobilize your public health team to change?""ù† Health equity and data go hand in hand, she explained, as health equity requires looking at where people live in order to change the social and economic conditions in their communities. ""We will need data so that we can have a compelling case.""ù Do-Reynoso said that one of the specific things she looks at is ZIP codes. ""If you live in one ZIP code that is higher socioeconomic, you most likely will have less burden of disease and you most likely will have a longer lifespan compared to someone from a different ZIP code [without] the resources,""ù she said.† ""So ""¶ my intent and my focus is building internal capacity of my team, as well as external capacity to really look at the data and form partnerships and engage [the] community to do policy change so that we can all be a healthier community.""ù Do-Reynoso advised young people, students especially, interested in pursuing a career in public health to take a public health course, like she herself did in college, get an internship, or even shadow a public health professional for a day.† The class she took in college was on the politics and policies of aging, and it ""changed [her] world,""ù she said. ""It opened my eyes to how ultimate impact in health is through policy and the allocation of resources ""¶ That [led] me to applying toward public health instead of med school and I've never looked back.""ù She also said that due to public health's interdisciplinary nature and the diversity of the field, public health can offer everyone regardless of their background or discipline a valuable experience. ""The bottom line is if you want to change the world, if you like being mission driven, and if you are interested in protecting the health of your community, public health is a space for you.""ù Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and what she has learned about handling possible future pandemics, Do-Reynoso said that while public health professionals are trained to respond to epidemics, and while she has personally had to respond to outbreaks like Ebola and H1N1, she was not anticipating the intensity or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.† ""It's been an incredibly challenging 26 months, but on the flip side it's been an equally rewarding one,""ù she remarked. ""Public health has been center stage. And so that's been wonderful to allow our community to get a glimpse at what public health does and because of that we're able to form partnerships.""ù She noted, however, that the pandemic has exposed some cracks in Santa Barbara's public health infrastructure, and so state officials and Governor Gavin Newsom are now having to allocate resources to rebuild that infrastructure. ""I think that with that investment, we will be able to hire additional staff to do the work that we need to do,""ù Do-Reynoso said. ""I think that's what's amazing about Santa Barbara is that we have a very engaged community that's really wanting to make a difference.""ù Regarding the future of public health in Santa Barbara, she said she hopes to invest in attracting students and young professionals into their public health department. ""We have UCSB, Allan Hancock [College], and [Santa Barbara City College], so all of that I see as possibilities of the next generation of public health leaders being cultivated.""ù† Do Reynoso added that the number of open positions in Santa Barbara's public health department has been exacerbated during the pandemic, and that they currently have 90 to 100 vacant positions that they are trying to recruit for across the clinic system and administrative divisions. ""[I'm] really hoping that with internships and with open positions and with more investments in partnerships that we can really open doors for graduating seniors [and] for students who are interested in a career in public service.""ù For anyone who is interested in public health but is not sure where to begin, or would like additional information regarding the Santa Barbara Public Health Department, Do-Reynoso recommends taking a look at their website which she said has everything from all of their programs and what they do to data reports, disease reports and reports on homelessness. ""I would encourage anybody interested to check out our website and let us know how we can support your journey.""ù

science,Pelicans in Peril: Recent Brown Pelican Die-off in Santa Barbara Seemingly Related to Starvation,11-Jul-22,4:35 PM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-07-11/pelicans-peril-brown-pelican-die-santa-barbara-starvation/,"While the exact cause of starvation is still unknown at this time, a few theories include abnormally strong winds (Santa Barbara gusts reached 19 mph in June) in the past few months making it difficult for the pelicans to forage, as well as the possibility of increased competition for food due to surges in brown pelican populations in the last few years. / Courtesy of Valerie Kushnerov Over the last six weeks or so, hundreds of brown pelicans up and down the California coast were either found dead or rescued and brought to local wildlife rehabilitation centers and hospitals, accounting for one of the area's more recent ecological mysteries. Until recently, researchers and rehabilitators theorized the cause of the massive die-off to be a strain of avian influenza or other contagious infection, or even a poisoning event by compounds, such as domoic acid ""î a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. The birds arrived at facilities extremely emaciated, with many having additional injuries as well.† However, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife announced in a June 24 press release that they had ruled out avian influenza, as well as domoic acid poisoning, and that the evidence points to starvation.† UC Santa Barbara professor Stephen Rothstein of the Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology department, who happens to specialize in ornithological research, also gave some insight into previous crises like this one and how the current situation has been dealt with.† ""Events like this recent crisis have occurred in the past, in 2010 and other years, and may be natural, or it's possible that ocean warming caused a decline in fish numbers,""ù he said. ""I think the public, government agencies and NGOs have all responded very well.""ù He also posed additional questions, including what the physical state of local fish populations is and whether other birds with similar food requirements, like cormorants, also suffered. While the exact cause of starvation is still unknown at this time, a few theories include abnormally strong winds (Santa Barbara gusts reached 19 mph in June) in the past few months making it difficult for the pelicans to forage, as well as the possibility of increased competition for food due to surges in brown pelican populations in the last few years. Food supply is not thought to be the reason due to a current abundance of the brown pelican's main food source: anchovies.† For about 30 days straight, the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network (SBWCN) received an average of nine pelicans a day. The birds were cared for at the SBWCN's newly constructed Wildlife Hospital and were mostly kept in a spacious back room where they were fed and washed. Once the birds had been given food, water and medicine if needed, and provided that they were doing well enough, they were allowed into an enclosed outdoor pool area.† ""Between May 14 and June 14, we rescued about 270 pelicans,""ù said Communications Manager Lauren Gonzales. ""We were transferring a lot of pelicans every day to International Bird Rescue (who has a much larger facility and capacity), so we had a lot of birds shifting in and out each day. At one point we had at least 100 pelicans in care at our facility.""ù Gonzales said the strain on the Care Network's hospital was significant; due to the enormous amount of supplies, volunteers and space required, the SBWCN was pushed to its limits. ""For perspective, SBWCN cared for about 100 brown pelicans in all of 2021,""ù she said. ""We hit this number within the first 5 days of the crisis, so needless to say it was a much bigger number of pelicans than we're used to.""ù† Each bird that arrived at the hospital needed a full intake exam, consisting of weight, temperature and hydration level checks, among other things. Once a treatment plan was developed, the birds were given fluids, food, warmth and medication if needed.  ""Not only is this incredibly time-consuming for our staff, but the cost of fish, fluids, medications, enclosures and supplies for hundreds of pelicans is really expensive,""ù Gonzales said. ""In addition, we are still in the middle of spring baby season, which is our busiest time of year for wildlife rehabilitation.""ù Nonetheless, the Santa Barbara and Goleta communities rallied to aid the SBWCN in successfully caring for all of the birds taken into their care in a touching display of resilience and teamwork that Gonzales said was ""inspiring to see.""ù Gonzales said that the situation is getting better; the number of pelicans being admitted to the hospital started to drop off after the first few days, and most of the pelicans in their care responded very well to the treatment regimens.† A total of 60 pelicans were released in the last two weeks of June, and there were only 11 birds left at the SBWCN hospital as of last week, as the rest were either released or transferred to International Bird Rescue. ""We're grateful that so many birds were able to get a second chance.""ù

science,Simply Stated: James Webb Telescope Releases First Images,19-Jul-22,2:34 PM,['Anaya Khan'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-07-19/james-webb-telescope-releases-first-images/,"Christy Yu/Daily Nexus The James Webb Space Telescope was launched into space on Dec. 25, 2021, and its abilities were expected to revolutionize scientists' understanding of the universe. On July 12, 2022, the first developed images were released to the public, and the results were nothing short of stellar.† NASA partnered with the European Space Agency (ESA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and others to create the world's largest and most powerful space telescope to date. The James Webb Space Telescope has the capability to capture and develop light, specifically in the infrared spectrum (which is invisible to the human eye) with extreme precision. It was created with the purpose to reveal the light from the beginning of the universe, estimated to be 13.5 billion years old, according to NASA.† ""Ultraviolet and visible light emitted by the very first luminous objects has been stretched or ""òredshifted' by the universe's continual expansion and arrives today as infrared light. Webb is designed to ""òsee' this infrared light with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity,""ù the Webb Fact Sheet stated.† A televised broadcast at 10:30 a.m. on July 12 from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, revealed the first four images that the telescope has developed, as well as the first spectroscopic data.† The images that had been released include the Carina Nebula, commonly known as the Cosmic Cliffs; Stephan's Quintet, the grouping of 5 galaxies; the Southern Ring Nebula, the depiction of the planetary nebula of a dying star; and SMACS 0723, the ""deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,""ù as reported by NASA. The majority of the light in the images depicts the thousands of galaxies that are visible to the James Webb Space Telescope from the given focus of its lens. Many of the smaller specs reveal light that has never been seen before.† The Webb telescope captured images of the planet WASP-96b, revealing a collection of data relating to atmospheric composition. The released model relates the wavelength of the observed light to the amount of light blocked while disclosing the specific signatures of chemical elements, specifically H2O. The initial findings have revealed evidence of not only water, but clouds and haze in the atmosphere of a gas planet orbiting a star similar to the Sun.†† The images and data published have greatly deepened scientists' understanding of the mostly undiscovered universe. Photographs of light that have never been seen before are the key to unlocking the mysteries to the formation of stars and the speed at which the universe is expanding. The detection of water in the atmosphere of planets with such precision opens many doors in the search for life and potentially habitable celestial bodies. With the James Webb Space Telescope having been launched very recently, the promise for more discovery is on the horizon. As development in the world of science and technology progresses, the shield of the unknown slowly unravels.

science,Simply Stated: What can really be expected from the Ocean Road Housing Project?,29-Aug-22,8:53 AM,"['Emma Holm-Olsen', 'Anaya Khan']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-08-29/simply-stated-what-can-really-be-expected-from-the-ocean-road-housing-project/,"With the majority of UC Santa Barbara's community affected by the current housing crisis, the administration is faced with the challenge of providing housing for the growing number of students, staff and faculty.† The Ocean Road Housing Project aims to develop up to 540 housing units for faculty and staff on the 16.7-acre stretch that resides between UCSB and Isla Vista. The first phase is scheduled to begin in late summer 2023 and one-third of the construction is set to be completed by 2025.† With the removal of the Eucalyptus Curtain, there will be noticeably less green space, more traffic and noise pollution along Ocean Road.†Despite the expected environmental impacts, these impacts might be minimized by planting native trees upon the advice of experts at UCSB. Essa Shamsan / Daily Nexus While the Ocean Road project is a step towards combating the growing necessity for housing in Goleta and Isla Vista, there are several expected negative impacts on the environment and community of the affected area.† The proposed housing units would be situated right where the so-called ""Eucalyptus Curtain""ù is today. The Eucalyptus Curtain is a stretch of Eucalyptus trees marking the boundary between campus and Isla Vista, and is home to many species of migratory birds and insects.† One such species is the endangered monarch butterfly. Biologist Adam Lambert said that while monarchs in California would historically roost in native tree species, they have taken to eucalyptus trees due to the virtual extermination of many of the state's native tree species, such as the Monterey Pine and Monterey Cypress.† ""Overall, eucalyptus serves an important ecological role in supporting overwinter monarchs in the absence of sufficient native vegetation,""ù Lambert said. ""However, the habitat potential of any given stand and implications for supporting monarch conservation efforts should be evaluated to truly understand how removal might affect butterflies.""ù He added that if the Curtain is taken down, it would be ideal if native tree species were planted in its place.† Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB) professor Douglas McCauley stated that despite his love of all trees, eucalyptus are not his highest priority. ""I'm fond of all trees for the carbon they capture and other services and aesthetics they bring to campus,""ù he said. ""But, I'm also aware that these eucalyptus are non-native species and a relatively new arrival to SB.""ù Similar to Lambert, McCauley hopes that in the event of the removal of the Curtain, it will be replaced with a grove of native oak trees.† The history of eucalyptus trees is rooted in colonialism and, according to EEMB assistant professor Leander Love-Anderegg, they stand as icons that represent the erasure of indigenous communities. McCauley additionally stated that they were brought and planted by European settlers in hopes of generating wood needed for construction. The trees did not, however, regenerate at the expected speed, and so were left to adapt to an environment they were unsuited for.† ""[It] turned out it took many decades longer than anyone anticipated to have them generate halfway decent timber so they were abandoned and have created some challenges for other flora and fauna,""ù McCauley said. The devastating legacy of the colonists is echoed in the eucalyptus trees, which continue to serve as a reminder of many of the atrocities committed against indigenous populations. In this regard, the removal of the Curtain may be a necessary step. Another potential issue with the housing proposal is the further deterioration of the line between the UCSB campus and Isla Vista. With the removal of the Eucalyptus Curtain, there will be noticeably less green space, as well as likely more traffic and noise pollution along Ocean Road.† While negative human and ecological impacts are expected, Love-Anderegg suggests that the Ocean Road area may be the best location for the impending housing construction, given that it is already heavily developed. According to him, Ocean Road may be the only place where the housing could logistically go without causing more problems. He said that the resident raptors would not be greatly harmed, although the monarch butterflies are expected to be impacted. With the initial stages of planning begun, the future of the Ocean Road project towards appeasing the housing crisis is essentially determined. Despite the expected environmental impacts, these impacts might be minimized with the potential of planting native trees upon the advice of experts. A version of this article appeared on p.11 of the August 25, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus. CORRECTION [9/26/22, 7:26 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Monterey Pine and Cypress species are native to the local area (Santa Barbara). This article has been corrected to reflect that while these species are a few of the monarchs' preferred roosting habitats elsewhere in the state, and have been decimated throughout the California coast (just as species native to the Santa Barbara area were decimated as well), they are not native to the Santa Barbara area, and were never prime monarch habitat in this location.†
Print The Eucalyptus Curtain is an ESHA and should be protected. Ocean Rd should be for much needed student housing by expanding the dorms that are already there, instead of the Orwellian Dormzilla. Hey Professor, what are all the Palm Trees a symbol of? Absolute scum take about eucalyptus trees and colonization. How can you be concerned about keeping trees which are ""echoes of colonization""ù while ignoring that the land today is controlled by HUMAN COLONIZERS without regard for the Chumash peoples who are the first peoples of this land and who are routinely excluded in decisions about the land. Of course the Nexus chooses to quote white biologist professors instead of community organizers and those with traditional ecological knowledge. Y'all can do so much better. I'm sorry""ìThe Nexus and sources need to do their homework. Biologist Lambert states monarchs would roost in trees native to the area, such as the Monterey pine and cypress, tthat they have taken to eucs due to extermination of native tree species. That is bunk as far as I know. Monterey pine and cypress are not native to south coast or SB County. They were not exterminated here. And the monarchs""ìwell, they chose the blue gum eucalypts for their unique microclimate. Ask any of us who have worked to protect the Ellwood Complex, the groves hosting migrating monarchs next door""¶†Read more ª Hi Ms Lange,  The Nexus would love to speak with you further on this topic for a follow up article.

The most recent booster shot, which targets the original strain of COVID-19 as well as the Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5, is available by appointment via the Student Health Patient Portal. Rapid testing remains available for students at the front desks of the residence halls, in the campus bookstore at the UCen, the Student Resource Building, Recreation Center and University Library.† The risk of outbreaks of the monkeypox and COVID-19 viruses are being currently monitored via data collection by the Santa Barbara Department of Public Health. As of Sept. 20, only 14 cases of monkeypox were confirmed in Santa Barbara County.† According to the CDC, monkeypox is not known to be transmitted via shared airspace and is rather spread through direct contact with the body fluids or sores of a person infected. Students not included in the priority groups for vaccines can protect themselves by washing their hands often, particularly after contact with high-touch surfaces or the skin of someone who appears to have a rash resembling monkeypox.† According to UCSB Student Health Services, a limited number of students can receive the JYNNEOS vaccine for monkeypox. The guidelines state that those who should prioritize getting the vaccine are people who have knowingly been in contact with someone who has monkeypox or ""attended an event or venue where there was known monkeypox exposure.""ù †Students who are ""gay, bisexual, and other men (including cisgender and transgender men) who have sex with men or transgender women""ù are priority groups of the CDC for vaccine allocation. In a partnership between the Recreation & Wellness and University Health departments at the University of Maryland, student health consists of eight different dimensions of wellness: physical, social, emotional, intellectual, vocational, environmental, spiritual and financial. All eight dimensions overlap and affect one another, uniquely summing up to a student's overall health and wellness. A healthy balance of these eight dimensions, the guide reads, is different from person to person, depending on one's environment and control over their circumstances.† In a survey of 30,967 participants conducted by Statista in 2021, only 39% of the surveyed college students said they believed that they were in good physical and mental health.† In the same survey by Statista, 23% of respondents reported feeling fatigued every day in the week before they took the survey. 41% of respondents said they experienced symptoms of depression in the last year. 26.9% of students reported a diagnosis of a respiratory illness in the last 12 months before they took the survey.† The beginning of the year marks a period of adjustment for many students as they experience new living situations and new campus involvements, matching their current involvements to an ever-changing set of goals for the future.† According to a guide by the University of New Hampshire, being healthy is more than not being sick. Physical wellness specifically requires informed choices when it comes to precautions against illness and infection, alcohol, eating, reproductive health, sleep and stress management.† A wellness map detailing where resources like condoms, menstrual products, hydration stations and rest chairs are located on campus can be found on the UCSB Health and Wellness website.

science,Simply Stated: What‚'s Going On Up There?,29-Sep-22,10:57 PM,['Anaya Khan'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-09-29/simply-stated-whats-going-on-up-there/,"Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Jonah Hill, Meryl Streep and many more famous celebrities played their parts in the 2021 film ""Don't Look Up,""ù the satirical cinematic piece that represents the political response to climate change and impending doom. The premise follows the future arrival of a comet that is expected to wipe out the human population, and a government and society willing to ignore the threat of extinction (with the eventual adoption of the mantra ""Don't Look Up""ù).† Fortunately for those on this universe's Earth, no such danger from space has been discovered as the general population is aware. In fact, the recent astronomical news suggests that the plot of the movie will become less of a threat in the upcoming future. Scientists at NASA have found success in the world's first planetary defense mission, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test. In its aim to test the adjustment of asteroid and comet trajectories, the project may have the potential to redirect the course of any future Earth-threatening celestial object. With kinetic impact technique, a spacecraft that has been navigating toward its destination ""î a small asteroid moonlet Dimorphos ""î for 10 months has intentionally and successfully collided with its target on Monday, Sept. 26, slightly shifting its path.† While individuals on Earth may never face the same situation as the nearly entire celebrity cast of ""Don't Look Up,""ù they currently have the opportunity to look to the sky for rare occurrences that are less life-threatening. Not only are many of the well-known constellations currently visible in the northern hemisphere, including Sagittarius and Scorpius, but there is a possibility for amateur astronomers to witness an event that has not occurred for nearly six decades, according to NASA journalist Beth Ridgeway.† ""Jupiter's opposition occurs every 13 months, making the planet appear larger and brighter than any other time of the year. But that's not all. Jupiter will also make its closest approach to Earth since 1963,""ù Ridgeway said.† Opposition occurs when a planet and the sun are on complete opposite ends of the Earth. Due to the planets' elliptical orbits, the distance between them varies throughout their journeys around the sun. The opposition paired with the close proximity of the planets allows for an extremely bright and visible sight.† ""A good pair of binoculars should be enough to catch some details,""ù NASA tweeted. While the exact point of opposition occurred on the night of Monday, Sept. 26, the planet will continue to shine bright for several days and maybe weeks following.† A few of the rare views of the planets cannot be seen by the naked eye. Neptune's rings, for example, were recently captured by the James Webb Space Telescope in infrared light. According to NASA, new images of the rings have not been seen in over 30 years, when NASA's Voyager 2 flew by the planet in 1989. The recently launched telescope also depicts 7 of the distant ice giant's 14 known moons, including Galatea, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Proteus, and Larissa. The most visible of the moons is Triton, which even outshines Neptune itself as a result of its methane rich atmosphere and frozen surface of condensed nitrogen that reflect 70% of sunlight that hits it.† While there has been much discovery in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics, there is potential for even more with the continuous progress in technological advancement. NASA's Artemis 1 rocket launch is expected to launch in the very near future (the exact date is pending and dependent on weather and launch windows), and the first mission to our closest celestial neighbor since Apollo 17 expands the potential for space exploration and human presence on the moon. With missions such as these and more expected in the years to come, including launches from the expanding spacecraft engineering corporation, SpaceX, the probability of long-term human presence in space increases.† The comets and asteroids that have caused mass extinctions and set the premise for many planet-murdering movies may no longer hold the weight of terror they once did. Instead, the actors of the thriller films may soon find the characters for villain and victim reversed. In a matter of time, humankind will collide with the astronomical objects first.†

Following months of delays and several scrubbed launch attempts throughout September, the company's 95-foot-tall Alpha rocket finally took flight at midnight on Saturday.† The 119,000 pound booster soared through clouds that entirely impeded its view from the coast, heading westward toward an orbit that ran opposed to the rotation of the Earth.

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,13-Oct-22,11:06 PM,"['Emma Holm-Olsen', 'Anaya Khan']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-13/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-15/,"Bye-Bye Bias† Methods of data collection are required in order to conduct many research studies and social experiments. Multiple price lists, for example, are a procedure that helps researchers determine an individual's desire and willingness to purchase products or services of use. This process asks participants to fill out a table comparing an object to its price, where they then mark ""yes""ù or ""no,""ù indicating whether or not they would buy the product. While this method is a simple procedure, there is evidence of bias and high error rates. Choice patterns including ""multiple switching""ù and ""never switching""ù have the capacity to further skew the results of such experiments. These effects are made apparent by a South African choice experiment that revealed discrepancies in subject preferences as a result of order changes. In order to combat the often incorrect conclusions, UC Santa Barbara researcher B. Kelsey Jack has worked in conjunction with Kathryn McDermott and Anja Sautmann from Cape Town, South Africa and the Development Economics Research Group of the World Bank in proposing a new method of data collecting. Their model uses a combination of random-effect latent utility and random approach models that would eradicate the error and bias from the data. This two-part approach randomizes the order by which the prices are shown to the participants in order to account for the possibility of choice pattern. The latent utility model is scaled appropriately in accommodation of inconsistencies and dominated choices. This process further eliminates the selection bias that commonly arises in this form of experimentation. Further development of this project paves the way for more accurate research studies and better understanding for relevant economical and scientific analysis, including the explanation of treatment effects and insight about welfare.† Defining Deforestation: While it is generally understood that agriculture is largely responsible for global deforestation, there are several forms of agricultural development which have varying levels of impact on forest ecosystems. A team of scientists from all over the world, including UCSB environmental studies professor Robert Heilmayr, has striven to shed light on the breakdown of deforestation due to these different phenomena. The foremost way in which we usually perceive agriculture contributing to deforestation is by direct causes such as forest clearing for pastures and plantations of crops such as palm oil, soy and coffee. However, despite causes like these making up the majority (~90-99%) of tropical deforestation, the researchers found that, surprisingly, only about half of that land is actually converted into ""productive agricultural land.""ù In their paper, they include a graphic that expresses that a significant portion of deforestation is due to secondary effects which may ultimately lead to that land being abandoned. Such effects include: crop booms and busts, land speculation, low suitability of land and/or inadequate management, and even fires spreading from other areas of land clearing. Additionally, they found that approximately a third of agriculture encroachment into forests is consumer driven (in producer countries.) Some examples of high-demand exports they list in the paper are beef and cereal products, which they state account for the majority of deforestation across Africa. Of course the full extent of deforestation and its causes are still not fully understood, but this team's research and analysis of existing data provide valuable insight into the topics of land use and environmental degradation, as well as provide solid groundwork for future studies.† Into the Light A team of researchers has recently discovered new details in the visual mechanisms of Drosophila. It has been documented that upon exposure to light, photoreceptors in the eye stimulate a cascade of events ultimately leading to the generation of lipids that stimulate an influx of calcium ions through the TRP and TRPL cation channel. However, the exact lipids that were produced in response to the light were unknown. In order to determine which lipids opened the ion channels, they set up an experiment in which groups of flies were placed in the dark and the light, and whose lipids were then analyzed after exposure to light. The team, including UC Santa Barbara MCDB researchers Takaaki Sokabe, Avinash Chandel, and Craig Montell, identified the endocannabinoids ""ì† molecules produced by the body (as opposed to those found in cannabis compounds) that play roles in regulating various metabolic processes ""ì that played a role in triggering the cation channels. Additionally, the authors asserted that since Drosophila lacks cannabinoid receptors that are homologous to those in mammals, TRP and TRPL must be the endogenous (produced by the body) receptor equivalents for endocannabinoids in Drosophila. The findings of this research are significant as they shed light on the already well-known and well-studied complex eye structure of Drosophila, while the broader implications are significant due to the importance of organisms being able to use their senses to better understand their environment and make educated choices based on the information they obtain.†

science,Simply Stated: Why Do People Faint at the Sight of Blood?,20-Oct-22,11:11 PM,['Ece Ozdogan'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-20/simply-stated-why-do-people-faint-at-the-sight-of-blood/,"Art by Olivia Shu I woke up on the ground next to the Student Resource Building surrounded by people who didn't know me. I was confused, to say the least, but quickly understood what had happened.† About five minutes ago, I got into a bike accident and fell, scratching my knee up pretty badly. When I parked my bike and checked out the severity of the wound, I started feeling lightheaded due to a combination of pain, shock and most importantly, the sight of my own blood trickling down my leg.† Vasovagal syncope, a type of reflex syncope, is the most common reason people faint. Vasovagal means caused by the vagus nerve while the term syncope refers to the act of fainting. It is caused by the body overreacting to triggers, such as the sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. The nerves connected to the heart and blood vessels control heart rate and blood pressure by signaling the blood vessels to either widen or contract. Under regular conditions these nerves act in coordination to provide the brain with enough oxygen. However, in the case of vasovagal syncope, the nerves might give faulty signals which cause the heart rate and blood pressure to suddenly drop. Specifically, the vagus nerve, which controls the involuntary parasympathetic nervous system, overreacts. This means that blood pools in your le gs and the decrease in the amount of oxygen reaching the brain causes a brief loss of consciousness. After fainting, blood flow to the brain resumes and consciousness is quickly regained. While the most common cause for vasovagal syncope is the sight of blood, it can also be caused by other factors, such as stress, anxiety, fatigue, distress and dehydration. The sight of blood leading to syncope can be explained through evolution. Similarly to prey feigning death in order to avoid predators, our ancestors would faint at the sight of their blood which would cause them to appear dead and avoid further conflict with rivaling cavemen. The decrease in blood pressure would slow down their bleeding which helped them survive under the pretense of having passed away. Although this was not intentionally done, it helped them overcome tough situations against their enemies.† On its own, vasovagal syncope is not a serious condition, as it does not point toward underlying brain or heart issues. However, it might lead to injury due to sudden impact, so it is important to recognize the symptoms. Prodrome is the brief period right before an attack occurs. The symptoms during this 30-second period include lightheadedness, a sudden warm feeling, pale skin, increased sweating and a sudden feeling of fatigue. If recognized during the prodrome phase, vasovagal syncope can be avoided by simply lying down. Once an attack starts, consciousness is lost for around 15 seconds, the eyes roll to the back of the head, twitching, similar to a seizure, occurs and in some cases bladder control is lost. Recovery takes around 20 seconds, and it is recommended to stay laying down for at least 10 minutes following the attack since a repeat syncope may occur. Generally, no medical attention is needed after an attack. However, if there is injury to the head, it is recommended to have it examined.† Bike accidents, whether it be minor-scale or serious enough to injure, happen on the daily at UC Santa Barbara. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the possibility of vasovagal syncope occurring and to take the necessary steps to both prevent and treat it.†

science,Simply Stated: How Do You Lessen The Toll Of A Sugar Rush?,27-Oct-22,11:17 PM,['Meenakshi Manoj'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-27/simply-stated-how-do-you-lessen-the-toll-of-a-sugar-rush/,"Art by Vanessa Fonseca Having a major spike in blood sugar has many downsides: You may experience a headache, severe energy drops the next day, elevated sugar cravings and become at a greater risk for certain diseases ""î like heart disease, type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance (Team Nutrisense). At a Friday or Saturday Halloween celebration, there is little to no chance that you won't crave a single piece of candy or chocolate. While it's important to enjoy these Howmoments while they last, there is one important thing to watch out for, which is a major glucose spike when you subconsciously munch on some Sour Patch Kids or M&M's.† According to biochemist Jessie Inchausp√©, the specific order and combination of food that you consume can minimize or exacerbate the effects of a cheat day over the Halloween weekend. In her science novel ""Glucose Revolution: The Life-Changing Power of Balancing Your Blood Sugar""ù, biochemist Inchausp√© emphasizes that the order of food matters. The ideal order is as follows: vegetables first, protein and fats second, starches and sugars last. Inchausp√© explains that by eating sugary foods and simple carbohydrates last, after having some fruit with nut butter or good quality protein, you will feel less hungry, have fewer cravings and experience smaller glucose spikes (Frye).† In addition, consuming gut-healthy foods before sugary snacks may enhance your capacity to recover from a glucose spike. These foods include fermented foods like yogurt and kimchi; prebiotic foods like green bananas and dark chocolate; high-fiber and antioxidant-rich foods like wild blueberries; unprocessed nuts or nut-butters like almonds and peanut butter; and eggs, perhaps in a frittata or egg salad. All these nutritious food categories are great ways to start a day or meal before eating sugary snacks and junk food later on. Leslie Bonci, a registered dietician and sports nutritionist, found that the best food to eat with sugary products may be protein. Protein is known to trigger the release of glucagon, a hormone that stabilizes insulin levels. According to the Cleveland Clinic, ""Glucagon is a hormone that triggers liver glycogen to convert back into glucose and to enter your bloodstream so that your body can use it for energy.""ù In other words, after a glucose spike, the hormone glucagon stabilizes blood sugar levels such that a massive drop in glucose levels does not occur. If glucagon was not there to lessen the impact of a spike in glucose, a person could experience splitting headaches, fatigue, polyuria or excessive thirst and hunger (Cleveland Clinic). Therefore, by consuming a combination of protein and sugar, such as some carrots and hummus with a fun-size Hershey's bar, protein and sugar can regulate one another. ""Our bodies are pretty darn smart in that way,""ù Bonci notes (Maldarelli). An improved diet is important, and a day of sugar will likely not do much harm. A ""bad night""ù is normal every once in a while. In order to get back to a healthy lifestyle after a sugar-overload, it's important to drink plenty of water because our bodies are 60% water and blood is 90% water. Also, try to exercise regularly ""î even just a 15-minute bike ride can make a difference. Be sure to prioritize resting your mind and body by managing your stress levels and getting adequate sleep, and most of all, staying optimistic about what's to come! The takeaway ""î enjoy your Halloween night! Don't be scared about a few candy bars but also do the best for your body: incorporate healthy fiber, fats and protein when you do have a couple of Halloween treats. Plan your meals so that your last glucose intake is your Halloween bucket.†

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,3-Nov-22,11:20 PM,['Anaya Khan'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-03/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-16/,"Mental Health Mindfulness Somatic complaints are a form of mental illness expression where individuals tend to adopt a heightened focus on physical pain, usually of symptoms such as stomachaches or headaches. This can result in extreme physical and mental distress. This manifestation of mental illness has often gone unstudied in youth groups, especially in the Latinx community, which is the largest growing ethnic group in the United States.††† UC Santa Barbara researchers Alissa Der Sarkissian, Jill D. Sharkey and Alison Cerezo from the Department of Clinical, Counseling, and School Psychology, have conducted a study that examines the correlation between the mental health of the Latinx youth and their environments. The findings revealed not only a strong negative association between somatic complaints and being a first-generation immigrant, but a higher reported rate of somatic complaints in girls than in boys. Mental health stigma often has an effect on the rates of mental illness development. Where it positively corresponds to the data, the association between somatic complaints and stigma decreased when considering involved and supportive adult relationships. The study highlighted the importance of demographics to the rates of mental illness development, where it is concluded that both gender and immigration generation status (first and second generations being more likely to experience somatic complaints than third) are factors that influence the risks.† Little Lasers † There are many important applications of lasers for different fields, including metrology, timekeeping and the manipulation of quantum systems. The expectations of these lasers require that they embody hertz (cycles per second) linewidths, where linewidths are the lengths of their optical spectrum, and that they are measured in the time scale of seconds. Unfortunately, such necessities are difficult to adhere to, as the larger bulk optic lasers and reference cavities are materials that need to be built to reduce noise. They are more costly, require labor and have limited applications.† UCSB researchers Joel Guo, Chao Xiang, Warren Jin, Lin Chang and John E. Bowers from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have worked in conjunction with researchers from other institutions to develop a compact laser system that promises similar results and has the potential for high-volume manufacturing. In this work, the researchers applied lasers with one second linewidth of 1.1 hertz. The fractional frequency instability, which is the partial spontaneous frequency change in a specific time interval, is within the range of 10^-14 to 1 second. A vacuum-gap cavity and microfabricated mirrors were used to hold the lasers together. Continuation of this laser construction has implications for further development in technology including portable optical clocks, radio frequency photonic oscillators and communication and navigation systems that require hertz linewidths for operation.† Hunters are Hot Hunting is an important source of provision for small-scale societies. While it is important for the survival of the communities dependent on it, hunting also provides reward for the hunter in terms of social status and attractiveness amongst the community. UCSB researcher Benjamin C. Trumble from the Department of Anthropology worked with researchers from Arizona State University to shed light on the extent of the correlation between success in hunting to the hunter's appeal and desirability for the rest of the community. They conducted a study taking 52 individuals from the Ach√© hunter-gatherer tribe of Paraguay, and administering ranking- and choice-tasks to them. The rating was based on provisioning and fighting ability, disease resistance and appeal as a mate. The results reveal that, overall, hunters are admired and perceived with great admiration. When analyzing the success rates and what kind of prey the hunters would kill, there are differing outcomes. While there is a positive correlation between desirability and killing prey that is both elusive and difficult to capture, there is less appeal for individuals who would kill a single large animal in relation to a larger quantity of smaller animals that equates to the same biomass makeup. Generally, a greater consistency is seen as more attractive. Nevertheless, all hunters are shown to be viewed as having better phenotypes and status amongst the rest of the population.† Food Footprints A great portion of the global environmental footprint stems from food production. The pressures that result from the pollution affect marine, freshwater and terrestrial systems. While environmental impact has garnered much attention, there is little that researchers know about the disproportionate effects of climate change from food production on specific habitats. Researchers Benjamin S. Halpern, Melanie Frazier, Juliette Verstaen, Paul-Eric Rayner, Gage Clawson, Richard S. Cottrell and Caitlin D. Kuempel from UCSB's National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, as well as Halley E. Froehlich from UCSB's Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology have conducted a study on the geospatial analysis of the greenhouse gasses stemming from the food industry. The results reveal that the footprint of food is split between land and marine systems, where five countries alone are responsible for half of the cumulative food footprint. The industry of marine food sources produce only 1.1% of the global supply, yet contributes to 9% of the pollution globally. Continuation of this study promises a better understanding of what sources have disproportionate impacts on the environmental global footprint and allows for prioritizing the attention toward food that is more sustainable that can more effectively feed the global population whilst aiding the environment.††

science,Psychological & brain sciences department assesses predictors of blame for gay men in homicide cases,19-Jan-23,9:00 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-19/psychological-brain-sciences-department-assesses-predictors-of-blame-for-gay-men-in-homicide-cases/,"Warning: This article discusses sexual identity and violence.† † Elizabeth Quinn-Jensen, a graduate student and researcher in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, and her colleagues ""î Allison Skinner-Dorkenoo from the University of Georgia and James Wages from Northwestern University ""î recently published a paper exploring how strong feelings of disgust toward gay males may predict increased blame in homicide cases, particularly in the United States.† Quinn-Jensen said that her interest in the subject and the idea for the research study came about while she was a senior in undergraduate studies at Northwestern University and learned that there was a tendency for gay men to be disproportionately blamed for crimes committed against them.† ""There was this whole legal defense, the ""ògay panic defense,' which isn't legal in all states now ""¶ but it is in some, in which basically a defendant can claim that they were so overcome by emotion when another male hit on them, either in a romantic or a social sense, that they became so overwhelmed that they lost control,""ù Quinn-Jensen said.† Upon her discovery of this, Quinn-Jensen conducted additional research on the topic. Previous evidence showed that people tend to have feelings of disgust toward gay men, which can manifest in increased levels of prejudice and violence. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, almost ten percent of the hate crimes reported in 2017 were directed toward gay men.
 ""I wondered if it was possible that these feelings of disgust [toward gay men] ""¶ could potentially be why [people] are more likely to blame gay men when there is a crime committed against them,""ù Quinn-Jensen said.† The paper, initially published in January 2021 and comprising two studies, looked at two different types of disgust. The first study revealed peoples' implicit biases and feelings of disgust specifically toward gay men; the second discussed unconscious associations between disgusting images and gay versus straight men, as well as general feelings of disgust unrelated to gay men, and whether these feelings could also increase likelihoods of victim blaming.† In the first study, participants ""î heterosexual men and women ""î completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT), which involved pairing images of disgust with images of heterosexual and homosexual couples. Participants then read a case scenario modeled on a real defense. In the scenario, a friendly conversation at a bar occurred between two males, where the victim made a romantic pass at the defendant, resulting in the defendant beating the victim to death. Participants were also asked how likely they were to think that this was a hate crime, meaning that the defendant was motivated by his hatred for gay men. One of the images used for the IAT to denote gay male couples. These images were then either shown with words denoting disgust (e.g., gross, nasty, nauseating) and pleasure (e.g., appealing, satisfying, delightful.) (Courtesy of Elizabeth Quinn-Jensen) ""We found in the first study that the more people had these associations between gay men and disgust, the more likely they were to blame the victim and the less likely they were to say that it was a hate crime,""ù said Quinn-Jensen.† In the second study, participants looked at unrelated images meant to elicit disgust, such as that of a dirty toilet, while other participants in a controlled setting looked at images of non-disgust eliciting objects, such as paper and staplers. The participants then took the same IAT, completed a measure of victim blame and answered whether they thought the gay man was the victim of a hate crime.† Quinn-Jensen and her colleagues found that participants who had been exposed to more disgust-eliciting images, regardless of their relation to gay men, were more likely to victim blame and less likely to apply the hate-crime statute. Additionally, the study showed that participants that were exposed to generally disgusting images (i.e. the dirty toilet) were also then more disgusted by gay men and more likely to blame them as the victim. One of the images used for the IAT to denote gay male couples. (Courtesy of Elizabeth Quinn-Jensen) Although her research focused on homicide cases, Quinn-Jensen said that peoples' implicit stereotypes and unconscious biases can still to some extent play a role in their attitudes towards victims of any crime.† ""Human beings aren't totally irrational,""ù she said. ""If a gay man [gets] mugged, for example ""¶ I don't think even people who have these implicit disgust associations would be like, ""òWell, they shouldn't [have been] walking around with their wallet.'""ù Nevertheless, the study did find that peoples' emotions have real world implications for defendants and victims. Regarding whether these unconscious biases may leak into the legal system, Quinn-Jensen said that while it is hard to tell in many cases due to those involved not being aware of or wanting to admit to being influenced by their emotions, there is lots of research saying that emotions in general, even unconscious ones, do influence judgements and legal decision-making.† For example, Quinn-Jensen referenced a past study which showed that if jurors and/or the judge are exposed to more disgusting stimuli, they are more predisposed to give the defendant a harsher sentence. It should be noted, however, that Quinn-Jensen and the other authors are not necessarily advocating for the removal of all disgust-eliciting media from courtrooms.† ""It's not possible to eliminate all disgust elicitors in a courtroom,""ù Quinn-Jensen said. ""I think they're important for evidentiary purposes, but I think there are also things that we can do to counteract the emotional effects they have on jury decision-making.""ù Homosexual men, specifically, have borne the brunt of public disdain for centuries, despite the many breakthroughs in gay rights over the last few decades. Quinn-Jensen said that there are many factors that can affect our implicit biases and beliefs. Moral or religious opinions often play a large role but, interestingly, so can our biological instincts regarding perceived danger of disease, sometimes leading to disgust reactions.† In fact, similar to what the team's study found, this country has seen feelings of disgust towards and subsequent dehumanization of gay men before, with the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. The stigma still stands even now: some people still think homosexual relationships are morally wrong, while others may still be responding to that initial fear of disease. Quinn-Jensen said that more strong prejudices are typically seen when looking at heterosexual men endorsing strong masculinity norms.† Additionally, in the wake of the ""Me Too""ù movement, as well as with the increasing popularization of ""cancel culture,""ù the concept of ""victim blaming""ù has appeared frequently in recent news. Asked about a possible double standard for women and men, or even heterosexual and homosexual victims regarding victim blaming, Quinn-Jensen acknowledged that people belonging to stigmatized groups ""î like gay men, sex workers or houseless people ""î are generally blamed more in cases of violent crimes.† ""There is no ""òstraight panic defense,'""ù Quinn-Jensen said.† Because of the stigma around homosexuality, she argues that people are more willing to take the gay panic defense as reasonable than they might be for a similar argument from a woman or gay man.† ""Human beings like to use emotion as information, and we sometimes treat it like unbiased information,""ù she added.† ""While it's good to have our emotional reactions, and sometimes they may be valid ""¶ we can't always trust these emotions as ""òimportant information' about what's going on.""ù Quinn-Jensen hopes that, after reading the paper, people will be more aware of their own implicit biases and how things in their environment can affect their emotions, which can in turn affect their decisions, with potentially real world, legal implications. While making important decisions and judgements, especially about stigmatized groups, Quinn-Jensen urges readers to be aware of how their emotions are affecting them.† ""Everyone has implicit biases, but [with increased awareness] you can correct for them.""ù † Liz Quinn-Jensen recommends those interested in learning more about the topics of implicit bias, disgust responses and their connections to violence against gay men, and/or the role of emotion in the court-room, to check out these additional papers:

science,Simply Stated: Where‚'d All The Eggs Go?,19-Jan-23,9:00 AM,['Anaya Khan'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-19/108892/,"BLAKE ALLEN / DAILY NEXUS With students returning to campus to jumpstart Winter Quarter 2023, shopping for groceries is on everyone's mind. While it is expected for some supplies to be temporarily in high demand and difficult to obtain during this time, eggs are especially low in stock and uncharacteristically expensive. Where one may have to sacrifice their favorite brand of butter for an alternative, they would find that there is an even more limited option for eggs. Where the limited supply is restocked, the prices are incredibly high in relation to the past. The empty shelves and high prices have affected markets across not only California, but the entire country. The culprit of the situation is a pathogenic outbreak of avian influenza, or bird flu, that has been plaguing the poultry populations for the past year.† Outbreaks of avian influenza are not uncommon. The last major case occurred in 2015, lasting from Dec. 11, 2014 to Jan. 16, 2015, according to reports recorded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).† ""Approximately 7.4 million turkeys and 43 million egg-layers/pullet chickens, as well as a limited number of mixed poultry flocks, were affected by HPAI and died from the disease or were depopulated as part of the response,""ù according to USDA's ""Final Report for the 2014-2015 Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in the United States.""ù ""This outbreak was the largest HPAI outbreak ever recorded in the United States and arguably the most significant animal health event in U.S. history.""ù While the 2014-15 outbreak had devastating impacts on poultry and wild bird populations, the disease was contained within a few months of the first report. The current case continues to persist and lasted throughout the majority of 2022 since its primary detection in February of that year. According to USDA's reporting, which was last updated on Jan. 17, 2023,† a confirmed count of 781,416 birds were affected in California alone, and 57.86 million across 47 of the 50 states. With such a rapid depopulation of birds that grocers and individuals rely on for a supply of eggs, their price rates have risen steadily. According to the USDA, ""The depopulations at commercial facilities have decreased the domestic egg supply by about 7.5 percent on average each month since the outbreak began.""ù Urner Barry, one of the leading reporters of food market data, shows that the benchmark for eggs prices hit nearly $5 in December of 2022, while the equivalent carton was less than $2 the previous year. The rapid decrease of the egg prices in January can be attributed to the especially high demand during the end of the year, when people spend more of their free time cooking and baking during the holidays.† Avian influenza is not the only factor that has majorly impacted the current state of egg supply. Other sources include the increase in costs of fuel, feed and packaging, as well as steadily high demand, according to a KCRA3 report on Dec. 29, 2022. The holiday demand has put an additional stress on the wholesale prices. Although year-round demand is strong, ""as that peak holiday demand passes, wholesale prices are expected to fall.""ù Despite this slight expected victory, people continue to search for the popular grocery item to little avail.† With the rapidly decreasing supply and the generally consistent year-round demand for eggs, it is expected that the situation will get slightly worse before it gets better. The outbreak is projected to continue plaguing the flocks well into this year, according to Brian Earnest, CoBank's lead economist for animal protein. ""We're going to see a tight supply situation and elevated pricing environment moving forward,""ù he stated. Should the disease ease and supply increase, it would still take time to return back to past retail prices.†

science,"‚""Implicit Bias in Healthcare:‚""ù A Webinar hosted by the Health Professions Association",26-Jan-23,9:00 AM,['Meenakshi Manoj'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-26/implicit-bias-in-healthcare-a-webinar-hosted-by-the-health-professions-association/,"UC Santa Barbara's Health Professions Association's Inclusivity & Outreach Committee, in collaboration with the African diasporic Cultural Resource Center and Los Curanderos, hosted a webinar to highlight implicit, unconscious and structural bias in healthcare, on Jan. 21. Terrell Winder, an assistant professor of sociology at UCSB, shed light on the historical and contemporary types and effects of institutional biases and interpersonal biases in healthcare. He discussed the underlying impact of patient interactions and healthcare settings in the context of medical mistrust, malpractice, stereotyping and pathologizing based on patient gender, ethnicity and race.† ""African American and American Indian/Alaska Native females have higher rates of stroke-related death,""ù Winder said. ""African American men are twice as likely as whites to die prematurely from stroke.""ù Winder also shared that professionals should ""[avoid] stigmatizing responses to patients [by] maintaining non-judgmental body language and [checking] your verbal tone and assumptions about patient behaviors, and [you] have to detach your own personal beliefs from the behaviors or the things that people are sharing with you ""¶ your expectations of your clients can influence a diagnosis[.]""ù† ""[P]atients are only going to be as honest with you as they feel they can be in order to get what they need""¶ patients will withhold information from perceived judgment,""ù Winder said. Associate professor of Clinical Medicine and the Gold-Headed Cane Endowed Teaching Chair in Internal Medicine at UC San Francisco Dr. Denise M. Connor expanded on implicit bias in healthcare diagnoses. Connor's presentation focused on the significance of diagnosis when surfacing errors in medicine. She referenced the books ""To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System""ù by the Institute of Public Health, ""Improving Diagnosis in Health Care""ù by the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, and ""Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care""ù by the Institute of Medicine in her introduction to disparities in medical treatment, listed in the graphic.† Connor outlined the disparities in medical diagnoses, referencing the delayed diagnosis of appendicitis in Black children, delayed dementia diagnosis in Asian and Hispanic/Latinx individuals, and missed diagnoses in simulated cases of chest pain for heart attack and cancer in Black and Latinx patients.† Delayed and inaccurate medical diagnoses are an underestimated form of error in medicine, according to Connor.† ""Diagnostic error is actually very hard to measure,""ù Connor said. ""So it's probably underestimated. It's often the case that someone gets a missed diagnosis or inappropriate diagnosis, and [the] mistake may never come to light.""ù Disparities in sustaining healthcare and providing accurate diagnosis may also be due to unconscious biases.† ""[I]mplicit bias is triggered in certain settings ""¶ when you're busy, when you have competing responsibilities, when you're multitasking, when you're under a lot of pressure, when you have less personal experience with a group or a person ""¶ and this describes clinical medicine,""ù Connor said. Connor said her analysis of disparities in medical diagnoses concluded that medical professionals have to understand when to use pattern recognition and analytic thinking when diagnosing a patient.† Pattern recognition is when signs and symptoms are compared to previous cases, Connor explained, while analytical thinking is when signs and symptoms are evaluated by conducting certain tests and procedures for a clear-cut analysis.† According to Connor, mistakes can be made if a medical professional consults solely on pattern recognition or solely analytic thinking. The second half of the webinar consisted of three selected individuals with experience in medicine and/or healthcare who participated as Q&A panelists to share their insights on implicit bias in healthcare: Nkiruka Chuba, an assistant clinical professor in the OB/GYN Generalist Division at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at UC Irvine; Ebenezer Larnyo, a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Black Studies Research at UCSB; Javier Guerrero, a medical student at UC Davis School of Medicine; and member of the Rural-PRIME program.† Kareena Johnson, the co-host of the webinar and a fourth-year biological sciences student at UCSB, posed a question asking how implicit bias related to the panelists' personal experiences in healthcare.† ""I see a lot of patients for chronic pelvic pain,""ù Chuba said. ""There can be all kinds of reasons why somebody comes into the emergency room ""¶ do we treat certain people differently regarding their pain management because we think that they are stronger, or do we give a lot of pain medication to other patients because we implicitly think they are weaker?""ù As Chuba described her experience with implicit bias in a hospital setting, Guerrerro shared his experience as a medical student working at a student-run clinic. ""For myself as a medical student, [I] see [implicit bias] creep up in small ways. I""¶ was surprised to find out that some [patients] already had Medi-Cal, but yet they're coming to our free student-run clinic because they felt like they're really understood there. [A lot] of us spoke Spanish and had the same cultural background,""ù Guerrerro said.† The webinar set forth how implicit bias should be acknowledged and avoided in a healthcare setting. Johnson concluded the session by echoing a quote by James Baldwin used in Winder's earlier presentation: ""Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.""ù

The authors particularly emphasized transdisciplinarity among computer and environmental scientists, and experts in academia, policy and government to pool their resources and knowledge to accelerate and improve the collection of data on a rapidly warming and evolving global climate.† Bettering Biotechnology Diva Amon, a marine biologist who serves as a scientific advisor to UCSB's Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory, recently published a report in Nature exhorting academics in the field of marine biotechnology to help direct the discipline in a direction pursuant of ""principles of sustainability, equity and inclusivity.""ù Amon and her collaborators, including first author Robert Blasiak of the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University, attribute the degradation of global ocean systems to the leaders of marine biotechnology, who belong to industrialized countries and corporate institutions. A paper also authored by Blasiak found that 98% of filed patents in marine biotechnology come from just 10 countries.† The issue of profit and productivity being foremost to the drivers of marine biotechnology has derailed the field from what the authors refer to as ""blue economy principles of equity and inclusivity,""ù as technology develops faster than regulation for that technology can be enacted.† The paper discusses potential solutions to guide the marine biotechnology industry toward a more ethical attempt to more consciously consider nature and sustainability. Some solutions included improving aquaculture production to counteract overfishing and overuse of products and resources that Indigenous peoples depend upon for subsistence. Blasiak, Amon and the other collaborators of the paper recommended that marine biotechnology leaders work to support conservation efforts and use existing technology and research to devise solutions to sustainability threats to the marine biome.† Modern Love Though psychologists understand that there exists a biological basis to love, what remains unstudied is how culture and environment impact a person's approach to love. The study was led by Piotr Sorokowski ""î an academic researcher from the University of Wroc≈Çaw's Institute of Psychology ""î alongside professor Daniel Conroy-Beam from UCSB's psychological & brain sciences department.† The paper explored the possibility of whether a country's level of modernization is related to the quality of love experiences of 9,474 individuals from 45 countries. The level of love was measured according to the ""Triangular Love Scale,""ù which considers the level of passion, intimacy and commitment in a relationship. Factors for country-level predictors that were used for the study were a country's level of modernization, individualism-collectivism ratio and average annual temperatures.† This study, which its authors say to be ""one of the largest studies on cross-cultural differences in love experiences to date,""ù shows that love is not only universally experienced but variably experienced depending on a country's level of modernization and centralization of capitalistic values. This study was also the first to provide empirical evidence on how varying levels of human development and modernization impact experiences of love and marriage. Countries with higher levels of modernization containing more gender-equal cultures felt and channeled more love toward their partners, particularly when it came to intimacy ""î but to a point. There came a threshold where considerably higher levels of modernization didn't equate to higher levels of love.† Also included in the results was evidence that the level of collectivism underlying a country's culture correlated with higher levels of intimacy and commitment in romantic relationships. The authors reasoned that perhaps individuals from collectivist cultures ""might be more altruistic towards their partners,""ù leading to more closeness and intimacy in the relationship.

Some familiar programs are Photomath, Quizlet and Socratic, which are designed to help students with troublesome work problems and to assist with studying for the next big exam. Although the creators may have had good intentions while creating these programs, they can easily be viewed as a great threat to academic honesty. Technology is quickly becoming more present in today's education system; a great shift is seen as many grading systems transition to the all-powerful Canvas ""î a program where you can communicate with anyone in school, view grades, take exams, carry out homework and plan your schedule. A big question that teachers and administrators ask is, ""How can we stop students from cheating?""ù A remotely assigned exam can be taken with the assistance of our phones that never leave the palm of our hands. Another approach is hopping on a FaceTime call, making a solo test a group effort. In addition, there are tablet devices, physical notes and new Google tabs that are ready to assist when in need of help. As we become more dependent on technology, a new artificial intelligence (AI) system has attracted great attention. It goes by the name of ChatGPT.† So what even is ChatGPT? It stands for Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. According to Techopedia, this complex program works on machine learning algorithms, which are designed to recognize patterns and rules. Techopedia explains how learning algorithms produce learning models that can be applied on data and generate predictions. Techopedia reports that ChatGPT has been trained on a great amount of data from the internet before the year 2022, and with this source of information, the program is able to carry out natural language generation (NGL) tasks with high accuracy. NLG tasks are a subcategory of artificial intelligence and uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data and summarize it in a way that seems like a human wrote it. As a conversational chatbot, the goal is to simulate a human conversation. What is so unique about this program is its power to quickly produce customized essays, resumes, solutions to math problems and general answers to anything one pleases to ask or order. Any time you have a question or a command, ChatGPT can supply a result in the most efficient manner.† What are the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT? According to writer Maxwell Timothy at MakeUseOf, this program can provide creative, original jokes, songs and stories. Along with its creative abilities, it can answer complex questions dealing with topics such as dark matter, and it can even help frustrated students with tricky math problems. A skeptic would expect simple one-lined answers, but ChatGPT goes to impress the public by being able to write full-length essays within seconds. Although the program is highly capable, there are limitations to its ability. According to OpenAI (a non-profit artificial intelligence research organization that was co-founded by Elon Musk in 2015), ChatGPT has been found to ""write plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers ""¶ The model is often excessively verbose and overuses certain phrases.""ù The program is constantly modified in order to improve performance. One critical issue that OpenAI discusses is when the chatbot responds to inappropriate questions. In response to these questions, the AI trainers work to make the model refuse such requests, but ""it will sometimes respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior.""ù ChatGPT has its flaws, but it is also a revolutionary creation in terms of past chatbot AI.† What does this mean for students applying to college, taking exams, writing essays and carrying out graded assignments in general? In New York City, the education department has banned ChatGPT from all devices and networks in its public schools. A department spokesman, Jenna Lyle, said the ban was based on ""concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of contents.""ù Another issue that arises is that ChatGPT can encourage students to plagiarize and, thus, inhibit the process of learning and growing critical thinking skills. On the other hand, ChatGPT gives opportunities to learn more about artificial intelligence and this new era of complex technology. Teachers and administrators are trying to find ways to work with ChatGPT without compromising a student's education. Dan Lewer, an educator, proposed a solution of requiring students to submit videos verbally explaining their essays in order to verify authenticity and to grow communication skills. The education system is trying to figure out how to live with ChatGPT, and that can possibly result in more changes in how we learn and write. What should we do? ChatGPT is foreign waters. There is a possibility for more school systems to regulate or even ban the use of the program. ChatGPT is entertaining to interact with and makes one even more curious about its capabilities. The program can help us brainstorm whenever we feel stuck in the creative department, but it can easily become very dangerous when we plagiarize and claim the work produced by a computer as our own. With how realistic the results are to human-made products, the differentiation of authentic human thoughts and ChatGPT becomes more questionable and blurry.

Print As AI technology continues to progress, the future of chatbots holds immense potential, including the ability to create landing pages https://paulsmarketingvault.blog/ seamlessly. With the advancements in AI ChatGPT4, we can expect even more human-like conversations and a seamless integration of chatbots into our everyday lives. From customer support to personal assistants, AI chatbots powered by GPT-4 have the potential to enhance productivity, efficiency, and overall user experience.

science,Addressing the Groundwater Problem in one of the World‚'s Largest Crop producers,2-Feb-23,9:00 AM,['Meenakshi Manoj'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-02/addressing-the-groundwater-problem-in-one-of-the-worlds-largest-crop-producers/,"An assistant professor in the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan Meha Jain presented her research on ways to sustainably increase agricultural production, specifically in India† on Jan. 23 at Bren Hall.† Jain proposed remote sensing and geospatial analyses and census datasets as important methods of examining farmer decision-making across India in order to draw conclusions about the relationship between climate change, groundwater depletion and agricultural production. Remote sensing is done by using satellite technology to scan crop areas for different factors such as crop area and groundwater levels. The gathered data, along with satellite photography, and historical data is processed through imagery algorithms to conduct what is known as a geospatial analysis. The census datasets Jain and her team used consist of 20,000 test wells across India. ""You have extreme [groundwater] depletion in [North India], and also South India""¶ [India] is expected to face some of the largest impacts from warming temperatures over the coming decade,""ù Jain said. Jain poses three research questions for which she provides hypotheses, quantified evidence and conclusions throughout her presentation: ""What are the impacts of groundwater depletion on agricultural production?""ù; ""Are there adaptation strategies that can reduce the negative impacts of groundwater depletion on agricultural production?""ù; and ""What are the feedbacks between climate change, groundwater depletion, and agricultural production?""ù To identify the extent to which groundwater depletion impacts agricultural production in India, Jain and her team used data on groundwater depth from 20,000 test wells across India. Data was aggregated from 2004-13. Jain analyzed whether farmers can adapt to depleting groundwater levels by planting crops requiring less water, such as maize, than more water-intensive crops like rice. She does this by looking at whether the proportion of area planted under each crop changes per every one meter fall in groundwater depth. ""Farmers aren't really switching crops as a way to adapt to falling water tables ""¶ you see it a little bit in the monsoon season with rice, but not so much,""ù Jain said. ""Groundwater depletion is associated with small yield reductions and moderate production losses for most winter crops ""¶ Even historical levels of groundwater depletion have caused crop production to decrease.""ù† With regard to Jain's second research focus, her team explored how effectively canal irrigation systems may substitute groundwater usage in depleted areas of India. Gridded rainfall data was used to account for weather as a control in the analysis of groundwater depletion and agricultural production. Agricultural production was tracked using remote sensing measurements of winter crop areas. Groundwater depletion was measured by compiling village-level irrigation source data (a sample size of 600,000) and projections of groundwater stress. ""We used MODIS satellite data [to identify] which pixels were growing a crop or not growing a crop based on looking at vegetation phenologies [and a specific algorithm that accounted for heterogeneity],""ù Jain said. MODIS is short for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Jain and her team ran cross-sectional regressions with district fixed effects to determine the effectiveness of groundwater versus canal irrigation on winter cropped areas. Factors such as soil type and average household assets at the village level were accounted for. ""Tube wells""ù and ""dug wells""ù are two forms of pulling groundwater that farmers use for winter crops. Dug wells are known to pull water from shallower depths of around 8 meters and above while tube wells are more intensive and effective, and can pull groundwater from much deeper levels.† Tube wells and canal irrigation were compared, and it was concluded that canal irrigation is associated with lower crop areas and is a less reliable irrigation method when compared to dug well irrigated crop areas in the long run. ""[Canal irrigation] does really well when it rains a lot [but] groundwater villages are more stable with the amount of production they have,""ù Jain said. When the data was analyzed state-by-state, tube well irrigation outperforms canals, particularly across North India. On the other hand, canal irrigation did better than or as well as groundwater irrigation in South India.† Using data sets provided by the Indian government, Jain and her team analyzed the blocks smaller than the district-level that were categorized as overexploited or safe based on groundwater depth data.† ""If all groundwater is lost from over-exploited regions, India could lose up to 20% of winter cropped area ""¶ as an upper-bound estimate,""ù Jain said. The main losses are found in the North and West regions of India where most of the winter crop productions are concentrated. This area is known as the Indo-Gangetic Plains, ""the equivalent of the midwestern Bread Basket,""ù Jain said. The focus of Jain's last research paper is the effect of climate change on agricultural production. ""With increasing temperatures, we expect that crop water stress would likely increase and this is because it would mean that potential evapotranspiration [would increase],""ù Jain said. ""One way that farmers might be able to offset this increased crop water stress is to increase the amount of irrigation that they're using [which would] likely [lead] to further groundwater declines.""ù† This hypothesis was confirmed using panel fixed effects regressions and year fixed effects, where the change in groundwater levels is the dependent variable and the mean temperature is the independent variable. Potential differences in agricultural or vegetational productivity through time were controlled using the satellite-measure Leaf area index. According to Copernicus Global Land Service, ""the Leaf Area Index is defined as half the total area of green elements of the canopy per unit horizontal ground area.""ù† According to Jain, using projectional estimates until 2050, ""we see that groundwater depletion rates could quadruple compared to current rates [of around 5 centimeters per year].""ù Some sensitivity analyses were conducted to see how the results would change, but the overall large magnitude of changing net groundwater levels remains. Jain's take home message is that groundwater depletion is a rising issue, exacerbated by warming temperatures, that is affecting India's current crop yield and cannot be fully replaced with canal irrigation. † .

The snails ""î many of which remain onshore ""î washed up due to powerful storm surges and high tides resulting from waves over 10 feet. In the comments of Instagram and Facebook posts sharing the peculiar scene, users suggested that visitors of Coal Oil Point Reserve toss shells back into the water. But what do the experts advise? Hanna Weyland, a western snowy plover specialist at Coal Oil Point Reserve, spoke on the topic. ""It's complicated,""ù she said. ""We try not to encourage people to touch protected resources.""ù Even empty shells, she emphasized, are valuable. ""Just because they're unoccupied, it doesn't mean they won't be occupied in the future. They can [be] great homes for other creatures.""ù Coal Oil Point Reserve is a part of the Campus Point State Marine Conservation Area, all of which is a no-take zone. This means that it is prohibited by law for visitors to touch or take any living, geological or cultural resource within its 10.56 square mile boundary, an area that stretches from Campus Point to Ellwood Forest Park and several miles into the water.† Because scientists aim to both restore and conserve the habitats and species living within them, it's essential that we minimize human disturbances. It is critical that visitors approach Coal Oil Point Reserve and the greater Campus Point State Marine Conservation Area with utmost respect.† ""We are coming into these organisms' homes, not the other way around,""ù Weyland said.† The beauty of the protected land is housed in its tremendous diversity of wildlife ""There's so many habitats that occur on this particular stretch of land. The area is home to numerous coastal-strand, shorebird, coastal scrub mix, marine and intertidal species,""ù Weyland said.† It's also home to the western snowy plover, a federally threatened species of shorebird. Coal Oil Point Reserve has participated in efforts to conserve and protect the western snowy plover. From March to September, visitors of Coal Oil Point Reserve should be extra cautious of tiny hatched plover chicks scurrying on the beach. Barely the size of a cotton ball, the birds require extra attention to survive to adulthood.† Daira Chavez-Hernandez, a student intern at Coal Oil Point Reserve, spoke on the precautions people should exercise. ""Pick up any trash on the beach ""¶ like sunscreen bottles. Trash can attract predators like skunks and seagulls that prey on the threatened snowy plover.""ù Sharp glass that hasn't yet been eroded should be picked up, too. Chavez-Hernandez added, ""Be mindful of ""¶ plants, signs [and] areas that are roped off.""ù These are specially designed to protect sensitive species found on the reserve. Weyland emphasized a crucial principle to follow: Leash your dogs!† ""The reserve [is a] part of UCSB, and it's right in front of the plover habitat. All we're asking for is if you can keep your dogs on a leash for a seven-minute walk, or an 800-meter stretch of land.""ù To further protect marine life, here are some additional rules to keep in mind: † The guiding principle, according to Weyland, should be to limit all disturbances.†† As Weyland put it, ""it is a privilege to have an accessible environment as beautiful as the [Campus Marine Protected areas] in our backyards.""ù Indeed, it is our duty, as habitants of Isla Vista and students at UCSB, to protect the natural beauty that thrived here long before us.† Be sure to follow @coaloilpointreserve on Instagram for research and marine life highlights, and keep an eye out for plover chicks from March to September! † Comments are closed.

science,Simply Stated: Could a zombie apocalypse actually happen in real life?,9-Feb-23,10:00 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-09/simply-stated-could-a-zombie-apocalypse-actually-happen-in-real-life/,"MICHELLE WU / DAILY NEXUS Zombie apocalypses have been portrayed countless times in movies, shows and video games such as ""The Walking Dead""ù and ""The Last of Us,""ù the latter of which was recently adapted into an HBO television series. Fans of ""The Last of Us""ù might be wondering if a zombie apocalypse could ever actually happen in real life. As it turns out, the creators of the 2013 post-apocalyptic video game drew inspiration from a real-life fungus that infects ants and other insects called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis. The parasitic fungus thrives in tropical areas and produces zombified ants, using them as a vessel to infect new victims. The unsettling method in which Ophiocordyceps unilateralis takes over an ant's body involves an infection through which the fungus' spores infiltrate the ant's exoskeleton. The fungus then grows around the ant's brain, which allows it to gain control of the nervous system. According to Ian Will, a fungal geneticist at the University of Central Florida, ""It's unclear exactly how it does this, whether by releasing a chemical or altering a bug's DNA.""ù As a result, the ant begins to behave erratically and is compelled to leave its colony, descending to an area of greater humidity that facilitates the growth of the fungus. Forced to permanently lock its jaw to a leaf, it is here that the ant finally meets its fate. After the ant has been dead for several days and the fungus has fed on the ant's insides, its corpse becomes filled with fungal spores. A stalk emerges from the ant's head, which allows the spores to be released into the air in search of another victim to infect. So, could a parasite like Ophiocordyceps unilateralis ever evolve to infect humans? ""The Last of Us""ù imagines a world in which it could: As a result of high temperatures due to climate change, a parasitic fungus takes over the human population. However, the transition from Ophiocordyceps unilateralis infecting ants to infecting humans would be nearly impossible. The conditions in which the fungus thrives and reproduces are far too specific ""î it even has difficulty infecting different species of ants. Furthermore, our body temperature is much too high for a fungus to survive. Jo√£o Ara√∫jo, an expert on parasitic fungi at the New York Botanical Garden, explains that ""if the fungus really wanted to infect mammals it would require millions of years of genetic changes.""ù† Although this fungus would not be the cause of a zombie apocalypse, could it happen in another way? According to scientists, a zombie apocalypse is not impossible, but it is extremely unlikely. One instance of humans entering a zombie-like state is a result of ""prions,""ù which are abnormal proteins that cause other proteins in the brain to share their misfolded shape. Prions are what cause the brain disease known as kuru, which is transmitted by eating human brains. This was seen in a cannibalistic tribe in New Guinea in the 1950s and '60s. The disease causes an unsteady gait, changes in mood and personality and the inability to speak. However, this is the only example of a human disease akin to zombies that we have seen so far. Even then, it is far different from the typical zombie apocalypse scene that is portrayed in media. As far as an infectious disease that is transmitted by bite and causes violent zombies to rise from the dead, there is no need to worry about a zombie apocalypse happening anytime soon.
Print Very informative! A great read As someone who is passionate about video games and esports, I found this article really interesting. It's fascinating to think that a real-life fungus can infect insects and turn them into ""zombies""ù ""ì something that has been portrayed in many popular movies, shows, and video games.

science,UCSB students unveil original video games at campus showcase,10-Feb-23,11:09 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-10/ucsb-students-unveil-original-video-games-at-campus-showcase/,"On Jan. 25, UC Santa Barbara undergraduate students from the ECE 194M Intro to Video Game Development class had the chance to show off their original video game designs to the public. The students' projects ranged from adventure and action games, to puzzle games, to games aimed particularly at younger children.† The showcase was hosted by the Gaucho Game Lab, UCSB's video game development program. The Gaucho Game Lab enables undergraduate students in the computer science and related majors to take a series of elective classes in which they learn about video game design and work toward creating their own games, eventually releasing them to the public. The Gaucho Game Lab is directed by Dr. Pradeep Sen, a professor in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. Sen discussed the idea behind the Gaucho Game Lab and how it aims to instruct students in all aspects of video game design.† ""The whole idea is to teach students how to design a game and how to develop and integrate it and put it all together,""ù he said. ""These are usually juniors and seniors who have quite a bit of programming experience already, but the idea is to teach them how to take that knowledge and sort of apply it to an actual product like a game, something fun.""ù† One of the student-creators also spoke to this and what the experience was like. Daniel Lohn, a recent UCSB graduate, but who was a fourth-year computer science student when he took the game design class, said that he very much enjoyed Sen's class. ""For the first few weeks, you do homework assignments where you build small game prototypes and propose ideas for your final game,""ù Lohn explained. ""You then have six weeks to turn your idea into a complete game.""ù He added that ""one lesson [he] learned early on is that it's very time consuming to make a game,""ù but that ""it's rewarding to see your ideas come to life.""ù† Still from Lohn's game, Garbage Champion. (Image courtesy of Daniel Lohn) Lohn's creation is called ""Garbage Champion""ù, a game in which the player uses a crane to ""blow up lots of boxes.""ù He said that his classmates made all kinds of different games, though, including business games, maze/escape games, shooter games, strategy games, puzzle games and more.  Most of the games, like Lohn's, were individual and only took six weeks to complete, but other, more complex games were done in groups of four or five students over the span of two quarters.† This was the second annual showcase that the Gaucho Game Lab has done, and they hope to continue doing it in future years. ""We hope to continue [the showcase] and also grow it as people start playing our games and get to know us,""ù Sen said. ""I hope we can create like a following, you know, a community.""ù Lohn said that he enjoyed seeing visitors have fun with his game at the showcase. ""[It] made me feel that the time and effort spent on my game was justified.""ù Sen said that hopefully, the students' games will be posted online within the next few months for the public to play.† † Be sure to check out the Gaucho Game Lab on social media: † Twitter: @GauchoGameLab Facebook: @GauchoGameLab Instagram: @gauchogamelab

science,"Simply Stated: Why do we have ‚""òtypes‚'?",16-Feb-23,10:00 AM,['Samarah Paulino'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-16/simply-stated-why-do-we-have-types/,"MICHELLE WU / DAILY NEXUS Whether it be someone who has a good sense of humor, is responsible or has a ""dad bod,""ù everyone has their own ""type.""ù It's no mystery that people like certain traits and are often attracted to others that have them. But what makes these characteristics something we find appealing? Why do we like emotionally unavailable people? What is it about glasses that's so attractive? There are many factors that contribute to our preferred types, but one of the main reasons behind this phenomenon is that we seek out people who are similar to our parents. Growing up, we often associate our parents with comfort and security. This association is reflected in the types of people we choose to have as partners. We look for the same comfort and security that our parents once gave us and, as a result, causes us to have an attraction to people with similar characteristics as our parents, both physically and personality-wise.† According to a paper by professor A.C. Little at the University of St Andrews, we may also look for partners who have physical traits and personalities similar to our parents because they are traits that our mind associates with relationships and the emotions involved in them. People tend to be attracted to those traits because they want to feel the same emotions that they felt with the main relationship they had as a child ""î most often their parents. We expect that those emotions we had as children are the same emotions we should feel when it comes to every other relationship. Growing up, if you were often told what to do and ordered around, your ""type""ù might include people who are domineering or bossy. If you always got what you wanted, your ""type""ù may include people that are willing to spoil you. Looking for a partner with similar traits as your parents can lead you to being attracted to the negative traits that they may also possess. Psychologist Kalanit Ben-Ari explained in an interview with The Tab how we may try to have a partner with the same negative traits as our parents in hope of receiving what we wish we had from them while growing up. For example, if you had reserved parents, you may tend to look for a similarly reserved partner in hopes of them being affectionate toward you. The purpose of this kind of attraction is, as Ben-Ari states, ""to heal and grow from the past and to live in a mature loving and conscious partnership.""ù Another reason behind having ""types""ù stems from our own personalities. When looking for partners we may also look for people who have personalities that complement our own. Outgoing and assertive people, for example, may be attracted to people who are shy and submissive. The reason for this is not simply because they complement our personality, but also because of how their defenses complement our own. Our defenses have roots in early childhood; we created them as a way to help us cope with traumatic or painful experiences and to prevent them from ever hurting us again. According to Psychology Today, we look for people that will support these defenses. For example, we may be attracted to people who reassure insecurities that were created by our defenses. This is what causes us to be attracted to ""toxic""ù people. Oftentimes, our ""types""ù are reflective of our childhood experiences. Whether they were good experiences or not, we look for a partner that we think will give us that same feeling we had as children, even if it means being attracted to people with personalities or physical qualities that our parents have.

science,Simply Stated: Is the T. rex‚'s closest living relative really the chicken?,23-Feb-23,9:00 AM,['Nathan Villasenor'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-23/simply-stated-is-the-t-rexs-closest-living-relative-really-the-chicken/,"NATHAN VILLASENOR / DAILY NEXUS Tyrannosaurus rex, the superstar of the field of paleontology, is having a bit of a resurgence in the public consciousness lately. Just last year, Jurassic World: Dominion earned a billion dollars, making it the third highest grossing film of 2022. In addition to the success of ""Jurassic World""ù, accolades for series like Adult Swim's animated drama ""Primal""ù and Apple TV's documentary series ""Prehistoric Planet""ù prove the continued chokehold the T. rex has on our collective imaginations. In lieu of this surge in popularity, you may stumble across a popular publication or science-based social media account expounding on how this school bus-sized predator's closest living relative is the chicken. Visualize a tyrannosaur running parallel to a barnyard rooster.† For people who grew up with Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster hit, that bold claim seems almost like libel. However, this widely circulated talking point draws a (hilarious) parallel between the dinosaurs of the distant past and their living heirs. Is this statement an accurate reflection of our modern understanding of the dinosaur family tree?† Is Tyrannosaurus rex's closest living relative our modern chickens? Short answer: Yes! Long answer: Also yes! Our common poultry is the closest thing alive today to the T. rex, but then so are penguins, ostriches, hawks, hummingbirds, parrots and every other bird alive today. The truth is that all birds, as well as a bunch of other bird-like dinosaurs, are equally closely related to T. rex. The distinction may seem like an attempt at splitting hairs, but this delineation over who's related to who is incredibly important to understanding the processes of evolution.† To help resolve the relationships between T. rex and modern fowl, we have to dive into their evolutionary histories (buckle up). Both Tyrannosaurus and Paraves, the clade of dinosaurs that includes birds and things like Velociraptor, are theropods, meaning two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs. This group also includes Hollywood stars like Dilophosaurus and Spinosaurus. These reptiles are all united by the anatomy of their hips, features of their skulls, the fact they all had hollow bones and the likelihood of being covered in some form of feathers (yes, you read that right). Traits like hollow bones and plumages adapted overtime to fit entirely different ways of life as each group separated from one another. While giants like T. rex used the hollow air spaces in their bones as scaffolding to allow for bulkier bodies, ancient birds used them to lighten their loads and take flight. Despite how wildly different these features became, those four main characteristics all hail from an ancestral stock of puny carnivores. By comparing the features found in these animals against one another, the long history of their evolution can be charted like a royal pedigree, all leading back to that first population of bipedal meat-eaters.† With this baseline established, it can safely be said that birds are dinosaurs. Cool! So then what's up with Paraves and tyrannosaurs? They're both sisters. More accurately, sister clades; two groups of living things with a shared ancestry. It's kind of like how you and your cousin who won't shut up about crypto can say you are more closely related to each other than either of you are to some guy on the street. The same principle applies to the populations of dinosaurs that lead to both birds and tyrannosaurs as compared to other giant theropods. Weirdly enough, this means that the family that includes T. rex is more closely related to birds than it is to similar hulking predators like Giganotosaurus. This level of diversity between 40-foot-long predators and whatever a seagull is supposed to be is only limited to one of three main branches of the dinosaur family tree. There were also the ornithischians, whose members include famous figures like Triceratops and Stegosaurus, and the long-necked sauropods, which were the largest things to ever walk on land. These many different forms of life are all unified under one biological grouping, which is kind of insane to think about. The myriad birds wandering around the Arbor right now are closely related to animals that could grow as large as a Boeing jet. All this goes to show how connected life truly is. 
Print My rooster objects to your suggestion that a mere penguin or any other bird is as close to T. Rex as him.  He will gladly rip the flesh from your ankle while humping your Birkenstocks to prove his point.

science,Simply Stated: Is Life a Simulation?,2-Mar-23,10:00 AM,['Roshan Mishra'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-02/simply-stated-is-life-a-simulation/,"Life is dominated by conflict, through dialogues of ethics, belief, socio-economic constructs and more. Still, a rarely deliberated aspect of our existence is the overarching reality of it. Most of us strongly agree that what we touch, see, smell and generally interact with physically composes the real world.† Yet, a series of strange, inexplicable phenomena have begun to accumulate within our world. Whether they be eyewitness accounts, personal experiences or documented phenomena, the idea of our very reality being a computerized simulation has only skyrocketed in recent years. Such sentiments have consolidated as beliefs, insinuating that certain aspects of our world seem identical to what we could identify as an artificial construct. These beliefs have coalesced into what is known as ""Simulation Theory.""ù† As elaborated by tech writer Mike Thomas, ""From the time it entered popular consciousness, many have noted that simulation theory is essentially a modern offshoot of Plato's ""òAllegory of the Cave' story from the Ancient Greek philosopher's book ""òThe Republic,' and Ren√© Descartes's evil demon hypothesis from the French philosopher and scientist's ""òFirst Meditation.' Both contain ruminations on perception and the nature of being ""î subjects that continue to puzzle and provoke.""ù AUDREY KENYON / DAILY NEXUS While not uniform, simulation theory's most popular iteration regards the idea of mankind merely being strands of code in an unknowable, grand computer program which invisibly dictates our lives. Even more curiously, the mastermind behind our artificial existence might not be what humanity has usually identified as ""God.""ù Rather than a wise elder figure or unknowable cosmic entity, our very existence may be determined by a mere teenager. New York University philosophy professor David Chalmers described the higher being responsible for this potential hyper-realistic simulation as a ""programmer in the next universe up,""ù perhaps one we might consider a god of some sort ""î though not necessarily in the traditional sense.† ""[They] may just be a teenager,""ù Chalmers said, ""Hacking on a computer and running five universes in the background ""¶ But it might be someone who is nonetheless omniscient, all-knowing and all-powerful about our world.""ù† The idea that all our storied lives ultimately being the sordid byproduct of a curious teenager's coding seems to induce a sense of existential nihilism. Why even aim to achieve if the summation of your life's work remains the simplistic artifices of coding in another's grand design? As Scientific American's Fouad Khan† writes, the lives we command could merely be pleasure outlets that our unseen master, or masters, utilize for their own audiovisual stimulation.† ""So, there you have it. The simplest explanation for the existence of consciousness is that it is an experience being created, by our bodies, but not for us. We are qualia-generating machines,""ù Khan said. ""Like characters in Grand Theft Auto, we exist to create integrated audiovisual outputs. Also, as with characters in Grand Theft Auto, our product most likely is for the benefit of someone experiencing our lives through us.""ù† Qualia is essentially an umbrella word used to describe how humans physically, mentally and emotionally perceive the world around them. If indeed our experiences are but the byproduct of an incomprehensible machination, it'd be needing to replicate certain qualia, such as taste, smell or emotion.† Whether or not our every living, breathing move is dictated for the benefit of another though, we'll still rest our heads tonight and wake up tomorrow to attend our classes and go to work. We'll still eat, breathe, interact with others and generally perform all the expected necessities of a societally integrated human being. These senses of ours, our sight, smell, touch and how they interact with the world around us, provide a sufficient sense of reality enough to persist.† The implications of such a grand possibility of life being the work of quantum computing and digitization may merely be to nod our heads, shrug and move on. As Scientific American best puts it: ""And yet this absolute powerlessness, this perfect deceit offers us no way out in its reveal. All we can do is come to terms with the reality of the simulation and make of it what we can. Here, on earth. In this life.""ù† That is not what qualia means.

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,9-Mar-23,9:00 AM,['Roshan Mishra'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-09/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-18/,"Why punish cheaters? Cheating. Whether you're playing a game via a ChatGPT prompt or using good old-fashioned scrawls on your arm during crucial exams, cheating is just as natural to school students as sticking gum under tables or bringing food to class. A recent scientific article by Sakura Arai, a corresponding author at Japan's Brain Science Institute at Tamagawa University and researcher at UC Santa Barbara's Center for Evolutionary Psychology, and her colleagues grants an in-depth look at the psychological intricacy of punishing cheaters. Primarily, the article examines two approaches to dealing with rulebreakers: standard heavy-handed punishment and softer, cooperative approaches. The study found that, overall, acting cooperatively rather than harshly with punishment begets more receptiveness from the defector in question. The authors emphasize greatly the relationship between implementing passive cooperation (using incentives) and outright punishment. Exploitation and hostility on the part of students against teachers is significantly lessened when passive cooperation is implemented rather than harsh disciplining. However, outright removal of punishment isn't advisable either. The article summarizes its point by remarking that a balanced understanding works best to forge good relations between authority figures and groups while minimizing possibilities for exploitation or cheating; a union of passive withdrawal of cooperation and standard punishment is required.† A new antibiotic† Modern medicine has evolved a long way from leeches and plague doctors, yet the threat of bacterial infection very much remains. Recently, Douglas M. Heithoff, a scientist at UCSB operating in the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, has, alongside his team, identified a compound displaying broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Through a series of verified experiments, it was discovered that compound COE2-2hexyl did not activate usual microbial bacterial resistance when implemented into the test subjects. Furthermore, the compound proved itself harmless when tested on animal subjects (such as mice), dissuading the concern of toxicity with regard to antibiotics. The paper also explains in detail the advantages of COE2-2hexyl over its contenders, including affordability, a simplistic implementation process and the ability to provide insights into the world of microbial drug resistance against antibiotics, among many other advantages. Heithoff and his team are working to streamline this compound into modern medicine quickly and efficiently. Through consistent research initiatives combined with the constant isolation and utilization of the compound with ethical testing and research, the world may very soon witness an affordable breakthrough in the war against bacterial infection in the form of an antibiotic capable of entirely bypassing retaliation.† Mindfulness and making good choices †Recently, Wei Du and Hongbo Yu, two researchers at Peking University's School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences in Beijing, have begun studying mindfulness and its effect on interpersonal relationships. The study entailed two groups ""î a training and control group ""î gathered together to periodically make moral decisions before and after an eight-week period. The training group underwent mindfulness training to make themselves more aware of the world around them, while the control group did not. After the allotted time, it became clear that the training group made the most morally sound decisions (for example, forsaking financial gain for themselves to avoid inflicting suffering on others) compared to the control group, proving that on some level, mindfulness training can have a positive impact on interpersonal relationships. Also mentioned and confronted within this study is the ""moral slippery slope,""ù a trend seeming to occur naturally over time in which individuals lose their ethical compass or forget their lessons in favor of more selfish goals. As the authors have asserted, mindfulness training is geared toward reducing innate selfishness and influencing crucial cognitive processes in our mind to think for the benefit of others rather than just ourselves. The studies thereby inferred that the best means to counteract the slippery slope of moral decision making is through consistent mindfulness training meant to create or otherwise increase feelings of empathy and consideration. Through these programs, decision making and moral judgment can remain steadfast, as they were in the training group rather than be lost over time or outright ignored.†

science,Europa: A new hope,9-Mar-23,10:00 AM,['Zelinda Strell'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-09/europa-a-new-hope/,"With the establishment of NASA in 1958, the quest for evidence of life beyond Earth shortly ensued with a mission to understand existence within our universe, exceeding what was once unimaginable and purely hypothetical. In recent decades, Mars gained recognition for its notable similarities to Earth, with the hope it possesses the necessary conditions to host life and the possible candidacy for acting as an alternative for humans to inhabit in the foreseeable future. In 1965, the Mariner 4 probe discovered that Mars lacks a magnetic field necessary for shielding life forms from radiation, diminishing optimism for life on the planet. Nonetheless, all hope was not lost as there are three operating rovers on Mars, including NASA's rover, Perseverance, programmed to explore its surface to detect traces of evidence of past and present life on the planet. Although much focus and resources are allocated to studying Mars, there is an underrated extraterrestrial body with great potential for life, often overshadowed by its red counterpart. This said underdog is Europa, the smallest of Jupiter's four Galilean moons, eponymous of a Phoenician princess in Greek mythology. According to Dr. Robert Pappalardo, a Europa Mission Project Scientist, ""We believe Europa has the so-called ingredients for life: water, the right chemistry, and chemical energy. These are the three ingredients we look for to determine whether a world is habitable and this is what we are trying to confirm through the Europa mission.""ù† Observations made through telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, have led scientists to believe Europa contains an ocean, likely containing greater quantities of water than all of Earth's oceans amassed. COURTESY OF NASA ""On Earth, just about everywhere there is water, there is life,""ù Pappalardo stated. ""Because there is likely water on Europa, this proves to be a promising sign. We could find something that is like an oasis ""î a place where there are organic materials and there is evidence of internal heat and liquid water not too far down below the surface.""ù According to Pappalardo, this could be a place we could potentially follow up on to send a lander for future search of life. ""If we were to find plumes (places where liquid water is coming out of the subsurface and escaping to space) in Europa, we would have the opportunity to fly through and extract samples from the subsurface, bringing them to Earth in future missions.""ù This may reveal promising landing areas for future exploratory missions, providing us with insight into methods and landing plans for following explorations. The mission status remains a work in progress, as the Europa Clipper team is operating at full speed, progressively preparing for the projected launch on Oct. 10, 2024. According to NASA, due to the vast distance between Earth and Jupiter (an estimated 630.4 million kilometers), the Europa Clipper will reach its destination within five and a half years from departure, arriving in April 2030.† On Dec. 23, 2022, I viewed the Europa Clipper in person at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California with my own eyes. I watched from a bird's eye view behind the observatory glass display, in awe, as a team of approximately 10 employees worked away tirelessly, laboriously climbing up and down ladders to reach the peak of the 16-foot-tall spacecraft. To ensure the sterilization of the workplace, the spacecraft builders wore bunny suits, comparable to hazmat suits, encasing them from head to toe in polyethylene. One worker in particular drew much attention from fellow visitors, as they questioned how he managed to stand completely still for the extended quarterly hour. To our humbling surprise, he is merely a mannequin, acting as a scale to visualize the proportions of the spacecraft to that of an average human body for moments without active workers present. Each worker, apart from the mannequin they dubbed Bob, paced back and forth throughout the workstation, seldomly standing stagnant as they repetitively positioned and repositioned the blue masking tape while tampering with the wires on the spacecraft. That day, I witnessed an illustrious scene of scientific innovation, as we take momentous leaps forward, striving toward our goal of unearthing something greater than ourselves and surpassing the limits we initially classified as unfeasible. What once was our limit is now our starting line, as we ascend human-made objects through the sky, past the atmosphere, reaching space to explore otherworldly oceans in pursuit of alien discovery. Europa stands as a mysterious symbol of hope of new life beyond what we deem recognizable, with the promises its voluminous body of liquid water holds, awaiting our exploration.†††

science,New UCSB Data Science Program Provides Support for Students Underrepresented in Field,9-Mar-23,10:00 AM,['Hannah Walker'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-09/new-ucsb-data-science-program-provides-support-for-students-underrepresented-in-field/,"As the technology within our society advances, the demand for data scientists continues to grow. With median salaries of around $100,910 per year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and as of May 2021, the field has become one that is extremely attractive and well paid. Although this field is clearly advancing technologically, much growth is necessary in terms of societal advancements. Like all competitive S.T.E.M.-related fields, data science in particular fails to provide underprivileged individuals adequate access and representation into the field. Launched this year, Pacific Alliance for Low-income Inclusion in Statistics and Data Science (PALiISaDS) is working to overcome just that. Spread across 7 different institutions, one of which is UC Santa Barbara, and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the program's goal is to bridge the gap that causes this disparity.† The main issue that PALilSaDS is targeting is that, according to Michael Ludkovski, the program director at UCSB, although jobs within data science are extremely well paid, ""three-quarters of them require a master's or a higher degree. [This means that a lot of] low-income student[s] transferring from a two-year institution often find that [they're] too late [to] jump on the bandwagon [as they] don't have the support""ù necessary to know of the options available to them.† Due to this, a common problem lower-income students encounter is the fact that they are unaware that ""they can get the same skill and education while being paid as a TA instead of paying $50,000 a year""ù to pursue a professional degree, Ludkovski explained. Thus, many students are either unable to take the necessary steps needed or end up enduring extreme financial debt in order to be a successful data scientist. Since PALiISaDS focuses on bridging this gap in knowledge and resources, the program targets low-income third-year and transfer students, providing them with support through workshops, seminars, faculty and peer mentoring, in addition to offering them need-based scholarships and graduate school applications for up to three years.† According to Ludkovski, not only are students given the financial support necessary to pursue a higher education, but they are also given the resources necessary to make pursuing an education more affordable and easier. Ludkovski explained that the alliance's ""target is to have over half""ù of their graduates to decide to pursue a master's degree or Ph.D., as they understand that a lot of their students ""can get a really good job, just coming out of undergrad, and might decide that that's the best route for them[selves].""ù The key principle of this program, however, is to provide data science students with the support that will allow them to make this decision themselves. In addition to providing the necessary support to create an equitable field, other professors at UCSB have also been working to establish programs to help grow the industry in a way that understands the nuance and necessity of equity that comes with data science. In 2020, Sharon Tettegah introduced the Student's Engagement & Enrichment in Data Science (S.E.E.D.S.) program in order to apply diverse perspectives to data science as students pursue their undergraduate degrees. Tettegah, the conceptual architect for the program and current director of the Center for Black Studies Research, proposed S.E.E.D.S. due to her beliefs on data.†† ""Data provides a new lens for viewing the world,""ù Tettegah said. ""The questions of where we choose to turn this lens, who gets to look through this lens, who gets to look through this lens and what new steps society takes based on the information provided by this lens are some of the most important ones we could ask. S.E.E.D.S. is unique in the world in taking this question head on.""ù† Understanding this need for diverse individuals when analyzing data, S.E.E.D.S. was created to provide the necessary support to students with similar beliefs to create adequate change in the field. According to the current co-directors of the program, Tettegah and Timothy Sherwood, the program is described through four pillars: ""mentoring by a researcher, discussion forums, skill development and practice [through software carpentry here at UCSB and other places] and participation in symposia.""ù† The program, which currently consists of around 20 to 25 students, supports ""the students with small group mentoring, a stipend, skill development and exposure to diverse content""ù in addition to providing them with ""a living and learning community here at UCSB.""ù Tettegah and Sherwood said that they hope, whether their students go on to graduate school or go into industry, that they gain ""methodological skills and ethnic studies knowledge ""¶ directly helpful in their careers.""ù Although the field of data science still has a lot of room for improvement ""î whether that be technologically, analytically or equitably ""î UCSB, alongside other campuses across the country, is working toward stimulating the necessary change through supportive programs.† To apply to PALilSaDS: www.paliisads.org/apply To learn more about SEEDS: www.cbsr.ucsb.edu/seeds

science,We get by with a little help from our weak social ties: A UCSB PhD student‚'s insight on recent social portfolio study from Harvard researchers,13-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Olivia Gil de Bernabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-13/a-ucsb-phd-students-insight-on-recent-social-portfolio-study-from-harvard-researchers/,"Fulfilling our innate human need for social belonging while navigating a student body of over 20,000 unique backgrounds poses unique challenges. Besides sheer population size, our fast-paced quarter system periodically puts a stop to classmate relationships that would otherwise deepen with time. For UC Santa Barbara students struggling to make and maintain meaningful connections, a recent study examining the link between social networks and psychological well-being may provide some much-needed comfort.†† †The published study, titled ""Relational diversity in social portfolios predicts well-being,""ù utilizes the foundational social psychology principle that social networks are held up by social ties of varying strengths. In other words, the classmate you only reach out to when you need to be filled in on a missed lecture is a weak tie, while the childhood friend you've long considered family is a strong one. From weak to strong, your many social ties combine to form what is called a ""social portfolio.""ù† Seeking to identify what combinations of social tie strength are most predictive of psychological well-being, researchers at Harvard University analyzed self-reported data from over 50,000 participants. Ultimately, their analyses concluded that diverse social portfolios ""î ones that have a range of tie strengths ""î are most predictive of subjective psychological well-being. Meaning, our weak social ties are equally important to individual psychological well-being as our strong ones. †Delancey Wu, a doctoral student with the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at UCSB who studies how close relationships are maintained, shared her insight into the study and spoke on her own research findings.†† †""Whether it's on a broad social group scale or just a one-on-one person, we need to belong,""ù Wu said. ""We want to feel connected with others, and weak ties are a sign that we are integrated into some sort of social group.""ù †While strong social ties show your belonging through their overt intimacy, weak ones provide a form of hidden support. So spotting that one person every week after your evening lab at DLG may be more than an amusing occurrence; it's a weak social connection that signals belonging.† Filling your day with weak social ties ""î from interacting with the barista who serves your coffee every Tuesday morning, to saying hi to someone passing you on your lagoon walk ""î helps to meaningfully improve your psychological well-being.† †""For people who study how relationships start, weak ties are a really useful starting point. They can serve as bridges between potential other close relationships,""ù Wu said. Weak social ties are only half of the picture when it comes to psychological well-being, though, so how do we go about developing strong ones?†† Using the example of attending a club social for the first time, Wu illustrates the value of starting somewhere, further emphasized by a phenomenon called affective forecasting, which describes how people tend to think of the worst possible outcome before attending a social event, even though it tends to play out better. †""The worst thing that could happen is that you don't get along right away, [but] you [still] have a nice little chat ""¶ But what if you actually find someone who's really cool, and they really jive with you? That's the start of a friendship,""ù Wu said.† †Since the possibility of a blossoming meaningful connection is always there, the payoff to pushing beyond the level of weak social ties is significantly larger than the cost of social discomfort that may come with it. And, in any case, by upholding a weak social tie, a little social discomfort may go a long way. †Intimacy forms the basis of social tie strength. Wu's research into the ways that people of individualistic and collectivistic cultures express emotion in relationships, as well as how they share intimacy, is valuable to understanding where people are coming from as we choose how to show our support in relationships. †""With individualistic cultures, they're very much about expressing how you're feeling,""ù Wu said. ""So, in terms of showing how you're available, it may mean validating who the person is and their identity.""ù †Simply holding the space for emotional expression can be meaningful for someone whose cultural background is individualistic. When it comes to more collectivistic cultures, group harmony often grounds decisions, so there's a greater emphasis on the impact that the self has on others.†† †""Emotional expression is not as common because it may disrupt what's going on in the room ""¶ Someone who's more collectivistic may not be as outwardly expressive in their emotions because it's not as normalized,""ù Wu said. †So when it comes to providing support to someone who comes from a collectivist background, urging them to talk about how they feel when they're visibly upset may not be the most tactful course of action. †""Implicit [social] support is really common in collectivist cultures,""ù Wu said. ""It's where you're demonstrating companionship ""î you're there with someone but not actually talking about what's stressing them out. That may be one way to show support.""ù †As students who are constantly meeting people whose backgrounds differ from our own, being culturally competent is indispensable to nurturing relationships. †What's more interesting is the consideration of the intersectionality of different identities.† Wu said, ""If you're from an individualistic culture and you're a woman, how does that differ from someone who is collectivistic and a woman or collectivistic and a man?""ù † I get paid over $220 per hour working from home with 2 kids at home.

science,Can we slow our biological clocks? Cynthia Kenyon lectures on the molecular components of aging at Corwin Pavilion,13-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Meenakshi Manoj'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-13/can-we-slow-our-biological-clocks-vice-president-of-aging-research-at-calico-life-sciences-lectures-on-the-molecular-components-of-aging-at-corwin-pavilion/,"Cynthia Kenyon, vice president of aging research at Calico Life Sciences and director of University of California, San Francisco's Larry L. Hillblom Center for the Biology of Aging,† presented her research regarding evolutionary and molecular processes that can contribute to longevity of a lifespan on April 6 at the Corwin Pavilion as a part of the ""Aging in America""ù lecture series. 

Kenyon's research on longevity first started by observing the chromosomes or genetic material responsible for patterning the body axis in C. elegans. Kenyon first introduced the concept of regulatory genes by describing genes that can be knocked out in fruit flies and whose previous functions could be restored by inserting these genes from C. elegans into fruit flies. In addition, inserting extra copies of regulatory genes into fruit flies could cause the development of extra eyes, spots, wings, legs, etc.† The rate of aging is established early on in life. In humans, the rate of aging doubles every eight years until around 20 years, at which the rate of aging becomes relatively constant. Kenyon discussed the plasticity of aging by comparing the lifespans of various insects, birds and mammals. For example, a parrot's lifespan is greater than a canary's, and a human's lifespan is greater than a tiger's.† Kenyon referenced American scientist Theodosius Dobzhansky's quote, ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,""ù to emphasize the significance of evolution of organisms in the development of characteristics such as physical appearance and average lifespan. Although many organisms may share common ancestors, they have evolved to have different lifespans. The main question which arose from this finding is where the regulatory genes for aging are located. One experiment that was conducted by Kenyon and her lab removed the reproductive organs of C. elegans by laser ablation of the germ cells""î a treatment used to heat-destroy targeted cells with an MRI-guided laser probe. The mutated C. elegans were found to be physically younger in their movement after 13 days compared to wild-type or normal C. elegans.† Kenyon concluded that a key finding from this experiment was that the mutated worms had a less efficient Daf-2 gene. The Daf-2 gene in C. elegans codes for a hormone receptor that is analogous to insulin and IGF-1 receptors in humans. By making the Daf-2 dependent hormone receptors less efficient, cells have increased expression of Daf-16, which is a cellular component that has been linked to activating genes involved in longevity and oxidative stress responses. Oxidative stress can cause cell and tissue damage in the body.† In other words, Daf-16's activation to repair stress-affected parts in the body slows down the physiological clock of an organism. Specifically, Daf-16 activates a pathway of recycling or repairment systems through autophagy or the engulfing of useless substances as well as better resistance to xenobiotics, such as chemical or environmental pollutants and toxins. These signaling pathways contribute to extending life span. In a wild-type C. elegans, Daf-16 is more active later in its lifespan. Kenyon and her colleagues found that worms have a hidden life extension potential that is triggered by a single base pair mutation. In short, lower levels of insulin and IGF-1 signaling caused by the mutation result in a danger signal which activates a protective cellular response that can extend life. The pathway for potential longevity can be activated by other triggers, such as caloric restriction, mutated or inhibited sensory perception and removing germ cells or the gonads, as mentioned earlier. Although caloric restriction has been shown to increase the lifespan of C. elegans, it is only known that this action provides health benefits in humans. Inhibiting smell or taste in C. elegans increases longevity and involves the Daf-16 transcription factor. Kenyon mentioned that just as there are triggers that cause longevity, there are triggers that can shorten the lifespan. High levels of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS), used in common weed killers, are associated with shortened lifespans in C. elegans because of their ability to damage DNA, proteins and lipids in cells. Paraquat, which is a fast-acting herbicide that becomes deactivated in the soil, can generate ROS. Although high exposure to paraquat is associated with reduced life span, low paraquat exposure is shown to help C. elegans live longer, as it partially activates Daf-16 and other stress-responsive transcription factors. Kenyon continued her presentation with the subject of heterochronic genes that control aging in adults using Daf-16 as well as certain trends related to size and other DNA variations that affect longevity. For example, small dogs have mutated IGF-1 or growth factor genes, and this effect is linked to small dogs being able to live longer than large dogs.† After discussing the evolution and findings related to longevity, Kenyon presented her lab's research on protein aggregation and aging in humans. Protein aggregates are common in older animals and are linked to neurodegeneration and found in the oocytes or ovary cells in female C. elegans.† It was discovered that when a female mates with a male, the age-associated protein aggregates in the oocytes are removed in a span of 30 minutes. The sperm makes a signaling factor that the oocyte senses to cause the degradation of protein aggregate using the cellular garbage disposal site known as the lysosome. In this way, an adult female's cells can be converted into young embryonic cells and ""become immortal,""ù as Kenyon puts it. To study aging in humans, computer modeling systems have been developed to predict age using physiological measurements such as strength, blood pressure, reaction time and hormone concentrations. The U.K. Biobank contains 500,000 people's deeply-phenotyped profiles to map DNA variants and profile what traits vary with age.† Through mapping DNA variants in the genome-wide association study (GWAS), it was concluded that the top gene category that affected biological age was neuronal excitation. Neuronal excitation is related to the speed and plasticity of neuron networks and further research is being conducted to understand how changes in the nervous system can affect aging because the physiological clock can predict biological age.† GWAS concluded that increased and decreased levels of aging were best predicted by the level of education and smoking respectively. Other gender-dependent characteristics related to longevity have been ranked using the frailty index for biological age. For example, blood pressure is a stronger indicator of age in females and air expulsion ability is a stronger indicator of age in males. Related to Kenyon's discussion of longevity, an upcoming lecture in the ""Aging in America Lecture Series""ù called ""Aging Genes and Longevity""ù will be presented by Malene Hansen on May 23 at 4:30pm in Henley Hall, Room 1010.† Mike, excellent work.

science,Local community members express concern over 10 new proposed aquaculture sites off of Southern California coast,17-Apr-23,10:36 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-17/local-community-members-express-concern-over-10-new-proposed-aquaculture-sites-off-of-southern-california-coast/,"Local Santa Barbara community members ""î†including several affiliates of the nonprofit group Don't Cage Our Oceans ""î†delivered 2,500 petition signatures on April 5 to the local National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration office against the 10 newly proposed aquaculture sites in the waters off of Southern California, citing significant risk of harmful environmental impact. The group also called on the Biden administration to rescind the Trump administration's 2020 executive order under which these farms would be built.† These farms would be just some of the potential Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs) to come out of Executive Order 13921, which aims to promote aquaculture in federal waters. The order requires the Secretary of Commerce to, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) official public scoping report, ""identify geographic areas containing locations suitable for commercial aquaculture,""ù which potentially includes ""finfish, shellfish, macroalgae, or multi-species aquaculture.""ù†† Offshore finfish farming occurs in marine waters, often close to coastlines and comprising large-scale pens containing up to tens of thousands of individual fish. However, finfish farms can take on a variety of forms, from small-scale to large-scale, and can be located both close to coasts and in the open ocean. Offshore aquaculture in general has often been cited as one of the most effective tools for combating both global human hunger and biodiversity decline, yet many people still express concern at the potential for disastrous environmental consequences such as chemical pollution and marine mammal entanglement.† Red dots show selected site options (SSOs) off of Southern California coast where Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOAs) may be identified. (Courtesy of NOAA) Southern California was one of the first two regions, along with the Gulf of Mexico, to identify one or more AOAs. The area being considered for these farms, referred to as the Southern California Bight, spans from Point Conception to the United States-Mexico border and includes the Channel Islands. Southern California was chosen as particularly conducive to aquaculture due to its moderate mediterranean climate, which is ideal for the success of native finfish species such as yellowtail.† Don't Cage Our Oceans is a project of the nonprofit organization Recirculating Farms and is one of the groups which brought the petitions to NOAA headquarters. Jake Schwartz, an organizer at Don't Cage Our Oceans, expressed concern regarding the environmental impact of offshore finfish farms in particular.† ""There's no way ""î throughout human history ""î to do [offshore finfish farming] sustainably, without pollution runoff,""ù Schwartz said.†† ""We oppose offshore finfish aquaculture,""ù Schwartz continued. ""There's ways to do finfish [cultivation] on land that's sustainable, and you can also do shellfish offshore that's sustainable, but it's the combination of raising fish like yellowtail and tuna and having to pump antibiotics to keep them alive. That's what makes it just inherently unsustainable.""ù Don't Cage Our Oceans organizer Jake Schwartz (center) accompanied other community members downtown on April 5 to deliver 2,500 petition signatures to local NOAA office. (Courtesy of Jake Schwartz, Don't Cage Our Oceans) According to Schwartz, the key difference between onshore and offshore farming is that offshore farms are not closed systems and that with currents flowing in and out of the pens, all the pollution, specifically from finfish farms, can be washed straight into the open ocean. The pollution Schwartz is referring to is the combination of antibiotics, herbicides and pesticides that farms pump into the pens in order to keep the fish alive and kill marine ectoparasites that feed on the tissue and blood of host fish, also known as sea lice. This combination of chemicals and fish waste has the potential of escaping into open waterways: It creates a toxic ""sludge""ù that then sinks to the bottom of the sea and mixes around in the water, which can lead to harmful algal blooms and other potentially catastrophic impacts to the ecosystem.† Another point of contention regarding the intended offshore finfish farms is the possibility of excluding commercial fishermen from the market.† ""Pollution [from the farms] can actually scare off native fish ""¶ and make it harder for fishermen to catch those fish, harder for them to make a living and harder for them to price them at an affordable price,""ù Schwartz said.† On the other hand, California Regional Aquaculture Coordinator Diane Windham said that other wild fish may actually be attracted inland toward pens full of thriving finfish, which would be beneficial to commercial fishermen.† But according to Schwartz, the amount of fish isn't the issue.† ""Every fisherman I've talked to is like, ""òThat is not the problem ""î we have more than enough fish, [but] we actually need the market to sell it to,'""ù he said.† Windham added that farming native species like yellowtail rather than farming nonnative ones is crucial.† ""[Yellowtail] is a really promising species. It's native, so that reduces concerns about ""¶ nonnative species in a net pen situation,""ù she said. ""[The fact] that the farmed form is more desired from a marketing perspective [means] it's not competing with the wild fish, so it's good for commercial and recreational fishermen as well.""ù In light of these many public anxieties, NOAA asserts that they are doing extensive research into the environmental impact in order to fully understand any potentially harmful impacts before any development is done, and they added that they have a responsibility to address all concerns the public may have.† Windham, however, says that the aquaculture industry and the science behind it has evolved considerably. She also emphasized that the industry doesn't want to pollute the water or damage the surrounding ecosystem either. ""I will say that the offshore aquaculture industry is much more advanced than I think the general public is aware of,""ù Windham said. ""The aquaculture industry needs healthy, clean water too. They need healthy, clean water to grow healthy, clean fish.""ù†† The U.S. currently imports about 75-80% of its fish, 50% of which were grown in foreign aquaculture systems, which, Windham points out, might not be up to the standards the U.S. strives to meet. With our growing need to be able to feed our increasingly large population, and considering the substantial health benefits the consumption of seafood can provide, Windham stated that these new domestic aquaculture sites could be an opportunity to ""shape the industry [and] to be the very best that it can be.""ù A pilot kelp farm in the Santa Barbara Channel that is experimentally growing kelp for biofuel. (Courtesy of Ocean Rainforest.) She clarified that while the conversation surrounding these AOAs tends to focus on finfish farms, potential sites are being identified for many types of aquaculture, including shellfish and macroalgae farms as well. Additionally, she said, the proposed sites will not be on the massive scale of other global aquaculture ventures.† ""I'm sure you've seen photos of aquaculture in other parts of the world ""î in Asia for example ""î where it's just pens and structures as far as the eye can see. That kind of density is not what we're hoping to accomplish in the United States,""ù Windham said. ""You can actually grow a fair amount of protein [with] a very small footprint, so we don't even necessarily need to go to that huge scale, especially if we're producing for domestic supply.""ù After the initial identification of potential sites, the public was able to submit comments during a ""public scoping period""ù from May to July 2020 on points of concern regarding a variety of topics. A ""Notice of Intent""ù provided 16 prompts covering such things as specific AOA location and parameters, chosen species for cultivation, tribal involvement, climate change and reporting requirements to which various stakeholders could respond to.† NOAA Fisheries, also known as the National Marine Fisheries Service, West Coast Region (WCR) will, according to the public scoping report, ""consider all substantive information from [public] comments and supplementary information to build the content of the draft PEIS [Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement].""ù† The draft PEIS, set to be published in summer 2024, is compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act process and will provide a spatial analysis of the local marine areas to help determine locations with the most promise of being able to support more than one farm, as the executive order outlines, as well as other valuable information for future development.† ""With the Programmatic EIS at hand, an applicant can get a familiarity with that ocean neighborhood of where they are hoping to site a farm and be better able to estimate where they have the greatest likelihood of successfully getting a permit,""ù Windham said. ""The AOA process and [the] PEIS will give the industry more information, as well as the stakeholder community so you're not starting from scratch, you already have a baseline of info that you can build upon with your individual project specifics.""ù NOAA WCR Public Affairs Specialist Matthew Burks added that by doing this research, they are simply trying to relieve some of the planning stress of individuals that may eventually be interested in practicing aquaculture.† ""[The AOAs] are not available yet, no one can apply for permits yet, but that's really what this effort is on our end ""î just doing the research for people so that in the future when they want to actually perform these activities, some of the work has already been done.""ù† Once the draft PEIS is published in 2024, there will be another public comment period, likely lasting six weeks, during which the public can again provide feedback on the report and express any remaining concerns, which will be followed by the publication of the final PEIS and Record of Decision in summer 2025. The project is still very early in the process, and even if permitting begins soon after the PEIS publication, it can often take a few years before any development will occur.† † CORRECTION [4/17/23, 7:08 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Executive Order 13921 would legalize fish farming in federal waters. This article has been corrected to reflect that the Executive Order would instead promote aquaculture of various kinds in federal waters. Additionally, the article now clarifies the fact that not only do the AOAs encompass many types of aquaculture, not just finfish farming, offshore finfish farming specifically can take on many forms, from small-scale to large scale, and can be located both near coastlines and in open ocean.

science,The Cannabis Classification Conundrum,20-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Olivia Gil de Bernabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-20/the-cannabis-classification-conundrum/,"As more states legalize recreational cannabis use, the demand for cannabinoid research to better understand public health implications and inform growth and distribution policy grows. Despite the urgency of this need, studies researching cannabis varieties are few and far between. The cause of this supply-demand research mismatch is entirely due to the federal drug classification of cannabis. The U.S Drug Enforcement Administration categorizes controlled substances into five ranked classes. Classification is based on two criteria: potential for abuse, determined by the addictive nature of the substance, and medical value.† Schedule Five drugs are considered as having the lowest potential for abuse and greatest medical value. On the other side of the spectrum, Schedule One drugs are regarded as having the highest potential for abuse and are considered to have no medical value. Cannabis lies in the Schedule One category, classed among drugs like heroin and ecstasy regardless of THC value. As a point of reference, cocaine is nestled in the Schedule Two category, meaning that it is federally recognized as having less potential for abuse and greater medical value than cannabis.  In 2018, the Farm Bill modified the federal definition of cannabis by defining cannabinoids as either marijuana, meaning it has over 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, or industrial hemp (under 0.3% content). Among other researchers, The National Council of State Legislatures argues that the 0.3 is unfounded in scientific evidence and is an arbitrary assignment. †The classification of the drug that people use recreationally and casually has left people puzzled. In a journal article outlining the conundrum of this classification, Sandler et. al wrote, ""By regulating hemp seed as a controlled substance, the [Department of Justice] DOJ impedes those states that seek to plant and do research on Cannabis as a viable crop.""ù †This Schedule One classification requires that researchers obtain a Schedule One license that allows them to study hemp that is cultivated under highly controlled environments. As such, the strains differ widely in the variations utilized recreationally, limiting the true validity of experimental results. Comments are closed.

science,The Link Between Schizophrenia and Cannabis Use,20-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Olivia Gil de Bernabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-20/the-link-between-schizophrenia-and-cannabis-use/,"""ã""ãResearch indicates that people with a family history of psychotic disorders should exercise caution when it comes to cannabinoid use. Published systematic reviews such as a paper titled ""Cannabis and Psychosis: Are We any Closer to Understanding the Relationship?""ù†summarize experimental studies that echo iterations of a concerning conclusion: when psychotic symptoms predating the onset of cannabis use are controlled for, individuals who are genetically predisposed to psychosis are more likely to experience a psychotic outcome following exposure to cannabis. Specifically, the psychosis outcomes identified are those of schizophrenia, a chronic mental disorder that is characterized by symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behavior/thinking and/or the absence of emotional expressions.† In addition to finding that the use of cannabinoids can trigger schizophrenic symptoms in those who are genetically predisposed, researchers have also found that cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms in people already diagnosed with psychosis.† While the neurological mechanisms supporting these findings are not entirely understood, a popular theory is based on the understanding that schizophrenia is caused by abnormal brain structural development. Cannabinoids are known to interfere with brain development processes. Increasing evidence also suggests that two factors increase the risk of developing a psychotic factor: early and heavy cannabis exposure. Essentially, individuals at greatest risk for cannabis-induced psychosis are those who began frequent cannabinoid use at an early age.† Researchers investigating the associations between schizophrenia and cannabis emphasize that more experimental research studies are necessary to determine a causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia. All the same, they assert the need for awareness campaigns to inform young people about the risk of psychosis associated with cannabis use.† Comments are closed.

science,Simply Stated: Do you know your weed?,20-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Meenakshi Manoj'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-20/simply-stated-do-you-know-your-weed/,"The cannabis plant, a leafy green plant† of phytocannabinoids, a class of naturally occurring chemical compounds, and terpenoid, tiny and strong-smelling molecules produced in thousands of different plant species. Phytocannabinoids in marijuana are responsible for interacting with the brain and body via cellular receptors and chemical interactions, while terpenoids are essential oils that give marijuana its scent and flavor.† The two main phytocannabinoids are Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which causes intoxication and is what gives an individual a state of euphoria, and Cannabidiol (CBD) which has potential therapeutic benefits. Levels of THC have been increasing in cannabis as growers try to create hybrids of the substance with greater concentrations of THC. Low doses of THC are associated with reduced anxiety and stress, while† high doses may have adverse ""psychotomimetic""ù effects such as augmented anxiety and paranoia levels.  CBD, on the other hand, is non-euphoric and has medical† benefits associated with reduced pain or nausea and the potential to prevent seizures and alleviate migraines. Marijuana is a specific strain of cannabis that is more than 0.3% THC by weight. Strains of cannabis that are less than 0.3% THC by weight are classified as hemp or a cannabidiol product. There are several forms of cannabis: Sativa plants with its thin and tall frame take longer to mature. They typically have lower doses of CBD and higher doses of THC. This ratio creates the feeling of highness and can reduce anxiety and stress while increasing creativity and focus when consumed.† Indica plants have more physical than mental effects on the body. Due to its higher dose of CBD and myrcene, this variant of marijuana helps with sleep and relaxing or calming the muscles in individuals experiencing anxiety or insomnia. Combinations of sativa and indica marijuana are classified into three categories. Type one has a high THC dosage, type two is the most common and has a hybrid of THC and CBD and type three has a high dosage of CBD.† Although THC and CBD are the main phytocannabinoids, others include Cannabinol (CBN), Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), and Cannabigerol (CBG). CBN can ease the symptoms of neurological conditions like epilepsy or seizures. THCA may be able to reduce arthritis, autoimmune inflammation and potentially reduce symptoms of conditions like Parkison's and ALS. THCA acts similarly to THC minus the psychoactive effects that give a person the state of the euphoria associated with marijuana use. Lastly, CBG is believed to reduce symptoms of depression, post traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. A general rule of thumb is that marijuana with a CBD to THC ratio of 80:20 is most suitable for beginners, and one can progress to a 50:50 or 1:1 ratio strain once more comfortable with the potent psychoactive effects. Specifically, strains of marijuana best-suited for beginners include sativa-dominant Blue Dream, high-CBD Cannatonic, CBD-rich Harlequin, indica-dominant Northern Lights, and indica-dominant Hindu Kush. Each strain has a different balance of the terpenes, which causes for each strain to have slightly different effects. More recently, studies are determining that terpenes can significantly influence the body with marijuana use in a positive way. A few important chemical compounds that are found in different strains of marijuana include bisabolol, caryophyllene, mycenae, pinene, terpinolene, limonene and eucalyptol.† The effect or absorption of marijuana after consuming an edible contrasts the effect of smoking a joint of marijuana greatly. When taking an edible, absorption begins in the salivary glands under the tongue so an edible doesn't have to be swallowed in order to have an effect. If ingested, the chemical contents of the edible pass through the liver before an effect of ""òhighness' is perceived. Absorption can take as long as 30 to 60 minutes before reaching the brain when marijuana is ingested. The effects onset more gradually, but last much longer.† Smoking a joint or out of a bong, on the other hand, allows an individual to feel the effects of THC or intoxication more rapidly. The nearly immediate effect comes at a cost, however, as smoking marijuana is linked with adverse effects on respiratory health. The reported set of risks associated with smoking marijuana is highly similar to the consequences of smoking tobacco, which include airway inflammation, barotrauma ""î tissue damage due to compressive and expansive forces that causes shear stress and the overstretching of tissue in the sinuses or the lungs ""î and obstructive pulmonary issues. Other forms of taking marijuana include tinctures (alcohol), vaping and topicals (lotions or oils). Both medical-use and recreational-use marijuana have no significant difference in THC dosage and strain of marijuana that is provided. The main distinction between the two categories is that individuals seeking to purchase marijuana for medical purposes must have a healthcare provider's authorization and approval from the state, while anyone of at least 21 years can purchase recreational marijuana. There is still insufficient data on the long-lasting and overall health effects of potent marijuana as well as the different strains of the product. In the short term, marijuana is an addictive substance. According to American Addiction Centers, "" about 14.2 million people, aged 12 or older, struggled with marijuana addiction in 2020.""ù The National Institution on Drug Abuse determined that marijuana dependency or addiction occurs ""when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug by reducing production of and sensitivity to its own endocannabinoid neurotransmitters.""ù Therefore, an individual could develop marijuana-use disorders if they did not control their use or consumption of marijuana. It poses psychological risks. It can lead to consequences such as poor memory, muscle coordination, and paranoia. It can have negative effects such as poor immunity, cancer, impaired memory and cardiac or pulmonary complications in the long run. For these reasons, it is crucial to be wary and responsible when taking marijuana for medical or recreational use. Takeaways on marijuana use.† It is always valuable to weigh both the potential beneficial and adverse effects of consuming or smoking different strains of marijuana. To the now informed marijuana users, enjoy yourself while staying safe! As Russell Brand says in his book, ""My Booky Wook,""ù ""We all need something to help us unwind at the end of the day""¶† to silence your silly brainbox of its witterings but there has to be some form of punctuation, or life just seems utterly relentless.""ù†

science,MethaneMapper: A new effective AI-based tool for methane detection,27-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Katharine Chi'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-27/methanemapper-a-new-effective-ai-based-tool-for-methane-detection/,"From erratic weather patterns to increasing occurrences of hurricanes, the climate crisis is worsening by the minute. The main component of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions, with methane in particular accounting for 30% of the rise in global temperature. This wide-scale emergency calls for innovative solutions that have the potential to mitigate the disastrous consequences of human activity.† Graduate student researcher Satish Kumar works for the Vision Research Lab at UC Santa Barbara and has been working on MethaneMapper, an AI-based tool that detects and quantifies levels of methane in a given area. Kumar focuses on hyperspectral imaging, a technique that analyzes a wide spectrum of light rather than assigning each pixel in an image to red, green and blue.† Greenhouse emissions are undetectable under regular vision systems, but with respect to hyperspectral imaging, Kumar said, ""Since you have such a refined spectral range, you can capture any particular type of gas that you're focusing on.""ù While working at the Vision Research Lab, Kumar has focused on grid detecting emissions of greenhouse gas, specifically in the setting of the oil and natural gas industry.† Coming from a background in signal processing ""î an engineering subfield that focuses on the analysis, modification and synthesis of signals that can be in the form of sounds, images and seismic waves.† Kumar was able to incorporate this knowledge into the machine learning algorithms that make up MethaneMapper. Machine learning algorithms are designed to recognize patterns and adapt based on the data given.† ""We thought we could solve the problem in a better way with machine learning compared to the existing methods which are heavily dependent on subject knowledge and are tuned [only] for certain locations. So, we thought maybe machine learning can make a network learn about everything,""ù Kumar said in regards to implementing machine learning algorithms. In terms of target detection and methane identification in hyperspectral imaging, machine learning approaches are prominently used. MethaneMapper uses a hyperspectral transformer for methane plume detection. In order to improve traditional transformer designs, two modules, Spectral Feature Generator (SFG) and Query Refiner (QR) work together in order to enable the localization of potential methane hot spots in the hyperspectral images.† † Diagram depicting MethaneMapper in action. Courtesy of Vision Research Lab, UCSB. Both SFG and QR are machine learning systems, but the SFG takes in the channels of a hyperspectral image and processes it through a linear filter that outputs the weight mean of input values, then the QR uses the methane candidates to refine the learnable queries. In addition, the hyperspectral decoder uses the results from the QR in order to generate the final prediction of methane plumes. The system works through functional stages of data filtration, extraction, refinement, decoding and encoding.† The detection of greenhouse gasses is critical and MethaneMapper works to detect the emissions that go undetected because of the government's struggle to find an accurate method of detection. Kumar said that in the Texas Permian Basin alone, there are 86,000 oil emissions, and like other oil extraction sites, they are emitting great amounts of methane into the atmosphere.† MethaneMapper has the potential to provide a detection system that quantifies emissions and localizes the source of emissions. It is possible that the government could implement MethaneMapper in the future as a way to quantify emissions and impose regulations on the oil and natural gas industry. Methane is one of the greatest contributors to global warming.† †""The amount of damage carbon dioxide is going to have in 100 years, [is equal to the damage methane] will have in just 1.2 years. And that's why we need to find out where the emissions are coming from, and most major emissions are from the oil and natural gas industry,""ù Kumar said. MethaneMapper has been recognized as being the top 2% of all works in any given field and has been given special attention at the world's most prestigious Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference, which will take place in Vancouver during late June. Kumar and his team have successfully developed a state-of-the-art AI-based tool that is highly effective at identifying methane emissions, and in doing so, has the ability to mitigate the impact of potential greenhouse gasses on the environment.† The MethaneMapper project is funded by the National Science Foundation award SI2-SSI #1664172. The project is part of ""Center for Multimodal Big Data Science and Healthcare""ù at UCSB.

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,27-Apr-23,9:00 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-27/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-19/,"Technology Trajectories† We live in a world where technology is constantly evolving, and there is less consideration of instances where old technology takes the stage. Mary Tripsas, a professor of technology management in the College of Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, recently published a paper alongside collaborators that discusses the reemergence of old technologies and how occupations might be a driving factor of these events. Specifically, their research focuses on the music synthesizer and the transitions from analog to digital synthesizers to the recent reemergence of analog. A music synthesizer is a musical instrument that produces sounds by generating signals. Digital synthesizers rely upon digital signal processing technology while analog synthesizers use real circuits to produce sounds. Jack Antonoff, best known for his work with artists Taylor Swift and Lorde, as well as his contributions to the bands fun. and Bleachers, is one example of a professional musician using analog synthesizers despite living in the age of digital. In this study, Tripsas and her collaborators extracted data from Keyboard magazine by analyzing 476 interviews from 1975-2016. These interviews specifically included synthesizer-related topics. It was found that the reemergence of analog technology was due to musicians' difficulty finding creative expression while digital synthesizers became universal. Musicians additionally found that the digital synthesizer was not as efficient for control and expertise. Although the rise of old or vintage technologies might commonly be chalked up to retro trends in consumer markets, this research shows that occupational factors are important considerations in technology trends and trajectories. The paper also discussed how occupations might affect technology trends and vice versa, and it emphasized that gaining more insight on this relationship would be relevant to future studies on technology trajectories. Coral Bleaching† Reef recovery can be difficult to study due to coral's extensive life span and long period of recovery. To work around this, UCSB doctoral candidate Kai Kopecky established with a mathematical model for reef dynamics after major events such as bleaching events and storms. Coral bleaching occurs due to conditions such as high temperatures that affect the symbiotic relationship between corals and algae. The colorful algae are expelled under stress and leave the coral bare and exposed. This type of event leaves white coral skeletons on the reef, whereas storms commonly wipe the area clean of coral structures. The island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia has been studied by UCSB researchers for decades, and its coral reef ecosystem has recently experienced a major bleaching event. Past research in this ecosystem has shown that the reef has historically been coral dominated or seaweed dominated.† Kopecky wanted to develop a method to predict whether the reef was moving toward a seaweed-dominated ecosystem due to the bleaching. In order to quantify reef disturbances, a model was developed using variables such as live and dead coral, exposed and protected algae and empty areas that could potentially be colonized by either coral or algae. Parameters such as growth rate of coral and algae, death and erosion rate of coral and overgrowth rate of algae were also considered in the model. The results of Kopecky's study showed that events like bleaching can be a hindrance to coral recovery. This is due to coral skeletons' ability to provide algae with protection from herbivores, which could ultimately allow the ecosystem to become algae dominated. Kopecky and his collaborators have found that these coral skeletons, referred to as material legacies, can affect ecosystem resilience and alter the trajectory of the ecosystem. Future studies might focus on how material legacies of disturbances affect other ecosystems in addition to coral reefs. Forests and Climate Change† Many carbon-offset projects are currently underway to protect forests that serve as a carbon sink and reduce atmospheric carbon levels. However, new research has shown that many of these areas are projected to lose carbon within the next century. Anna Trugman, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography at UCSB, recently published a study in collaboration with researchers at the University of Utah on how different forests and tree species might be affected by climate change. Many different approaches were used in the study, such as climate projections, data from long-term forests, identification of preferred climate niches by tree species via machine learning and models considering the relationship between ecosystem and atmosphere. The benefit of using a variety of models is to account for factors that other methods might not take into consideration.† Researchers found that some areas, such as the Great Lakes, were projected to gain carbon, while other areas showed a high risk of losing carbon due to three factors: forest fires, climate stress and insect damage. In addition, the analysis showed that many carbon-offset projects are located in areas with the highest risk of losing carbon due to these factors. The study highlighted the urgency of implementing these findings in order to protect and maintain forests that will be better able to gain carbon in the face of climate risks. However, there are still many unanswered questions that need to be addressed, including how resilient biomes are from disturbances and the complexity of how forests are affected by risk factors. Gaining a better understanding of these unknowns will give researchers a better idea of how conservation projects should be conducted to most effectively reduce atmospheric carbon levels.

In a study of brine flies, a mainstay food source for migratory water birds that often visit these lakes to birth their young, David Herbst, a researcher at the UC Santa Barbara's Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory, reveals that the salinity of these lakes that was previously kept in check via certain minerals has risen to unprecedented levels, lowering the reproductive capabilities of these flies.† Herbst has been studying how this sudden demographic change spells trouble for the wider salt lake. ""As expected, reduced amounts of the algae that fly larvae feed on also limits their growth, yet this, too, is likely to occur as salinities rise,""ù he said.† Alongside losses of plant and animal life, the salt lakes are enduring a period of growing dryness as these droughts persist forward.†The paper goes on to describe ongoing conservation efforts to protect these salt lakes, including a more detailed study of how exactly brine flies are correlated with climate change's effect on lakebound ecosystems. This cause has received federal attention, as a recent $25 million grant given to the U.S. Geological Survey will allow the resources, time and opportunities necessary to understand the greater implications of brine fly reproductive slowness and drought's effect on salt lakes as a whole. Detecting a gas giant Thayne Currie, a member of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and his team have managed to acquire images of gas giant exoplanets within our solar system. These images provided immense insight into the nature of their atmospheres and planetary architecture. Compounding these findings is the detection of a possible new gas giant near the star HIP 99770. Numerous discoveries were made about this gas giant's makeup, including its temperature, surface gravity, cloudiness and chemical composition. But, Currie's team was unable to discern the planet's astrometry due to the limitations of current technology.  So, many specifics regarding this unnamed gas giant's atmosphere and planetary architecture remain unknown. This paper also describes HIP 99770's similarities and differences with planets in our own solar system, including an estimation of the planet's orbital properties and mass. Without doubt, such inquiries will expand our view of the cosmic neighborhood we occupy, and perhaps someday, we may hope to learn even more about HIP 99770 and gas giants akin to it.

science,UCSB students join latest efforts in search for life on Mars,4-May-23,9:00 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-04/ucsb-students-join-latest-efforts-in-search-for-life-on-mars/,"For decades, scientists have been searching for an answer to the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe? Many of them have turned their attention to the planet Mars, including a team involving students from UC Santa Barbara.† Chris Temby is a recent UCSB graduate who, at the end of this past quarter, received his bachelor's degree in physics with a minor in both astronomy and planetary sciences and history. Last year, he and his colleague Yael Brynjegard-Bialik, a current fourth-year physics major, joined the Agnostic Life Finding Association's Mars exploration team (ALFA Mars) ""î a program funded by the Foundation For Applied Molecular Evolution (FfAME ) ""î and have since been swept up in the search for extraterrestrial life.† ALFA Mars is working to create an Agnostic Life Finder (ALF) device, which ultimately aims to filter Martian water in order to collect, sort and identify potential microbes and organic molecules, particularly DNA or other heritable material.† Not only would ALF work by separating molecules by size, but it would also separate them by charge using an electric field. This is a crucial detail because our hereditary material, DNA, is negatively charged, and thus would be attracted to a positive electrode.† ""The phosphodiester backbone of this DNA is a repeating negative charge, and that's important for multiple reasons,""ù Temby said. ""Basically, the general scientific community believes in the polyelectrolyte theory of the gene, [which says that for] any informational structure, that would be the biomolecule that would be the [heritable material], ""¶ should always have a repeating charge on it.""ù† He explained that DNA on Earth just so happens to have a repeating negative charge, but it's not necessarily negative. Other structures that don't have a repeating charge, like proteins, can fold over on themselves ""î something necessary for them to gain their correct structure and function. For DNA, however, this folding would not be optimal due to the need for clear access to the nucleotides for cellular processes to occur.† In short, if the genetic material could be identified and isolated, scientists would be able to study it in a lab setting and figure out its origins.† So where would the water that ALF would work to filter come from? It is widely believed that there is a large subsurface reservoir of water and ice on Mars and that this water will soon be found and harnessed. Temby also mentioned the 2008 Phoenix lander, which found ice within an inch of the Martian surface. As water cannot exist stably on the surface of the planet, this would be a massive step toward possible Martian exploration and colonization. Finding a substantial water source on Mars would enable the extraction and use of the water in in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), which is essentially a system that will allow astronauts to use Martian resources and eliminate the need for complete dependence on those brought from Earth.† ""NASA or SpaceX is going to want to send humans there, but in order to send humans to Mars the idea would be that you have a way to get them back before they even get there ""¶ [and] in order to do that you need to have a rocket full of fuel, and even in order to do that, you need to have rocket fuel,""ù Temby said. ""People don't want to send a rocket full of rocket fuel because that's really expensive, so the better option is to make rocket fuel on Mars.""ù He went on to explain that the way astronauts would ultimately be able to create their own rocket fuel from resources on Mars would be to use the Sabatier reaction. This reaction takes water and separates it into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can then be combined with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to create methane, to be used as fuel, and purified water for the astronauts to drink. This Martian water is therefore the key to Mars exploration for humans, according to Temby.† He added that his team hopes to be able to send ALF to Mars even before anyone starts trying to harness water for energy.† ""People are going to have to mine tons of Martian water, literally tons of it, so why don't we just send a little device that's as big as this napkin holder ""î pretty small ""î [which will] take a couple of watts of power per day ""¶ and basically is just an add-on to the whole ISRU infrastructure to mine tons of Martian water,""ù Temby said. ""Before you do this whole reaction and processing, let's just sample some of it and look for life on Mars.""ù† Since the Viking landers of 1976, there hasn't been much work in the life-detection field, partially due to the controversy created by the missions' inconclusive results regarding whether life has existed on Mars at all. ALFA Mars, however, aims to change that.† Temby predicts that if life were found on Mars, it would upend countless human belief systems and areas of knowledge, including those of religion and philosophy. ""It would disrupt a lot of religious paradigms,""ù he said.† He mentioned that the discovery of life on Mars would also have great implications for the field of biochemistry.† ""Right now in the field of astrobiology, we only have one example of what life is in the universe: We have life on Earth, and that's it. Some of it uses RNA, and some of it uses DNA, but that's all we have,""ù he said.† He said that with a second example of biology, we'll finally be able to better understand ""universal truths""ù and even be able to make assumptions about possible life on other planets.† In the case that life is found on Mars, one of the major questions will be how to tell that it indeed evolved there and didn't come from somewhere else. One possibility is always that the microbes could be a result of planetary contamination from Earth due to improper sanitization of ships, but Temby doesn't think that is very likely.† He does, however, believe that there is a good chance that if there is life on Mars, it would be very similar to life on Earth.† ""A lot of the minerals that are believed to be really important in the making of life on Earth are found on Mars ""¶ But the real question is would [the heritable material] be DNA or would it not be DNA?""ù he said.†† Nevertheless, Temby believes there is a pretty good chance we could see humans on Mars within the next 20 years and possibly even an entire colony by the end of this century. Once humans get to Mars, and if they happen to discover life forms, next steps would include ensuring that it actually is Martian genetic material, sequencing DNA or other material if it is and ultimately recovering a full genome.† † Devon Island, Canada, the largest uninhabited region in the world, was chosen as a test site due to its remarkable likeness to the Martian landscape. COURTESY OF STORE NORSKE LEKSIKON. However, before any of that can occur, the team first needs to test the ALF technology on Earth in an environment that might approximate conditions on Mars. Ideally, the plan is for some of the team, likely Temby and potentially Brynjegard-Bialik, to go to Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic for four weeks this summer to help refurbish the research station there, field-test ALF and do general landscape surveys. Temby would likely also serve as mission scientist, helping to produce vlog-style videos to capture the process of this initial phase.† Of course, such plans can be expensive. To send just one person to the Arctic this summer would require up to $25,000. They already have a few thousand dollars secured as well as some pledged support from the Mars Society and FfAME. In addition, they are engaging in fundraising activities in the local community.† They also hope to be able to send a group of five to six ALFA Mars students from all over the world to Devon Island next summer to do physical, physiological, geological and microbiological testing.† ""We just need money,""ù Temby said. ""For this year, it's a time crunch ""¶ but for next year we're trying to get bigger corporate sponsorships.""ù Financial challenges aside, Temby remains confident regarding the potential implications of finding life on Mars.† ""I think it would be the most profound scientific discovery of all time,""ù he said. ""It seems like one of the oldest questions that humanity could ever ask is ""òAre we alone?'""ù†† CORRECTION [5/7/23, 9:43 a.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the group of scientists and students attempting to look for life on Mars was called ""Alpha Mars.""ù This article has been corrected to reflect that the group is actually named ""The Agnostic Life Finding Association (ALFA Mars)""ù. Additionally, the article now includes a link to the organizations website for readers who are interested in learning more.

science,"I feel, therefore I am: Leading neuroscientist Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio speaks on human consciousness",11-May-23,9:00 AM,['Olivia Gil de Bernabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-11/i-feel-therefore-i-am-leading-neuroscientist-antonio-damasio-speaks-on-human-consciousness/,"""I think, therefore I am.""ù† Many of us are familiar with the Cartesian notion of the thinking nature of consciousness. Ren√© Descartes, it turns out, was wrong. That's according to Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio, a leading neuroscientist in the origin of consciousness. One of the world's most cited scientists, Dam√°sio has authored several books on his life's findings, such as ""Descartes' Error.""ù On April 17, he spoke on the true nature of consciousness as part of the series, ""Celebrating the Carnation Revolution: A Conference in Honor of Eduardo Louren√ßo,""ù organized by the UC Santa Barbara Center for Portuguese Studies.†† Consciousness, the recognition of the self and awareness of oneself in one's surroundings, is a process scholars have long struggled to understand. Because scientists have historically regarded reason as a virtue of value, while viewing emotion as less dignified, people were desperate to believe that consciousness is housed in the brain's highest form of thinking. †Dam√°sio argues that this top-to-bottom approach to consciousness cannot uncover its true nature because consciousness actually arises from the opposite direction.†† ""Consciousness comes gurgling,""ù Dam√°sio said, imitating a bubbling stream with his hands, ""from something deep in our nature: feeling.""ù †I feel, therefore I am. Dam√°sio speaking at the Fronteiras do Pensamento conference in 2013. WIKIMEDIA. An everyday cooking experience can illustrate this bottom-top understanding of consciousness. Picture yourself, in the midst of preparing a meal, carelessly grabbing a searing hot baking sheet. Yowch! The unbearable pain compels you to drop the pan immediately. In less than a second, the hand's sensory receptors fired a signal to the brain, neurons registered the sensation of pain, and motor neurons carried out the instruction to reduce harm through a behavioral response. The feeling of pain, rather than a thoughtful analysis of it, brought about awareness of the body. ""Feelings are the ambassadors of the state of life in your organism,""ù Dam√°sio said.†† Sensations such as feeling hot or cold, hunger, thirst, and even heartbreak, bring awareness to the fact that the body has strayed from homeostasis.† †""Once you notice these things, conscious intervention allows you to make a deliberate decision as to what to do next,""ù he said.† †Contrary to the belief of past scholars, consciousness is not attributed entirely to the brain. Rather, it emerges from an intermarriage of the brain and non-neural cells. †""Consciousness is about experience. It's internal, and it's private. You can make guesses about what is going on in somebody's mind, but you have no authority or capacity to know,""ù Dam√°sio continued.† †When you walk out the door on a summer morning, the warmth you receive from the sun and your visual perception of the blue sky tell you, through a qualitative, positive feeling, that it's a good day. No one knows you've reached this conclusion, that is unless you turn to your friend and say, ""What a lovely day!""ù† Language provides us with the ability to communicate our conscious experience. From here, Dam√°sio revealed how our understanding of consciousness is intrinsically tied to the value of literature. †At its best, creative writing captures the subtleties of complex human emotion. Good literature externalizes a person's conscious experience well, providing a vessel from which we can muse over the nuanced human experience. Literature opens us to the understanding that while our individual experience is private, others have experienced it too. †""Is it the case that literature itself is going to alter the way we are conscious? I would say yes,""ù Dam√°sio said. In other words, engaging with literature can alter the way we experience the world.† †Dam√°sio's top-bottom understanding of consciousness poses implications for our understanding of AI machine limitations like ChatGPT. The chatbot can produce written†work""îlike essays, short stories, and poems""îat a moment's notice, leading some to argue that it can functionally replace human creative writers. As Dam√°sio argues, consciousness arises from feeling, and our ability to feel is intrinsic to the production of literature. How, then, can an unfeeling and unconscious entity actually portray the human experience as it is? It may explain why ChatGPT passed many rigorous exams with flying colors, except for two: English language and literature. †""Do you need consciousness for language? No,""ù Dam√°sio said. ""But in order to use language consciously, in order to use it creatively, we definitely need to be conscious.""ù

When neurons fire, the body releases electric chemicals neuroscience call neurotransmitters, and psychologists call emotions.

science,"Simply Stated: How does academic stress affect mental health, and where on campus can students go for care?",11-May-23,9:00 AM,['Samarah Paulino'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-11/simply-stated-how-does-academic-stress-affect-mental-health-and-where-on-campus-can-students-go-for-care/,"SIMONE MANSELL / DAILY NEXUS It's not a surprise when I say that school can be stressful. With midterms coming to an end, or still in progress for some, a lot of us have experienced or are experiencing some sort of stress. Studying for these exams is of course very important; but while doing so, people tend to neglect both their mental and physical well-being. Prioritizing these exams over everything else may seem like the key to good grades; however, this strategy is not as beneficial as some people may think. A study conducted by Michaela Pascoe, a researcher with Victoria University, Melbourne, found that a high percentage of students experience academic stress. Out of the 540,000 students surveyed, 55% experience anxiety over upcoming tests with 37% feeling stressed and tense while studying. Experiencing built-up levels of stress can eventually lead to the degradation of our mental health by leading to issues such as poor sleep and substance abuse or possibly even triggering anxiety and depression. Stress plays a role in the impairment of sleep for many adolescents. Dr. Annise Wilson, assistant professor at the BaylorCollege of Medicine, states how high stress levels can affect how long it takes for one to fall asleep and how often they are able to remain asleep. This is due to continuous thoughts that prevent our brain from getting to the relaxed state needed to fall asleep. Getting a good night's rest is also linked to many important brain functions that allow us to get through our daily lives. Not getting enough sleep can affect our cognitive skills, such as our ability to stay focused and retain information and can even cause changes to our moods and behaviors.† Stress can also increase the use of substances as well as the risk of addiction. In a survey of 11th grade high school students from the U.S., a high percentage of students who reported feeling academic stress also reported drug and alcohol use as a way to manage that stress. The feelings of stress and anxiety caused by the desire for high academic achievement and success caused many to turn to substances as a coping mechanism. Although dangerous levels of usage were not reported, repeated and frequent use can lessen our ability to control our intake and increase our cravings for more, which as a result causes addiction and damage, not only to our mental health but also our physical health. High levels of academic stress can also trigger more serious mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression. Anxiety can be triggered due to stress heightening our sensitivity to bodily sensations and focus toward negative or uncertain outcomes. In addition, a positive association was found between anxiety sensitivity and depressive symptoms. This means that the fear of the behaviors and emotions that come with anxiety can lead one to experience symptoms of depression. The best thing you can do for your mental health is to address the issue and make time for yourself. Picking up a hobby, participating in an activity or joining a club that interests you is a great way to take your mind off of school while also having fun. It is also just as effective to seek help. Seeking help from health care professionals is always advisable if you are having a hard time dealing with any aspect of life. Thankfully, there are many resources on campus that you can take advantage of when in need of professional help. UC Santa Barbara's Counseling & Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) provides a variety of services that are available to everyone. Short-term, long-term and group counseling sessions are available as well as a 75-minute single session therapy. All of these programs are tailored to you and your needs, and they can help to address any personal concern you may have in or outside of school. C.A.P.S. also offers the Mental Health Peer Program, a support program managed by fellow UCSB students with the goal of spreading mental health awareness and providing guidance and support to struggling students. Getting support can also be done in the comfort of your own home. C.A.P.S. and UC Los Angeles Health offer meditation recordings that are free to listen to. The goal of these podcasts are to free your body of tension and promote mindfulness and relief. These recordings can be listened to at any hour of the day; however, UCLA Health also offers weekly drop-in sessions that you can join and listen to in real time. Whatever emotions you may be feeling are completely normal and valid. Everyone deals with some sort of distress, not only from school but from life in general. It is important to remember that there are people that care and are willing to help.

Moreover, scientists have observed another macrophage behavior, in which they ""nibble""ù on pathogens by biting off small chunks at a time. This behavior, called trogocytosis, is quite common in interactions between macrophages and cancer cells. Scientists studying the behavior have identified a potential application to cancer immunotherapy treatments. First-year Biology and English double major Kathleen Zhang worked under UC Santa Barbara faculty member, Meghan Morrissey of the Morrissey Lab, to investigate why macrophage nibbling is only sometimes lethal and how the manipulation of cancer cell gene expression might make them more prone to death from trogocytosis. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, Zhang knocked down specific genes to compromise cellular functions and produce internal stress.The induced stress may cause cells to be more prone to death when encountering trogocytosis by macrophages. In order to further investigate this process and its effectiveness, Zhang will be measuring trogocytosis by using time-lapses and fluorescence markers. This will quantify the nibbling done by the macrophages, allowing them to analyze the proportion of cell deaths due to trogocytosis. Because macrophage nibbling has potential to increase cancer cell death, this research has important applications for developing more effective cancer immunotherapy treatments. Function of neural-like proteins in single-celled eukaryotes The post-synaptic cells in our neuronal synapses have receptors that are secured in place by a scaffolding protein called postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). Although single-celled eukaryotes have no nervous system, these organisms also possess the PSD-95 protein. Second-year biology major Riya Nilkant worked with Principal Investigators Kenneth Kosik and Soojin Yi of the Kosik Lab to discover the unknown function of PSD-95 in single-celled eukaryotes and whether it can provide any insight on the origin and evolution of the synapse.† Nilkant, having found that there are nine amino acid residues involved in binding within PSD-95, produced a matrix by calculating every possible distance between atoms within the binding site. Hydrophobic regions and phi and psi angles were identified to distinguish the protein's orientation in space. It's the first known study to quantify the binding pocket of the PSD-95 protein with these methods. Nilkant plans to further observe the function of PSD-95 in the lab. A part of the PSD-95 protein will be inserted into a plasmid, a circular piece of DNA, which will be placed into a neural cell. Comparing areas that fluoresce to PSD-95 protein in its natural state can help determine the protein's function. This research may have important applications in understanding the neurological basis of conditions such as Alzheimer's and autism.†† Detection of pathogenic eDNA in soils Amphibians, like frogs and salamanders, are threatened by a pathogenic fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a disease caused by zoospores that infect the skin. Bd can be detected through environmental DNA (eDNA), DNA that organisms deposit into the environment. However, eDNA is susceptible to degradation due to different biotic and abiotic factors. Fourth-year EEMB major Kathryn Koo worked with UCSB PhD student Caitlin Nordheim of the Cherie Briggs Lab to investigate whether storage duration at 4∞C, soil type, or initial Bd dose affected the detection of Bd eDNA in soil samples. A ""Field-Control Comparison""ù experiment was conducted where soil from the East Bay, California was cultured with Bd strains from the same site. In the ""Methods Validation""ù experiment, artificial soil was used as the control and the same Bd strain was used. DNA was then extracted from these samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, which is a technique used to copy and amplify target sequences of DNA in real time. The method was found to accurately detect the presence of Bd in soil samples but was not sensitive enough to accurately identify the quantity of Bd. The researchers also found that the factors of storage duration, soil type and initial Bd dose did not significantly affect the presence of Bd. For future investigations, Koo and her team recommend that a greater range of initial dosage treatments should be done to gain insight on comparisons of Bd eDNA between field and artificial soil. This research could help develop accurate methods of detecting Bd eDNA in soil and a greater understanding of the spread of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.

science,Campus Point: New and exciting research from UCSB,18-May-23,9:00 AM,['Zelinda Strell'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-18/looking-back-from-campus-point/,"Living Tissue Dillon J. Cislo, a researcher in the UC Santa Barbara Physics Department, studies the orientational arrangement and the necessity of order in the development of organs. Cislo and his team have demonstrated how an orientationally ordered phase is first established and then maintained during the early stages of embryogenesis, the initial developmental stage of an embryo following fertilization, even when the cell multiplication process occurs. This research is derived from the process of morphogenesis, which is the development of body parts by so-called ""direct developers""ù ""î animals that are capable of assembling a miniature version of the adult body during the process of embryogenesis. Specifically, the researchers focused on understanding how order and orientation arrangement play an important role in morphogenesis. They thereby investigated how living systems, specifically those developing tissues, are able to generate and maintain order when cell divisions are present. There has been a lack of studies investigating the role of order and orientational arrangement in living tissues in the context of cell proliferation. This study addresses the interplay occurring between order, morphogenesis and thus cell proliferation within developing tissues. It fills the knowledge gap in understanding how non-equilibrium mechanisms in living systems are able to generate while maintaining the necessary order to specify the body plan. The study's methodology involved live imaging of transgenic Parhyale embryos, embryos that have been genetically modified to introduce foreign DNA using a custom-built microscope. The researchers then carried out processes of data analysis, cell tracking and quantitative analysis to study the developmental dynamics of the embryos. They concluded that the developmental dynamics of transgenic Parhyale embryos show characteristics of hydrodynamic components. For future studies, they highlighted the importance of enhanced imaging techniques and larger datasets. Better Batteries A recent study led by UC Berkeley researcher Juhyeon Ahn and contributed to by researchers in UCSB's Materials Department found that a disordered rock salt (DRX) cathode material that is rich in the element manganese undergoes major structural evolution, a process known as electrochemical cycling. This leads to the formation of plateau-like features in the voltage profile, which improves the battery's discharge capacity and energy density, meaning it can deliver a consistent quantity of energy over a longer period. This study began because of issues within the search for cathode materials that are able to address the limitation of conventional lithium-ion battery technologies. Researchers are interested in developing advanced lithium-ion batteries with increased performance levels and safety measures. This research advances the† field by providing an in-depth analysis of the structural evolution in manganese-rich DRX cathode materials. Additionally, it addresses gaps from previous research by providing insight into lithium-ion transport pathways, revealing reversible phase transformations and providing guidance for designing high-performing cathodes. DNA Gene Editing† Hannah Ghasemi, a researcher in the UCSB Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, has found that incorporating interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) into template DNA improves nonviral gene editing efficiency, thereby providing a crucial contribution to the field of gene editing. ICLS are defined by Ghasemi as ""substrates for the FA DNA repair pathway.""ù This research has implications for enhanced laboratory techniques, the development of remodeled strategies for treating diseases and a more nuanced understanding of DNA repair mechanisms. Previously, nonviral gene editing did not have high-efficiency rates, particularly in homology-directed repair (HDR) processes, a repair process occurring naturally in cells that can be harnessed within gene editing techniques. This study used a combination of molecular biology techniques, data analytics and gene editing workflows to investigate and establish the effects of incorporating ICLS into template DNA on nonviral gene editing outcomes. Findings were gathered through comparative analyses, providing important information in regard to enhancing homology direct repair efficiency, all the while keeping detailed tracking of the gene editing processes. The outcome of this paper shows that when crosslinks are combined with DNA molecules, there is an improvement of homology-directed repair, revealing a significant improvement in nonviral gene editing workflows. The researchers observed an increase in mediated gene editing when using template DNA molecules in comparison to uncrosslinked templates. This study provides important information to developing improved nonviral gene editing techniques, in addition to expanding the applications of HDR in laboratory settings and potential therapeutic interventions.

science,Simply Stated: What exactly is a superbloom?,18-May-23,9:00 AM,['Anushka Ghosh Dastidar'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-18/simply-stated-what-exactly-is-a-superbloom/,"You have to be living under a rock to have not noticed the sudden surge in greenery and flora throughout the state of California since around mid-February. Even if you haven't heard of it, you've definitely seen the effects of the superbloom around you. Whether you're driving up the 101 or making your way onto campus, masses of wildflowers have arisen all around! So what exactly is happening? A superbloom is a rare natural phenomenon known to predominantly occur in the desert regions of California and Arizona, and, occasionally, in the wetlands of South Africa. Superblooms are rare because there needs to be extremely precise weather conditions present in order for the botanical population to thrive. The right amount of rain must be present for the native flowers of California to be able to grow. The area must begin relatively dry to prevent the growth of certain types of invasive grasses. Bromes is one type of grass that, if left unchecked, can wreak havoc on ecosystems by sucking up the nutrients and space necessary for flowers to thrive. Too much rainfall early in the year will lead to an overgrowth of bromes and prevent flowers from surfacing. The majority of rainfall should happen during the season of autumn starting in October and be substantial enough to soak all the way into the soil. For the best growth, rains should last through April. This is the only way that the seeds of inactive flowers beneath the ground will have access to sufficient rainfall to grow. The exact right amount of water should reach the flowers in order to keep them from either flooding or becoming dehydrated, this typically means about 200% more rainfall than in an average year. Once the proper water conditions are secured, the flowers must have the right amount of cloud coverage to prevent them from baking under the sun. The final thing to ensure a superbloom is a lack of harsh winds. When wind speeds become too fast there runs a risk of flowers being blown away and uprooted. These specific conditions are only met on very limited occasions. After the droughts, fires and flash floods we find ourselves in the spring of 2023, with conditions ideal for another superbloom. Some of the most abundant flowers in California include purple sky lupines, Catalina mariposa lilies, pale yellow tidytips, Santa Ynez false lupines and of course the iconic California poppies. Superblooms only occur about once every ten years, with the number increasing in more recent years despite the ongoing drought experienced in California due to climate change. The last superbloom observed in California happened in 2019. Since then, the California climate has been steadily gearing up for the next one. If you find yourself with a free afternoon, be sure to check out the budding florals by visiting one of the many local viewpoints or hiking locations where the flowers can be viewed in their full form!† You'll find some of the best views at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve and Carrizo Plain National Monument.

science,Simply Stated: What‚'s the dirt on composting?,25-May-23,9:00 AM,['Maya Rink'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-25/simply-stated-whats-the-dirt-on-composting/,"As a generation that has been raised alongside the threats of the climate crisis, seemingly simple solutions have been sold to us our entire lives: drive electric vehicles to reduce emissions, cut down on meat consumption, use paper products instead of plastic ones, etc. However, in a world fueled by capital gain, these ""answers""ù are often presented in contradictory ways. Composting has been offered as a potential strategy, but is it a valid one?† Composting is the process by which organic matter is decomposed into a nutrient-rich soil. This practice acts as a valuable way to recycle materials that would otherwise go to the landfill like plant waste or food scraps. Why is this important? When food decomposes, it releases methane (CH4), one of the 10 primary greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.† Methane emissions call for increasing attention because of the way the gas interacts with our atmosphere. Methane only remains in our atmosphere for roughly a decade at a time, which is comparatively shorter than carbon dioxide (CO2), whose aggregations remain for thousands of years. However, atmospheric methane ultimately merges with oxygen (O2)† to create CO2. Methane also absorbs heat at a rate 200 times higher than CO2.† This is why methane's global warming potential is measured to be 84 times greater than CO2 on a 20-year timescale and 28 times greater on a 100-year timescale.† Composting combats this. This process prevents our waste from decomposing anaerobically, or without oxygen. An anaerobic environment, like the one created in landfills, fosters bacteria that feed on the waste and emit methane as a consequence. Instead, with composting, the waste is broken down methodically in a way that allows the nutrients to be reintroduced to the systems from which they came.† This has immense and lasting impacts. The robust and nutrient-rich soil that composting creates stimulates plant growth. Healthier and longer-lasting plants act as carbon sinks as well, actively absorbing the excess CO2 in the atmosphere. Compost also promotes overall soil health, which prevents erosion and influences a porous infiltration of water and an elevated water retention. This effectively reduces water use for farmers and gardeners, as well as aids in stormwater management. Composting can also lower the overall costs of growing plants by preventing plant replacement and reducing the need for irrigation.† These factors make both our farms and ecosystems more resilient to climate change in general. As weather shifts and the extremes become more common, it is vital that we have set up environments that are capable of enduring. With soil as our anchor, composting can be a lasting solution. One can begin their composting journey right here at UC Santa Barbara. There are many student-run programs in our community that make it easy! Associated Students' Department of Public Worms has compost bins throughout campus where one can drop off any food scraps or compostable products. Isla Vista Compost Collective manages drop-off bins at St. Michael's University Church and University United Methodist. They also host community workshops to help those interested in making their own compost get started! Associated Students Recycling also has created the Apartment Compost Initiative, a project aimed towards making composting accessible for those living in university housing.† So, the next time you go to throw away your food scraps, keep composting in mind!

science,Campus Point: New and exciting research from UCSB,25-May-23,9:00 AM,['Saanvi Tiwary'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-25/looking-back-from-campus-point-2/,"Statistical complexity of offline reinforcement language policy evaluation In a March 2023 study, Ming Yin, a doctoral student in UC Santa Barbara's Department of Computer Science and the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, investigates the challenges involved in evaluating policy without direct interaction with the environment. This technique, known as ""offline policy evaluation,""ù is particularly valuable when gathering new data is difficult or costly.† The focus of the research is on understanding the statistical complexity associated with estimating policy performance using historical data. Statistical complexity refers to the difficulty of obtaining accurate and unbiased estimates of policy performance from limited and potentially biased data.† Yin's study aims to address this issue by proposing methods that can provide reliable estimates of policy performance based solely on the available historical data. By exploring the theoretical aspects and developing practical techniques, the research contributes to the advancement of offline policy evaluation in tabular reinforcement learning, which is when a computer program learns how to make decisions by updating a table of values. It uses a table to remember the best actions to take, and the table keeps updating based off of trial and error runs that the computer will go through based on different scenarios.† The findings of this research has several real world implications, such as making decision making algorithms more informed and accurate by making them rely on carefully compiled historical trends and data. † Re-evaluating FDA-approved antibiotics for resistance levels A May 2023 research paper by Douglas Heithoff and Lucien Barnes, along with colleagues from various institutions, including UC Davis and The University of Sydney, highlight the importance of re-evaluating U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antibiotics in light of enhanced diagnostic accuracy for assessing antimicrobial resistance. The authors emphasize the need to revisit the effectiveness of antibiotics that have previously received approval from the FDA.† The authors propose a systematic and rigorous re-evaluation of FDA-approved antibiotics to improve treatment guidelines and guide the development of new antimicrobial therapies. Because distinguishing techniques have allowed for more precise assessments of antimicrobial resistance, a revaluation of the efficacy of these antibiotics is now necessary. The study implements improved diagnostic methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of the antimicrobial resistance patterns associated with FDA-approved antibiotics. Such a re-evaluation is crucial for identifying any limitations or deficiencies in the current arsenal of antibiotics, providing insights for future strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance. The paper stresses the importance of adapting to advancements in diagnostic accuracy to effectively address the evolving landscape of antimicrobial resistance. † Low-temperature gas-phase kinetics of ethanol In the article titled ""Low-Temperature Gas-Phase Kinetics of Ethanol-Methanol Heterodimer Formation,""ù authors Lincoln Satterthwaite, Greta Koumarianou and various other researches from UCSB and Harvard investigate the kinetics of heterodimer formation between ethanol and methanol at low temperatures in the gas phase.† The study focuses on understanding the process and rates of the formation of heterodimers, which are molecular complexes composed of two different molecules: ethanol and methanol. The authors specifically explore this process at low temperatures, which is important for various applications, such as atmospheric chemistry and astrophysics. Through experimental techniques and analyses, the authors determine the rate constants and reaction mechanisms governing the formation of ethanol-methanol heterodimers.† The findings shed light on the fundamental understanding of intermolecular interactions and provide insights into the dynamics of complex formation in low-temperature gas-phase environments.† This study contributes to the broader field of physical chemistry, enabling more accurate modeling and predictions of complex formation in various scientific disciplines.†

science,Research in Review:,1-Jun-23,9:00 AM,['Science Editor'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-01/research-in-review-2/,"Looking back on the most notable scientific accomplishments and breakthroughs made by UCSB researchers during the 2022-23 year. † SIMONE MANSELL / DAILY NEXUS Modern love By: Samarah Paulino Much research has been done on the premise of love. However, little has been explored regarding how cultural influences may affect an individual's love experiences. A study by Piotr Sorokowski from the University of Wroclaw, Poland, along with fellow researcher Daniel Conroy-Beam, a psychological & brain sciences professor from UC Santa Barbara, attempts to fill in this gray area by looking at intimacy, passion and commitment patterns across countries in relation to varying modernization indexes. Surveys across 45 different countries found positive correlations between modernization and levels of how intimate, passionate and committed couples were ""î what the authors described as ""love levels.""ù Countries with higher levels of modernization had higher love levels compared to countries with more traditional cultures. However, a drop was noticed for countries with the highest levels of modernization, possibly describing a point in development at which the effects of love may become or seem less beneficial. A correlation was also noticed with regard to collectivism, the nature of putting one's society before themselves: the researchers found that countries with higher levels of collectivism also produced higher levels of intimacy and commitment. This suggests the idea that individuals with collectivist values more highly prioritize connectivity and relational bonds within romantic relationships. Although no definite conclusion can be drawn, this study proposes the idea that differences in cultures can affect one's attitude towards love and how modernization and collectivism may be significant factors. † Mental health mindfulness By: Kaitlin Lee Latinx youth are the fastest growing ethnic group, yet mental health among this community has been little studied. UCSB researchers from the Department of Clinical, Counseling & School Psychology, including Alissa Der Sarkissian, Jill Sharkey and Alison Cerezo investigated mental health in Latinx youth and the physical symptoms, termed ""somatic complaints,""ù that mental illness causes. Somatic complaints are physical symptoms of mental illness such as stomach aches and headaches. An individual might bring excessive attention to these sensations, worsening their symptoms and mental health in the process. The study used hierarchical linear regressions to model somatic complaints and the environmental stressors that contribute to them. The researchers found the most affected groups to be females and third-generation immigrants. It also showed that youth were less likely to have somatic complaints if a relationship with a supportive adult was established. The study emphasized the importance of considering factors and demographics such as mental health stigma, acculturation, immigration status and gender when studying mental health. SIMONE MANSELL / DAILY NEXUS Food footprints By: Roshan Mishra Mainstream media attention regarding climate change usually focuses on the pollution by the fossil fuel industry, explaining how, among other things, they break down the ozone layer and contribute to global warming. However, an often overlooked aspect of environmental change is how food production for certain countries has played a part in this. Whether it be through the overfishing of marine habitats or land-based factory farming, political and social efforts to remedy the rampant effects of climate change have usually turned a blind eye to† the immense effects of food production. More alarmingly, just five nations have been responsible for over half of the cumulative global food footprint, a discovery made by UCSB's very own National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine biology. It's likely that less action and attention have been granted to this aspect of climate change because of how vital food production is to humanity's survival on this planet. Nevertheless, even if sudden changes in our food production might now seem to be disruptive to our short-term lifestyles, solutions in the form of sustainable agriculture and overall food production are crucial to our long-term survival on this planet.† † A new antibiotic Maya Rink This February, researcher for UCSB's Department of Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology Douglas Heithoff and his team recognized COE2-2 hexyl, a compound that demonstrated broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. This compound is unique to other antibiotics, as it did not trigger the microbial bacterial resistance during testing that typically occurs. This means that this antibiotic could be transformative to the world of bacterial infection treatment, as it offers a solution without negatively affecting other elements of patients's immune systems. COE2-2 hexyl offers many other advantages as well, from demonstrated safety in testing to simplicity and affordability. Heithoff and his team are currently working diligently to introduce this groundbreaking discovery to modern medicine.†† † Coral bleaching: 
Saanvi Tiwary† SIMONE MANSELL / DAILY NEXUS Coral reef resilience is difficult to study due to coral's extensive life span and long recovery rate. However, UCSB doctoral candidate Kai Kopecky has developed a way to investigate the dynamics of reefs following disturbance events. Coral bleaching, triggered by high temperatures, results in the expulsion of symbiotic colorful algae and leaves the coral vulnerable, while tropical storms often cause the complete removal of coral structures from the reef. The researchers observed a significant bleaching event in the long-studied coral reef ecosystem of Mo'orea in French Polynesia, where past studies have revealed that the reef alternates between coral and macroalgae ""î like seaweed ""î dominance. Kopecky created a mathematical model to quantify the effects of reef disturbances that incorporated variables such as live and dead coral, exposed and protected algae and empty areas with potential for colonization by either coral or macroalgae. The model also considered factors like coral and algae growth rates, coral mortality and erosion rates and algae overgrowth rate. Kopecky's study demonstrated that these events, like bleaching and tropical storms, and specifically the coral skeletons which remain ""î termed ""material legacies,""ù ""î can in fact hinder coral recovery. The skeletons provide protection for algae against herbivores, which can lead to the ecosystem becoming algae-dominant and has the potential to affect reef resilience and cause more coral to die. Future studies may provide insight into the broader implications of disturbances and their lasting effects on various ecological systems. † Little Lasers
By: Olivia Gil de Bernabe Lasers with linewidth frequencies below 10 MHz (10000000†cycles/second) are critical to many scientific fields, from metrology, the study of measurement,†to†quantum physics and the manipulation of fundamental matter. In October†of†2022, UC†Santa Barbara†researchers from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering published a paper demonstrating the viability of a compact integrated laser system they developed with researchers from other institutions. The new lasers, which are narrow-linewidth†and frequency-stable, outperform traditional fiber lasers, whose costly materials, bulk, and inadequate noise reduction render them limited in application. Key to the new laser system†are†a vacuum-gap cavity and microfabricated mirrors that hold the lasers together, allowing for ""extraordinarily low""ù noise. These new lasers meets the size, integration and performance demands of exciting advances in high-precision GPS-free positioning and commercial 5G communications.

Jain, whose work specifically focuses on India's agricultural practices and production has examined agricultural decisions made across India using remote sensing, geospatial analyses and census datasets. This methodology led to finding a conclusive relationship between climate change, groundwater depletion and agricultural productivity. Exploring the impacts of groundwater depletion on agricultural output, possible adaptive strategies to alleviate stress on groundwater resources and the relation to groundwater, Jain's overarching message is that groundwater depletion is quickly becoming a critical issue as temperatures continue to rise: the stakes can be observed from India's current crop yield, and based on Jain's research, canal irrigation is only a temporary solution for a global issue.† † Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio By: Emma Holm-Olsen ""Feelings are the ambassadors of the state of life in your organism""ù ""ì Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio On April 17, leading neuroscientist and University of Southern California professor Ant√≥nio Dam√°sio spoke to a crowd of UC Santa Barbara students and staff as part of UCSB's Center for Portuguese Studies's speaker series ""Celebrating the Carnation Revolution: A Conference in Honor of Eduardo Louren√ßo.""ù The topic of the talk was consciousness ""î more specifically, the physical and psychological origins of consciousness and why Dam√°sio believes our feelings should get more credit. He asserts that feeling, much more so than reason or logic, is the true origin of consciousness. ""Feelings are the ambassadors of the state of life in your organism,""ù Dam√°sio said. According to him, consciousness is also what subsequently allows us to effectively and coherently express our individual experiences to our peers. He argues that without feeling and consciousness, communication, specifically our use of language and literature, is meaningless. Indeed, our ability to experience feelings and emotions, process them and then turn them into decisive thoughts and actions is one of the defining characteristics of our species.† † URCA highlights By: Emma Holm-Olsen From May 8-12, undergraduate students shared research and creative projects with the public at the† Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URCA) Week. The event included activities such as poster colloquiums, conference panels, and the ""Slam,""ù wherein participants competed for cash prizes with micro-presentations on their research. A few research projects stood out, such as first-year biology and English double major Kathleen Zhang's. Zhang and her lab advisors study a phenomenon known as ""trogocytosis,""ù the nibbling of pathogenic cells by our immune system's macrophage cells. They examined whether our immune responses could be manipulated to make trogocytosis more lethal to cancer cells in particular, carrying significant implications for improved cancer treatments. Second-year biology major Riya Nilkant's research also caught our eye. Along with principal investigators Kenneth Kosik and Soojin Yi of the Kosik Lab, she's studying the newly discovered PSD-95 protein, a scaffolding protein in our neuronal synapses. Aside from being the first to quantify the organization of atoms in the binding site of the PSD-95 protein, the researchers are investigating how the protein works by inserting fluorescently tagged versions of it into neural cells. The study may also lead to a better understanding of conditions such as Alzheimer's and autism. Lastly, fourth-year ecology & evolution major Kathryn Koo studies the pathogenic fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) to quantify its spread and deadly effects on amphibian species. Koo and her colleagues at the Cherie Briggs Lab ran experiments to determine how Bd can be detected using environmental DNA samples (eDNA) and whether various elements of eDNA storage and degradation affect its detection in soil samples.† † Cynthia Kenyon By: Meenakshi Manoj ""The hope is that if we can increase youthfulness, we can postpone age-related diseases""ù ""ì Cynthia Kenyon† Cynthia Kenyon, vice president of aging research at Calico Life Sciences and director of the Larry L. Hillblom Center for the Biology of Aging at the University of California, San Francisco, lectured at Corwin Pavilion this past quarter as part of the ""Aging in America'""ù series, hosted by the College of Letters & Science at UCSB. Her research focus on evolutionary and molecular processes contributing to longevity began with the observation that the impact of chromosomes on the spatial organization of the body in the development of C. elegans. She introduced the concept of regulatory genes after finding that inserting regulatory genes from C. elegans, a type of nematode, into D. melanogaster ""î commonly known as the fruit fly ""î resulted in various physical abnormalities. In her lecture, Kenyon highlighted the plasticity of aging and the role of evolution in shaping characteristics and average lifespans. Kenyon discovered that a set of mutated worms in one experiment that had a less efficient Daf-2 gene, a precursor to the hormone receptor analogous to insulin in humans, appeared physically younger compared to their normal counterparts. Kenyon and her colleagues found that worms had hidden life extension potential triggered by a single base pair mutation. The presentation also touched upon heterochronic genes, DNA variations affecting size and longevity and protein aggregation and aging in humans. Finding that age-related diseases in worms, flies and mice are ameliorated due to this mutation opens up the possibility for health longevity in humans.

science,Simply Stated: What is June Gloom?,27-Jun-23,8:00 AM,['Roshan Mishra'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-06-27/simply-stated-what-is-june-gloom/,"†""June Gloom,""ù the annual weather phenomena currently affecting California, is characterized by a rolling fog that brings with it occasional rain and constant cloudy days. While it's certainly not the most aesthetically pleasing time of year (according to some Santa Barbarans and tourists), it is a completely normal occurrence affecting coastal regions around the world, including Central California, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the Inland Empire.† June Gloom takes place when colder wind currents from the ocean come into contact with our usual warmer coastal air. The combination of these elements creates a cooling effect that allows for the formation of fog and clouds, which proceed to overtake the skies and provide that ""gloomy""ù effect which gives this season its name.† June Gloom's veracity can usually be determined by the prevailing meteorological pattern of the year. Ocean temperatures off the Californian coast are characterized by El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a events. El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a are climate patterns that induce warmer or cooler temperatures in the oceans, which then affect the temperature of mainland weather.
 During El Ni√±o years, locals can expect less gray days and June Gloom's already brief tenure to be even shorter. However, given La Ni√±a's cooler nature, locals and visitors to Santa Barbara can expect more cloudy days dominating May and June. Despite the season's poor reputation among locals, it provides a crucial period of cooling within the Californian coastal regions, which are otherwise sunny year-round. 

Furthermore, local ecosystems benefit greatly from June Gloom's moisture, providing a much-needed relief which allows local plant life to survive and thrive. Despite complaints regarding June Gloom's seasonal ""unattractiveness,""ù certain photographers find an uncanny, ethereal beauty generated from the rolling fog's physical obscuring of flora and the cloudy skies above.† This gloomy season lacks longevity, however, with marine layers of cool fog dissipating when the afternoon rolls around. Indeed, June Gloom, as its name implies, usually never lasts long beyond its namesake month. 

Perhaps most interesting is how June Gloom seems to affect the moods of certain individuals. Given that most Californians are used to bright weather patterns year-round, they are often taken by surprise when the fog settles in and begin exhibiting symptoms of stress, low energy, difficulty concentrating and more.† To combat these byproducts of June Gloom, individuals could take part in more indoor activities or schedule outings with others to reduce possibilities of social isolation during this time. Unfortunately, June Gloom also occurs right during final exam season and the start of summer. Precautions for those with seasonal depression issues should be taken so that the temporary gloom doesn't get the better of you.† Curiously, this year's June Gloom appears to be more severe than previous years. The San Diego International Airport will log over 20 cloudy days as opposed to their average of 11, with a similar statistic also present at Los Angeles International Airport.† The exact reasons for this remain a mystery that meteorologists are attempting to discern; their best hypothesis is that colder oceanic air is ""stalling""ù over California. However, the June Gloom will dissipate by the end of the month or early July, bringing with it the standard summer weather California is known for, albeit later than expected.† Despite its uncharacteristic appearance in a sunny state, the June Gloom phenomenon brings with it a variety of benefits to local ecosystems and atmospheric conditions Southern California doesn't typically enjoy. As long as you can manage the possible seasonal depressive disorders that might generate around this time, you'll enjoy or, at the very least, easily get through this atypical time of year. Maybe the June Gloom isn't so gloomy after all!

science,UCSB professor receives NIH Director‚'s New Innovator Award,7-Jul-23,4:14 PM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-07/ucsb-professor-receives-nih-directors-new-innovator-award/,"Michael Beyeler, the director of UC Santa Barbara's Bionic Vision Lab and assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, was one of 103 people awarded the prestigious National Institutes of Health Director's New Innovator Award in October 2022. He was awarded the grant for his project ""Towards a Smart Bionic Eye: AI-Powered Artificial Vision for the Treatment of Incurable Blindness.""ù Visual impairment affects nearly 20 million Americans and is one of the most prevalent disabilities worldwide. While some forms of visual impairment can be treated, many of the more serious forms, unfortunately, have no cure. In these cases, an electronic visual prosthesis may be the best and sometimes the only option. These ""bionic eyes""ù are implanted directly into the patient's eye or brain and can use electrical currents to stimulate their visual system's surviving brain cells.† However, despite patients reporting being able to see flashes of light when using these bionic eyes, often the most that can be seen with current artificial visual technology are blurry, black-and-white shapes.† Beyeler and his team, however, are working to improve upon the existing technology in new, innovative ways. The five-year, $1.5 million grant will enable Beyeler and his colleagues to research and answer the fundamental questions which could eventually make possible the development of a ""smart bionic eye.""ù The eye, building upon current visual aid technology, would utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to identify potential obstacles and landmarks in order to better facilitate day-to-day movement for visually impaired users.† ""These devices can improve everyday life [and] can provide people with the visual cues that they need to perform their daily activities,""ù Beyeler said regarding the implications of this device. ""Instead of focusing on one day restoring ""ònatural' vision, which is a noble but perhaps close-to-impossible task, we might be better off thinking about how to create ""òpractical' and ""òuseful' artificial vision now.""ù And this is exactly what he and his team are trying to do.† The ""smart""ù in Beyeler's ""smart bionic eye""ù comes from the use of AI and computer vision. ""The idea is that if ""¶ say, you are trying to cross the street or go from A to B, the things that might be important for this task is to know where the obstacles nearby are, where the landmarks are that I need to walk to, and computer vision can help you with that,""ù Beyeler said.† He emphasized that this potential technology would be more like an AI-powered visual aid instead of a replacement for natural sight.† ""Rather than aiming to represent the visual scene as faithfully as possible, we propose to focus on functionality instead. What is it you're trying to do, and which visual cues might help you accomplish that?""ù Beyeler said. ""For example, we can use computer vision to segment objects of interest from background clutter or detect structural edges of indoor environments to give users a sense of where they are in a room.""ù† Design concept for the ""Smart Bionic Eye.""ù Courtesy of Michael Beyeler, UCSB Bionic Vision Lab The research team is currently collaborating with a number of groups worldwide, including those that work with patients using Argus II, the once most commonly available, but discontinued, retinal implant. They have also been in contact with a team in Spain that is developing an implant that could be inserted directly into the visual cortex.† Beyeler's work will build upon past and existing technologies, without which this work could not be done. However, his proposed bionic eye is unique. † ""What really sets this work apart from other projects is the use of computer vision and AI to support everyday tasks ""î which might make the difference between abandoned technology and a widely adopted, next-generation neuroprosthetic device,""ù he said. Beyeler said that the first step involved in this project was to speak with local visually impaired residents, namely via the Braille Institute Santa Barbara Center, about how they generally navigate crowded or complex environments, as well as what is most important for them and what they might be missing with regard to the identification and avoidance of obstacles.† Involving people with visual imparities is crucial to Beyeler and his project, despite the field of biotechnology having a poor track record when it comes to including ""end-users.""ù He said that when those who will ultimately be benefitting from the technology are not involved in the process at every stage, there is a much higher chance that the product will not be adopted by the community in the long term, be it because people are opposed to the particular form, or simply because the product solves a problem that was not really there to begin with.†† In addition to his assistant professor position in the computer science department, Beyeler holds a joint appointment with the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, and is the associate director of the UCSB Center for Virtual Environments and Behavior (ReCVEB), which aims to provide a space to develop new ways of using virtual reality with applications in the field of psychology.† The team, through ReCVEB, has developed a virtual reality simulation of what it might look like to have a bionic eye. ""This way, sighted participants, often our own students, recruited through the psych department, have the opportunity to experience some of our proposed visual augmentation strategies while performing simple wayfinding tasks in immersive virtual reality,""ù Beyeler said.†† Once the researchers have tested out various strategies, they can choose the best ones and have people with visual disabilities try the simulation to see what works and what doesn't. ""It has long been important to me that my research has a translational, real-world impact. The potential of being involved in the restoration of sight is an easy motivator ""î both for me and my students,""ù Beyeler said.† If you are a student at UCSB and are interested in this research, the team is always looking for volunteers for their virtual reality studies. You do not need to be visually impaired to take part, and the team welcomes people of all backgrounds. If you would like to get involved as a researcher, check out their website where they advertise open positions for research assistantships and honors or master's projects.† I'am making over $15k a month working online.

science,"FDA makes history, approves Elevidys to treat pediatric Duchenne muscular dystrophy",11-Jul-23,11:29 AM,['Meenakshi Manoj'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-11/curing-the-incurable-fda-makes-history-approves-elevidys-to-treat-pediatric-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/,"† The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Elevidys in June, making it the first gene therapy designed to halt the progression of pediatric Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a life-threatening genetic disorder of progressive muscular weakness. The gene therapy involves the stimulation of a microdystrophin gene, which produces a shortened form of dystrophin, about one-third the size. Microdystrophin delivery is then targeted to muscle cells using vectors or adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Elevidys will be available to patients ages four to five years, assuming they have no medical complications towards this therapy. An example of a complication that would prevent a patient from being a candidate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene therapy is if the patient has developed antibodies to the AAV that is used for microdystrophin delivery. The patient's immune system may respond to the AAV in a way that neutralizes the therapeutic gene's effect on the body. Elevidys is not a cure and cannot restore lost muscle function, however, until now there was no treatment to even slow the progression of DMD, which affects one in 3,500 males worldwide. The gene therapy, developed and manufactured by Sarepta Therapeutics, targets the underlying cause of DMD, which makes it unlike previous treatment methods for the disorder. First identified in the late 19th century, DMD results from mutations in the dystrophin gene which is located on the X chromosome. Because males only have one X chromosome that can be expressed while either of two X chromosomes can be expressed in females, DMD more commonly affects males, while females may be carriers or mildly affected. In the United States, all forms of muscular dystrophy affects an estimated 250,000 individuals in the United States. The signs and symptoms generally onset between ages three to five. There are several symptoms associated with DMD, including greater susceptibility to falls, a gait, limitations with physical activities such as running and learning disabilities. To date, there is no cure for the disorder, but the symptoms can be controlled with physical therapy, the use of assistive devices such as wheelchairs and medication. Corticosteroid drugs like prednisone and deflazacort, also known as anti-inflammatory medications or steroids, have been used to treat patients with DMD. These drugs only slow the progression of muscle weakness in affected individuals and delay the need to walk with assistance by two to three years. The dystrophin gene mutation that causes DMD results in patients lacking the protein responsible for keeping muscle cells intact. The main consequence of a dystrophin deficiency is muscle damage every time the individual contracts their muscles. This not only affects skeletal and smooth muscle but also cardiac muscle which is responsible for controlling the heart. Neurologist Jerry Mendell at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio had seen his first patient with DMD over 50 years prior. Mendell, who is also the principal investigator at the†Center for Gene Therapy, led the Phase I study of a systemic gene therapy for DMD. ""This is what I've devoted my life to ""¶ The [Food and Drug Administration] FDA's decision means we can save more function and save the quality of life for these children and their families,""ù†Dr. Mendell said. Although the FDA has approved the pediatric gene therapy, clinical trials will continue to be conducted until the fall of 2023 to determine the therapy's effectiveness in†interrupting the progression of DMD.†Following the initial completion of Sarepta Therapeutics' Phase 3 EMBARK trial, the goal is to†expand the scope of†Elevidys gene therapy to treat patients with milder DMD symptoms, regardless of age. In addition, Sarepta plans to initiate clinical trials with Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche for DMD treatment in males as young as 6 months old. If the trials are successful, the gene therapy's scope could be expanded to include the administration of the gene therapy in infants, before the onset of muscle damage. CORRECTION [7/17/23, 10:00 a.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Pfizer, Genethon, and Solid Biosciences aided in the production of the therapy alongside Sarepta Therapeutics. This article has been corrected to reflect that Sarepta alone is responsible for development and manufacturing, and retains exclusive rights to the therapy in the United States.

science,Simply Stated: What are the positive effects of animals on human mental health?,18-Jul-23,1:46 PM,['Roshan Mishra'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-18/simply-stated-what-are-the-positive-effects-of-animals-on-human-mental-health/,"During a time when mental health crises are statistically growing across the country, it's always reassuring to have a source of unconditional love and comfort in one's life. For many, these things come in the form of pets, often of the canine or feline variation. If you're on the fence about owning one yourself, perhaps this article will convince you to think about adopting a furry friend. While a pet certainly involves a commitment of time and finances, it could be a significant benefit in the long run!† Our two and four-footed comrades boast a proven ability to make us humans feel better. Through interactions with our dogs, cats and what have you, our cortisol levels, the hormone which essentially regulates our feelings of stress, decrease, along with lower blood pressure. Per the comforting and supportive nature of domesticated pets and their abilities to sense our unease and unhappiness, they're able to navigate us through some of the tougher times in our lives. By providing this animal with loving support and care, you can probably expect a similar return, creating a mutually beneficial and loving relationship, not unlike a familial or friendly bond between humans. Schools even integrate them in official exam stress reduction programs, alongside serving the elderly in retirement homes.† It's not difficult to find practical applications for pets in society today. Therapy animals are common, especially for those with mental or physical vulnerabilities, and are trained to not only interact patiently with their owner but with other humans as well. Dogs are the most popular therapy animal, given their increased openness to interact with strangers and greater ability to communicate with humans more than most other animals. Even discounting these advantages, animals can provide a sense of security in your home. Studies confirm that any dog, no matter its size or breed, can ward off prospective intruders.† However, the adage of our parents, whenever our young selves clamored for a pet, remains true: ""Only if you can take care of it.""ù Animal abuse, and in extreme cases, cruelty, remains a problem throughout the United States. Shelters are constantly overwhelmed with new entries, and pets are often left abandoned on the porches of neighbors and sides of highways and streets after the owner(s) realize they are ill-equipped to care for the animal. These incidents are heartbreaking, as it displays a betrayal of the innate trust that animals place in humans. Survivors of this abandonment usually experience reclusiveness, alongside a distancing from humans and return to shelters.† Feelings of isolation and loneliness are common among young people today, but pets can provide an effective deterrent, as they encourage exercise by demanding walks or playing with them. In turn, they remain attentive to your emotional needs should you reciprocate their kindness and love, even by simply just being another living presence in the home. Dogs, cats and all manner of pets are clinically proven as deterrents against depression, isolationist feelings and low self-esteem issues.  Ultimately, should one be adequately prepared and ready for such a task, taking care of a pet could change your life for the better. With academically proven results of mental and physical health benefits, adopting the ranks of man's best friend could very well be the improvement your life might need!

science,Campus Point: New and exciting research from UCSB,31-Jul-23,1:30 PM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-31/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-from-ucsb/,"Combatting carbon: With carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions continuing to rise, it is more important than ever to find strategies to dampen the effects that carbon is having on our atmosphere, oceans and living organisms, including creating innovative ways to remove and/or sequester the carbon we are putting into the world. Researchers from UC Santa Barbara's Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology are attempting to do just that by studying how phytoplankton respond to a potential marine alkalinization treatment. The treatment would consist of artificially increasing the ocean's pH in order to combat the effects of ocean acidification, a process by which carbon reacts with water to produce carbonic acid (H2CO3), which then breaks into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). As acidification becomes more widespread, the proliferating H+ ions can react with carbonate ions (CO32-), which when prolonged can have drastic impacts on marine life, particularly those species which rely on the carbonate ions to produce their shells.† Essentially, the UCSB researchers' idea is to add a sort of ""òantacid' to the ocean, a mixture that would convert CO2 into other, less harmful carbon compounds. Doctoral student James Gately, the lead author on the team's recent paper in ScienceAdvances, says that their goal is to simply speed up a naturally occurring geologic process; when the ocean's acidity is lowered, its capacity to store more carbon increases. The study consisted of observing the physiological and ecological effects of an alkaline treatment on two ""òphytoplankton functional group representatives,' Emiliania huxleyi and Chaetoceros. Both of these species move great amounts of compounds like carbonate and silica through the ecosystem as they construct their exoskeletons. Therefore, the loss of or decreased functionality of either species could spell disaster for the ecosystem as a whole. The researchers, however, found that when both E. huxleyi and Chaetoceros were exposed to amounts of CO2 mimicking current levels, combined with the alkaline treatment, neither were significantly affected. While future studies of potential impacts on other marine organisms are necessary, this study has shown that alkalinization treatments are a promising, if short-term, carbon-dioxide removal strategy. Susceptible seas: Researchers at UC Santa Barbara's National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS), along with colleagues from UCSB's Bren School for Environmental Science, UC Santa Cruz's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, among others, have recently published their findings from a study conducted on the effects of marine heatwaves on ecological communities, both within and outside of marine protected areas (MPAs). The study, co-led by UCSB's Joshua Smith, Jennifer Caselle, and Kerry Nickols, was part of a 10-year project dedicated to monitoring California's MPA network, and happened to span the deadly heat wave of 2014-2016, the largest marine heatwave on record to date. The team's efforts focused on rocky intertidal, reef and kelp forest habitats, and consisted of performing species counts and measurements of the proportional cover of invertebrates and macroalgae in order to quantify remaining biomass, and thus the extent of the heat wave's damage. They ultimately found that, with the exception of the rocky intertidal zones, there is no significant difference in community susceptibility to heat stress between areas protected from fishing and those which are not. While this news is without doubt disheartening, it will continue to be crucial to protect and maintain MPAs for other reasons, including the ability to monitor how marine communities react to heat waves in the long term and to discern whether MPAs may facilitate recovery, as well as to continue to be able to study the effects of climate change without the presence of fishing or other human interference.† Tuna trouble: A recent paper by lead-author Diva Amon of UC Santa Barbara's Marine Science Institute and colleagues discusses the recent finding that with the escalating effects of climate change, the distribution of multiple tuna species will shift significantly, ultimately leading to overlap with areas currently designated for deep-sea mining. Approximately two thirds of Earth's oceans are considered to be the ""high seas,""ù or areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), with ABNJ resources, both living and nonliving, being under the control of the International Seabed Authority (ISA). The ISA is an intergovernmental agency responsible for both the governance of any activities relating to minerals, as well as the regulation of the protection and management of ABNJ fisheries resources. Additionally, the implementation of rules regarding fisheries, particularly those of ""economically-important highly-migratory fish stocks""ù is primarily the responsibility of regional fisheries management organizations. The paper highlights the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a large marine area near Hawaii, in the eastern Pacific. The CCZ hosts an impressive amount of biodiversity, due to several abiotic factors such as high oxygen concentrations and mineral deposits, which make it a choice habitat for many fish species, including many species of tuna.† However, the CCZ is also particularly attractive to deep-sea mining companies, which aim to extract ""polymetallic nodules""ù from the sea floor in order to use them in the production of iron and steel, among other things. In the near future, rising marine temperatures will drive shifts in distribution of the fish leading to increased overlap between the fisheries and mining zones. Deep-sea mining in the CCZ is currently only in the exploration phase, but if it is permitted to transition into the exploitation phase, it could have significant environmental consequences, including harmful plumes of sediment and increased concentrations of metals in the water column. Current issues of monitoring and controlling the CCZ include gaps in scientific knowledge, the remoteness of the site and multi-sectoral governance resulting in the inability to have a unified approach to conservation and management. It is clear that more research is needed on the environmental aspects of the spatial overlap between deep-sea mining and fisheries, but the paper's authors also advocate for changes in mining regulation in order to ensure the sustainable co-existence of all stakeholders.

science,"Simply Stated: Why does time ‚""fly‚""ù when we‚'re having fun?",2-Aug-23,9:35 AM,['Olivia Gil de Bernabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-02/simply-stated-why-does-time-fly-when-were-having-fun/,"Time seems to escape us all. Though age-old mechanisms such as the calendar and clock help us organize it in our three-dimensional reality, our internalized experience of its passage can vary wildly. Why is it that time can slow down to a sluggish pace but also fly by, especially when we're having fun? These questions have guided scientists in time perception studies.† Unlike our other senses, no one organ is dedicated to the sole task of perceiving time. Rather, scientists have identified that multiple areas of the brain work together to execute and regulate time perception. The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and basal ganglia ""î all of which perform other functions as well ""î have been found to activate in studies involving temporal discrimination tasks. While the question of where in the brain is generally accepted, the question of how time perception occurs on a neuronal level is not understood.† However, in recent years, many empirical studies that have explored the broad process of time perception have found that it is intrinsically linked to subjective sensations. Physiological changes, such as increases in levels of anxiety or chronic pain, facilitate bodily time measurement. The underlying explanatory theory is that bodily changes bring attention to the fact that the present self feels different than it did in preceding moments. The awareness that a state change has occurred, brought about by visceral signals in the insular cortex ""î a lobe of the cerebral cortex dedicated to multimodal sensory processing and other homeostasis-regulatory functions ""î propagates the understanding that time passage has occurred. Memory, then, is crucial to the perception of time, as it marks how different bodily states correspond to moments along time's continuous trajectory from past to present and into the future. Like physiological sensations, emotions are linked to time perception and have been found to affect the degree of perception of time and aid in memory storage, helping to explain why the sensation of time can vary based on mood. When it comes to temporal perception as a function of memory storage, stronger emotions produce high arousal levels, leading us to greater bodily awareness and a degree of attention placed on the experience. The experience is therefore highlighted in time, causing it to be stored ""higher""ù in the working memory roster.  KATYA KISELEVA / DAILY NEXUS Regarding the perception of time passage varying with mood state, scientists have investigated the process in task completion experiments that linked proneness to boredom to the perception of time passage. Attendance to the task at hand was crucial, as it was found that individuals struggling with tasks took longer to complete them, with the realization that it took longer than expected to complete causing them to feel bored. In these studies, individuals experiencing high levels of boredom with the task at hand were found to be worse at estimating time, while individuals with low levels of boredom tended to underestimate the passage of time. If you are engaged well with a task, your high attention and lack of boredom means you are not constantly engaged with visceral discomfort. So, when you're enjoying yourself and having fun, time feels as though it's ""flying""ù because attention is shed on the task, not on the self.

science,Simply Stated: What is an algal bloom and what does it mean for marine life?,4-Aug-23,12:52 PM,['Nicolas Liu'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-04/simply-stated-what-is-an-algal-bloom-and-what-does-it-mean-for-marine-life/,"Algae is a fundamental contributor to ecosystems across the world; it sustains food webs in all aquatic environments in which it is found, and around 70% of atmospheric oxygen can be attributed to photosynthesizing algae. Still, there are key properties of algae that can prove dangerous when it is present in excess, and they can threaten to reverse the same benefits to ocean life that they usually provide.† Santa Barbara County has experienced a series of harmful algal blooms increasing in frequency and intensity over recent years, culminating to be the most critical this summer for ocean life.† Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are the result of the explosive growth of phytoplankton, or microalgae. Two types of phytoplankton ""î dinoflagellates and diatoms ""î are responsible for most of the algal blooms that are ecologically and environmentally harmful when they are allowed to accumulate to certain levels. These blooms cause the ocean surface to adopt a red color, which has given the saltwater blooms the name ""red tides.""ù HABs' threat to ocean life derives from the algal emission of the neurotoxin domoic acid. When ingested, this compound primarily targets the hippocampus in the brain, inhibiting long-term memory and spatial navigation. Direct consumption of algae-producing domoic acid by filter feeders is generally inconsequential, as the level of toxin intake is too low to incur any danger.† However, greater consumption of filter feeders by large organisms such as sea lions and dolphins can result in detrimental bioaccumulation, ultimately leading to domoic acid poisoning. The intensity of poisoning increases with the amount consumed, ranging in consequence from nausea and lethargy to seizures, paralysis and death. In humans, poisoning is most often attributed to shellfish consumption and results in similar concentration-based symptoms. Regional organizations, such as the Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute (CIMWI), have been engaging in record numbers of domoic acid-related rehabilitations since the bloom's emergence in June. ""The highest number of patients CIMWI has ever had in care at one time is 60,""ù a CIMWI Instagram post from July stated. ""That was in 2019 when we rescued a total of 182 seals and sea lions. In only 6 months of this year, we have already rescued 172!""ù The California coastline has experienced HABs for decades, but worsening environmental conditions have resulted in increasingly dire consequences for more recent blooms. ""Climate change and rise of nutrient pollution are environmental circumstances that are potentially causing HABs to occur more often and in locations not previously affected,""ù CIMWI's website stated. Particularly noteworthy in the 2023 algal bloom is its increased concentration farther offshore from the California shoreline, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said. This primarily affects the species of ocean life impacted most by domoic acid poisoning, as increased numbers of dolphins have joined the large number of sea lions that normally constitute the annual casualties.† Current research into the causes of algal blooms finds that warmer temperatures characterizing the summer season lead to increased water temperature which is beneficial to HABs. However, the extent of individual factors working in tandem to generate blooms is still being determined. ""While we know of many factors that may contribute to HABs, how these factors come together to create a bloom of algae is not well understood,""ù the NOAA said in an article on why harmful algal blooms occur. One widely agreed upon contributor to HABs perpetuation is nutrient pollution, in which fertilizer, sewage and industrial runoff from the mainland flow into the ocean, increasing nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Microalgae benefit from these chemicals that they use as fertilizer, resulting in bursts of accelerated algal growth. Other factors under consideration include water circulation and extreme weather events. As summer begins to wind down, it is hoped that this year's HABs will subside with minimal additional losses to marine life in the Santa Barbara area, as well as relief for conservation organizations, including the CIMWI.† Research towards mitigation of HABs is forthcoming and especially necessary as global climates exacerbate. The NOAA is at the forefront of these efforts: ""NOAA scientists continue to monitor and study HABs to determine how to detect and forecast the location of the blooms,""ù according to NOAA's website. ""The goal is to give coastal communities advance warning, so they can adequately plan and deal with the adverse environmental and health effects associated with a harmful bloom.""ù

science,Simply Stated: Is my phone damaging my eyes?,11-Aug-23,12:08 PM,['Samarah Paulino'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-11/simply-stated-is-my-phone-damaging-my-eyes/,"BLAKE ALLEN / DAILY NEXUS Being a student who primarily uses my laptop and tablet for school, I can spend copious hours a day staring at a screen. Time and again, we have been warned about how this heavy usage of mobile devices can affect our eyes ""î specifically, how blue light, the main source of light that most digital devices emit, can cause permanent damage. Some sources, however, have rebutted this argument, stating how the blue light from these devices is not harmful and won't cause any damage to your eyes.† So ""¶ what is the answer? Blue light is part of the visible light spectrum rainbow within the electromagnetic spectrum. With its wavelength being around 400 to 450 nanometers, it has a much higher energy compared to other visible light colors, such as red and orange, on the opposite side of the spectrum. Although there are some exceptions, it can be generally stated that the higher the energy of radiation, the more dangerous and harmful it is. Blue light, therefore, is more likely than other colors to be more damaging to your body at high levels. Does that mean blue light from mobile devices can damage your eyes and increase your likelihood of impaired vision? Right now, the answer is no. Although blue light does have a relatively high energy level, David Ramsey of Harvard Health states ""consumer electronics are not harmful to the retina because of the amount of light emitted.""ù Electronic devices do not produce a high enough intensity of blue light that would be considered damaging or degrading to your eyes. It was found that the most it can do to our eyes is cause them to feel sore or strained, of which there is little to no evidence of causing eventual eye damage. However, not much is known about the long term effects and what may result from intense, daily exposure of our eyes to mobile devices in the long run. A blue light source that is sure to be harmful, however, is the sun. Sunlight, as we all know it, can be very dangerous for our eyes. Of course, if we stare at it as long as we do with our phones, we are bound to have some sort of eye damage. In fact, staring at the sun for even just a few seconds can cause dangerous rays to enter your retina and oxidize the tissues, destroying the eye's rod and cone photoreceptors: neurons that allow your brain to interpret visual information. Although blue light may not affect our eye health does not mean they do not affect other parts of our health. Long periods of exposure to blue light can disrupt your circadian rhythm or ""body clock.""ù Blue light can make us alert and stimulated. This is caused by it having the ability to block the secretion of melatonin, a hormone used by our body to make us feel sleepy. When using digital devices just before we go to bed, it can make it difficult for us to actually fall asleep and get enough rest. This can result in having trouble focusing or learning the next day. In more dangerous cases, when you are repeatedly not getting a healthy amount of rest, chronic health issues are more likely to arise, such as heart disease, kidney disease and depression. Nevertheless, there are still ways in which you can prevent the harmful effects of blue light. When going outside, sunglasses with high quality lenses will be able to protect your eyes from high levels of both visible light and ultraviolet rays. Computer glasses can also be used when spending a large amount of time on electronic devices to filter out blue light and prevent your eyes from feeling strained and to allow for a good night's rest. Another solution is to either lower the brightness of your device or turn on the ""Night Shift""ù mode in your settings for a more gentle light on the eyes. Although it can be said as of now that the blue light from our phones is not destroying our eyes, there is not enough conclusive evidence for long term cases with high levels of daily exposure.

science,Simply Stated: What‚'s actually in my supplements?,25-Aug-23,12:45 PM,['Meenakshi Manoj'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-25/simply-stated-whats-actually-in-my-supplements/,"A July 17 report revealed† that an alarming number of sports supplements contain incorrect amounts of ingredients, traces of prohibited compounds, and missing ingredients that are reported on the labels. Sports supplements, also known as performance dietary supplements, are heavily marketed for their abilities to enhance muscle growth, muscle strength, energy production and recovery, weight gain or loss and nutrients in an athlete. Yet, the sports supplement industry isn't tightly regulated like the pharmaceutical industry, meaning, supplements aren't required to meet specific safety and effectiveness standards before entering the market.† This lack of regulation has led to a greater risk of products being contaminated, missing ingredients and even containing ingredients prohibited by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the past few months, research has shed light on these lesser-known aspects of sports supplements.† The FDA states that it is unable to test all 85,000 supplements that are available in the U.S. According to Pieter Cohen, a general internist at Cambridge Health Alliance, the FDA does not have the authority to approve dietary supplements before they hit the market although they are able to require companies to list the ingredients on the product labels.† Recently, however, it has been confirmed that the supplement industry is not staying true to its product labels. In The Journal of the American Medical Association Network Open, an open-access biomedical sciences journal, a group with researchers from Harvard Medical School, the University of Mississippi and the National Science Foundation (NSF) International studied the presence of five ingredients known to be ""promoted in dietary supplements for their stimulant or anabolic effects""ù to find that 57 of 63 products contained at least one of these ingredients.† Nevertheless, only six of the 57 products with these ingredients had amounts that were within 10% of the label's value, and seven of the 57 supplements contained at least one type of synthetic stimulant that is prohibited by the FDA. These included four synthetic stimulants: 1,4-dimethylamylamine (DMAA), deterenol, octodrine, oxilofrine and omniracetam.† A recent study noted that 1,4-DMAA's safety for human consumption is unknown. In addition, certain supplements contain amounts of octodrine that are over twice the largest pharmaceutical dosage. This compound is unsafe when taken orally, with side effects such as high blood pressure and serious heart problems, and is prohibited in competition according to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.† If consumed, oxilofrine can increase the risk of abnormally high heart rates, chest pain and potentially cardiac arrest. This nootropic, or brain function-enhancing, compound omniracetam is not approved in the U.S. by the FDA given its unknown efficacy and side effects that include fertility damage, insomnia and irritability, among others.† Over the years, scientists have discovered hundreds of supplements containing traces of harmful drugs. This is very concerning, especially during a time when more than half of the American adult population has reported taking dietary supplements. When investing in over-the-counter supplements, it is important to always remain cautious and skeptical. Cohen has said that certain organizations, like the NSF, the Banned Substances Control Group and the U.S. Pharmacopeia, are able to help consumers with evaluating the authenticity of their supplements by providing stamps of approval to the products they evaluate as safe and effective.† Another resource to evaluate supplements is the U.S. Department of Defense's (DoD) Operation Supplement Safety Scorecard checklist. When taking supplements for pre-workout, weight loss and so on, the DoD offers a series of questions to determine the supplement's safety, including ""Is the label free of the words proprietary, blend, matrix, or complex?""ù and ""Is the amount of caffeine listed on the label 200 mg or less per serving?""ù Sports supplements are designed to enhance athletic performance, but not all supplements are created equal. Supplements make up a multi-billion dollar industry with a wide range of products, catering to different needs. It is important to do your research and choose products from reputable companies, as well as understand their purpose and side effects. What works for one athlete may not work for another, and while sports supplements can help enhance athletic performance, nutrients from whole foods are vital for a healthy lifestyle.

science,Q&A with SB Channelkeeper: August is National Water Quality Month!,25-Aug-23,12:57 PM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-25/qa-with-sb-channelkeepers-laura-sanchez-august-is-national-water-quality-month/,"National Water Quality Month was first started in 2005 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to bring awareness to the issue of water pollution, encourage appreciation of the water we do have and inspire people to take action to protect the sources of such water. While only 18 years old, the month has ties to the 1972 Clean Water Act and the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act.† To celebrate and inform ourselves, the Nexus spoke with Communications Director Laura Sanchez of Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, an organization devoted to protecting our water resources:† †Why is protecting water quality important, both globally and locally?†† Water is essential to all life on Earth. However, as populations grow and natural environments degrade worldwide, it's becoming more challenging to ensure that people have safe and sufficient water supplies. Protecting water quality in the Santa Barbara Channel and its watersheds is essential to advance the health and sustainability of communities along the South Coast, aquatic habitats, the channel's remarkable biodiversity and our local economy.
 What kinds of work does SB Channelkeeper do? How is SB Channelkeeper celebrating National Water Quality Month?† Channelkeeper's vision is for clean beaches, healthy, flowing streams and a teeming, resilient ocean that support a thriving economy, offer healthy habitat for fish and wildlife and provide clean water and safe places for recreation for all people and for future generations.† Channelkeeper monitors water quality in the Santa Barbara Channel and surrounding watersheds, educates the community about the importance of keeping our water clean, advocates for protective environmental policies, investigates pollution reports and enforces environmental laws.†† Monitoring: 
Our team gathers and shares water quality data to help decision-makers protect and restore local waterways and to foster wider community awareness and involvement in protecting water quality.† 
 On an ongoing basis, Channelkeeper staff collects plankton samples and sends them to the California State Health Department for analysis as part of our effort to monitor hazardous algal blooms in the Santa Barbara Channel. In addition, our team periodically assists with domoic acid response efforts and important research in the Santa Barbara Channel by collecting water samples and sending them to experts with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project. The data and observations that we collect during these sampling events will help provide a better understanding of the geographic extent and magnitude of algae bloom events.† †Advocacy: 
Through ongoing advocacy efforts to address pollution, habitat destruction and the impacts of climate change and protect both water resources and public health, we work to improve environmental policies at the local, state and national level. Some of the issues that we are currently working on are regulating pollution from irrigated agriculture, evaluating the impacts of aquaculture project development in the Santa Barbara Channel, addressing the environmental impacts and limiting the number of cruise ships that anchor off Santa Barbara and restoring flows to the Ventura River.†† †Education: 
Channelkeeper spreads awareness and inspires environmental stewardship in the next generation by fostering environmental literacy related to water quality through hands-on learning experiences, promoting community appreciation for and connection with nature and by cultivating a sense of shared responsibility for our planet and empowering young people to make a difference at the local level. During the 2022-23 school year, Channelkeeper's education programs reached 1,478 students.† In honor of National Water Quality Month, throughout the month of August, we are working to inspire conversations around actions that our community can take to ensure that we all have access to safe, clean water for generations to come.† We'll be sharing information on our social media and providing opportunities for community members to help keep our waterways clean.††† Channelkeeper Education and Outreach Director Penny Owens collects plantkon samples for analysis as part of our effort to monitor hazardous algal blooms in the Santa Barbara Channel. † How can students and other local community members get involved with organizations like Channelkeeper?  Join Channelkeeper's Watershed Brigade, a community of volunteers dedicated to keeping our local watersheds and beaches clean. Watershed Brigade volunteers meet for monthly cleanups to remove trash from local trails, creeks, rivers, urban areas and beaches in an effort to help reduce pollution at its source. We regularly host beach and community cleanups in Isla Vista!† The next cleanup is on Sept. 23, Coastal Cleanup Day, at West Beach in downtown Santa Barbara. Find more information and sign up here.† Community members can also become ""Marine Project Area Watch""ù volunteers and help Channelkeeper monitor human activity in and around our coastal marine protected areas.† In the meantime, how can individuals help protect our water in their day to day lives? Each of us can take action to keep local waters clean by helping keep trash out of the environment. Report possible sources of pollution and volunteer with Channelkeeper's Watershed Brigade to remove trash from beaches, creeks, rivers and urban areas.† ""î If the issues discussed above are of interest to you and you would like to get more involved locally, there are many additional organizations that monitor and actively work to improve water quality, both on campus and in the larger Santa Barbara and Isla Vista communities. Groups working primarily in Santa Barbara include Heal The Ocean, which aims to improve local wastewater infrastructure, and Santa Barbara Surfrider Foundation, which works to protect all aspects of the coastal ecosystems and communities. If you are looking for opportunities closer to home, Isla Vista also has a chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, which regularly completes water quality reports at major surf sites in I.V. Additionally, UCSB's Environmental Affairs Board organizes many environmental cleanups, lectures, workshops and field trips throughout the school year.† Santa Barbara's beaches have historically ranked highly in terms of cleanliness and water quality. The organization Heal the Bay does annual beach assessments throughout the state of California and has once again this year scored local beaches favorably: 100% of beaches in Santa Barbara County received an A for ""Summer Dry Grades""ù and 100% received As and Bs for ""Winter Dry Grades,""ù with lower grades for the wet season, characteristic of Santa Barbara County.† † For more information, visit these sources:

science,Campus Point: New and exciting research from UCSB,25-Aug-23,1:04 PM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-25/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-from-ucsb-2/,"Binge drinking in mice: Researchers from UC Santa Barbara's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences recently published a study on the psychological effects of binge drinking in mice. The study aimed to study the interactions between age, sex and the age at which binge drinking began, and their cumulative effects on ""negative affect,""ù or feelings of anxiety and hopelessness, as well as cognitive decline later in life. Previous studies have shown that a history of alcohol abuse is one of the biggest risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia and other cognitive disorders. In addition, females have been found to be more likely, on average, to drink in order to alleviate feelings of distress, as well as are more likely to exhibit physical and psychological effects from drinking. These experiments, which built upon prior studies of similar design, uniquely segregated males and females temporally in order to reduce potential ""chemosensory social stimuli""ù (i.e. pheromones) and consisted of giving control mice water to drink and binge-drinking mice (of which there were 92) alcohol for two hours a day for 14 days. Then, evaluations for anxiety symptoms were conducted on the mice, including a light-dark shuttle box test, a marble burying test and a swim test. Additionally, evaluations of cognitive impairment were performed, including mazes and spatial recall tests. Both types of experiments were conducted on Day 1 of withdrawal and Day 70. The researchers predicted that the effects of excessive alcohol consumption would be more pronounced in females than males and that a history of binge drinking during adolescence would have more of an effect on behavior than a history of binge drinking during adulthood. A major result of the study found that adolescents drank more alcohol overall than adults, and females drank more than males.† Test-specific results included adult, female binge-drinkers in the box test going into the light less often than their male counterparts, with more time spent in the dark, implying higher anxiety levels. Additionally, adults and females buried more marbles than adolescents and males, also implying higher stress and feelings of hopelessness, and both female and male binge-drinkers spent more time immobile in the swim test than the water drinkers ""î with immobility being a sign of negative affect. Adult-onset, binge-drinking mice, especially females, were slower to find the hidden platforms and to complete the mazes in the water tests than adolescent-onset binge-drinkers. However, in a subsequent smaller-scale study just looking at Day 1 of withdrawal, the differences in effects between sex and age were less distinct, with relatively few symptoms of negative affect. Overall, there were few effects of ""robust binge-drinking""ù on negative affect and only slight evidence of alcohol-induced cognitive effects. The only significant evidence from the water mazes was that adolescent-onset mice were slightly worse at spatial recall than adult-onset binge drinkers. The authors predict that these results may be related to a lower sensitivity of maze experiments and that two weeks of binge drinking may not be enough to cause significant cognitive effects. Similarly, 3.5 months of age might not be old enough to detect cognitive decline in mice with a history of binge drinking. Nevertheless, despite the need for additional studies on how individual factors like age, sex and age of onset interact, this paper provides promising insight into how a history of drinking in humans could lead to higher chances of developing cognitive disorders later in life. † Gauging glacier cycles: One of the aspects of climate change that scientists have long been interested in studying is how the planet's climate has changed over geologic time. With global temperatures on the rise, glacial melting has been an issue of particular concern. It has been concluded that the pattern of glacial cycles over the past 800,000 years or so are approximately 100,000 years (kyr) long, and have to do with changes in Earth's ""Milankovitch cycles.""ù These three orbital cycles ""î eccentricity, obliquity and precession ""î control changes in ice sheet size as the amount of solar radiation reaching different parts of the planet shifts. Until recently, uncertainties regarding the age of ice sheets have made it difficult to determine whether the considerable changes in size were more strongly associated with obliquity ""î the angle of Earth's axis of rotation ""î or precession ""î† the ""wobbling""ù of Earth on its axis as it rotates ""î although there is significant statistical evidence for both having some impact.† A new study by UCSB's Department of Earth Science, using improved age estimates, compared the impacts of 41-kyr obliquity cycles and 100-kyr eccentricity cycles on glacial cycles in order to determine which has been historically more responsible for glacial period terminations. Many experts to date believe that cycles of eccentricity ""î the shape of Earth's orbit shape ""î modulate the amplitude of the Earth's precession, allowing for periods of lower ""insolation,""ù or the amount of solar radiation reaching a particular area ""î in this case, the ice sheets in question. Additionally, it was hypothesized that precession cycles allow for higher intensity of and changes in insolation, especially during the summer months, which could account for dramatic changes in ice sheet size. The contrasting hypothesis maintains that glacial terminations during the Late Pleistocene Epoch occurred every two to three cycles of obliquity, which therefore must be the primary driver of ice sheet variability. The paper outlines their methodology and how they dated glacial terminations in order to quantify the effect of the various orbital cycles. The team used records of sea level change over geologic time, alongside age estimates derived from correlating ""ice-rafted debris""ù in the North Atlantic Ocean to instances of abrupt Asian monsoon variability. After extensive statistical analysis, the researchers ultimately found that while both precession and obliquity phases have statistically significant effects on glacial termination onset, the precession phase seems to be, by its forcing of summer insolation intensity, more predictive of termination onset, particularly for the largest events.† † Cell stress:† Many diseases and disorders result from the combination of our past experiences of stress and trauma. Late-onset health conditions, unfortunately, appear many times seemingly out of the blue, and too late to stop before they get out of hand. Our cells, however, hold memories of our past experiences, which can potentially be used to predict and influence the way we react to future physiological stressors. A team of researchers at UCSB, led by senior author and Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology assistant professor Max Wilson recently found a way to map out our histories of cellular stress, known as a ""cellular stress memory landscape,""ù in order to explore how stress-induced diseases occur. When our bodies encounter stressors like pathogens, toxins or experiences of trauma, something called the integrated stress response (ISR) is initiated. The ISR is a signaling pathway our cells use to adapt to negative conditions. The stress memory landscape is a central part of the ISR mechanism and holds key information regarding our bodies' ability to protect themselves and regenerate. The researchers in this study developed a way to induce ISR using simulated stress, by shining light on certain light-responsive proteins within the system. This allowed them to observe the direct effects of stress without any permanent damage or cascading effects potentially affecting the body's response. They also created a model to see whether future stress responses depend on past responses. The results of this study, including that cellular stress memory is a combination of past stress and recovery time, may have significant implications for the future of disease prevention. If ISR pathways can be manipulated in this way, as well as potentially cellular stress memory landscapes, this could one day allow the ability to identify early on, and possibly even prevent, stress-induced diseases and conditions, including those relating to the malfunctioning of stress responses.  † A version of this article appeared on p. 16 of the August 24 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,Simply Stated: Curious about curiosity? Why do we seek answers?,26-Aug-23,7:48 PM,['Olivia Gil de Bernabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-08-26/simply-stated-curious-about-curiosity-why-do-we-seek-answers/,"Curiosity, the trait concerning an individual's propensity to seek new information, is highly variable. We know this personally; some topics have us dying to know more about, while others bore us to death. Why do some things coax curiosity out of us? And if curiosity drives us to seek new information, what is its role in learning especially when it comes to us, as university students? Developmentally speaking, curiosity is crucial. It is observable in information-seeking, a type of behavior in young children that is marked by the posing of ""curiosity questions.""ù When children encounter things that interest them or don't match with pre-existing notions of the world, they seek further knowledge by asking questions. This is the mythical phase of toddler-dom where they seem to ask questions about anything and everything. Through this endless questioning, children are able to construct intuitive theories that help them better predict and interact with the world around them. As we grow into the world, we may not need to be constantly posing questions to those around us. But, because we never fully stop learning, curiosity remains a useful trait. Scientists investigating the associations between learning and curiosity have found that curiosity is associated with better learning outcomes, including enhancing memory recall.† In a study investigating this association, researchers used the task of trivia questions to measure participants' curiosity about the trivia answers. It was found that activity in the caudate regions of the brain, which are responsible for curiosity, learning and memory, among other cognitive functions, increased when participants guessed the answers to trivia incorrectly. When participants were asked the same questions one to two weeks later, the higher curiosity questions were correlated with better recall of answers. It was concluded that curiosity enhances memory recall, thus facilitating the process of learning new information. So, curiosity is helpful to us learners in that it helps us remember things better, but what do we know about what piques our curiosity, and what doesn't? In the previous study, why did curiosity about the correct answer increase when participants were incorrect? A popular theory is that curiosity is triggered by the detection of incomplete knowledge.† The findings of a study that utilized trivia questioning, similar to the previous one, support this theory. Participants were posed with trivia questions such as ""For which president was the blueberry jelly bean made?""ù and then asked to provide their best guess, an estimate of how close their guess was, whether they thought their guess was correct and their curiosity about the correct answer. Once they saw the correct answer, they were asked to indicate how surprised they were. When analyzing the data, researchers of the study found that curiosity of the correct answer peaked when participants believed they were close to learning the information, but had guessed it incorrectly.† To put it in terms of a scenario you have probably encountered, it's like when you have poured over the details of a midterm topic and found out that you were wrong on a question you thought you knew. You feel the need to know the right answer so that you can come to terms with your previous erroneous understanding.† Ultimately, the researchers posited that curiosity is best predicted by a learner's metacognitive estimate of their own knowledge, while learning is better predicted by a measure of existing knowledge. They also pointed out a feedback loop: First, a learner's perception of their prior knowledge is related to greater curiosity for new information; second, curiosity is associated with better learning outcomes.† Following this line of reasoning, we may see why we have curiosity for things that we have a basic understanding of but don't fully have figured out. As the researchers highlight, learners' awareness of their current state of knowledge is important. Most importantly, however, they emphasize that their findings support the idea that educators should aim to provide material that is just beyond the level that has been mastered.† As students, we don't have any say in the course material we take on. But next time you are faced with a looming expanse of information foreign to you, take some time to identify what you do know. By taking it one step at a time, maybe you can trigger curiosity and make the process of learning a more enjoyable, less stressful experience.††

science,UCSB alum oversees program achieving fusion ignition breakthrough,6-Sep-23,8:34 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-09-06/ucsb-alum-oversees-program-achieving-fusion-ignition-breakthrough/,"For six decades, scientists have been working towards realizing the concept of inertial confinement fusion, in which a fusion ignition releases more energy than it takes to put in. In December 2022, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved a historic breakthrough in science by facilitating a successful fusion ignition ""î a game changer for the future of nuclear defense and clean energy.† The experiment required 192 laser beams, each longer than a football field, to hit a target of deuterium and tritium, heavier and radioactive isotopes of hydrogen, respectively. This small volume of hydrogen fuel was heated and compressed by the lasers, resulting in the fusion of atoms. UC Santa Barbara alum Sarah Nelson, acting office director of the Office of Experimental Sciences at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), helped oversee and manage the research and development program that achieved this.† ""Fusing those atoms together is not something mother nature wants to do naturally, requiring extreme temperatures and pressures to overcome the repulsion between the nuclei,""ù explained Nelson. ""Fusion is the power source of the Sun and other stars, where hydrogen nuclei such as deuterium (D) and tritium (T) are fused into helium. Researchers focus on DT reactions both because they produce large amounts of energy and they occur at lower temperatures than other elements.""ù The experiment was successfully replicated by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in August 2023, producing an even higher energy yield than that of the initial shot. The reproducibility of the experiment points toward a future of many other discoveries at the forefront of science that have capabilities to benefit society.† One such benefit is maintaining the safety and security of the nuclear stockpile without resorting to nuclear testing. In addition, the breakthrough opens the possibility for a future of clean energy. According to Nelson, the two shots that have already been accomplished would need to happen 10 times a second to support something like a power plant. Although the research is far from being able to put energy on the grid, this experiment has shown that it is possible.† Nelson, along with NNSA physical scientist Samantha Calkins, was recently named a Service to America Medals finalist for energy innovation. In light of this recognition, Nelson paid tribute to those who came before her.† ""I am just the latest person, along with Samantha Calkins, to be filling these roles, and a number of people in the past have advocated for this program over the years,""ù Nelson said. ""I feel so lucky and this is such an honor to be able to be doing this work right now.""ù† Reflecting upon her career path, Nelson recalls her experience as a UCSB undergraduate student working in professor Steven Buratto's lab in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Here she found a community of support, encouragement and freedom to explore the field of science. As an undergraduate student she enrolled in an internship program at the LLNL, the very place where the ignition breakthrough occurred. When Nelson received news of the experiment's success, she recognized how far both she and the science had come. ""I thought back to the time when I was taking a tour of the National Ignition Facility in Livermore, California as an undergraduate before its construction had even finished,""ù Nelson recalled. ""What a fantastic experience to witness when this machine was being constructed in 2002 [and then] to [be] the one who happens to be in the chair running this program in 2022.""ù As a woman in S.T.E.M., Nelson encourages women to continue to pursue science and technology despite what others may say. ""The tide is changing,""ù Nelson said. ""Do not let the opinions of others turn into your own voice. Women in science are just as valuable and should feel confident in their contributions.""ù Nelson and the National Ignition Facility continue to conduct research to advance the progress of this recent achievement as well as improve the results of the ignition experiments and their potential applications. A friend of my younger brother claims that the $700 is little in light of the millions he has donated to Ukraine. Why? She said, ""We need it. We don't know sg-06 why, therefore that's why. We have citizenship.

science,Simply Stated: Is your morning oat milk latte bad for you?,15-Sep-23,7:01 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-09-15/simply-stated-is-your-morning-oat-milk-latte-bad-for-you/,"Plant-based milk alternatives have been on the rise and, more recently, oat milk has become a popular choice. Almost every coffee shop you walk into will have oat milk as an alternative for lattes and other beverages. It is much more eco-friendly than cow's milk and has many benefits for those who seek a vegan alternative but, despite its popularity and marketing as a healthy milk option, some nutritionists are concerned about whether or not oat milk is actually good for you. One major benefit of oat milk is that many store-bought brands are fortified with calcium, Vitamin D and Vitamin B-12 ""î an especially important vitamin for people on vegan diets. Oats also contain beta-glucan which lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, otherwise known as the ""bad cholesterol.""ù Beta-glucan can help lower the risk of heart disease due to its gel-like properties that aid in the excretion of cholesterol. However, oat milk lacks the amount of Vitamin B-12 that cow's milk contains, and those who opt for this alternative are recommended by dieticians to seek a B-12 supplement. Oat milk also contains much less protein in comparison to cow's milk, another factor to consider when incorporating it into your diet.† In addition to these nutritional concerns, one of the major downsides of oat milk is that most available products are considered ""ultra-processed,""ù meaning that there are a significant amount of additives and other added ingredients. Some oat milk brands may contain added sugars, emulsifiers and highly processed gums for thickening. One study has shown that a diet containing mostly ultra-processed foods significantly increases the risk of cancer and heart disease. However, oat milk is generally safe in moderation and is recommended to be consumed in conjunction with foods or supplements that provide the necessary nutrients missing from traditional cow's milk such as vitamins D, A, B-12 and calcium. So, how does oat milk compare to other plant-based milk alternatives, such as almond milk and soy milk? Many oat milk and almond milk brands contain the same fortifying vitamins and minerals, but oat milk contains higher amounts of protein, fat and fiber. Soy milk has a very similar nutritional profile to both of these options but contains the highest protein content. Although there are some nutritional differences between these options, choosing one over another will likely not make a significant impact on your health. When weighing which milk option to choose, cost is another factor that many might want to consider. Oat milk is generally the most expensive and costs about twice as much as dairy milk. A possible alternative to store-bought oat milk is making oat milk at home ""î a simple and much cheaper option. Homemade oat milk also avoids the many additives and highly processed ingredients that store-bought products use. If you choose to make your own oat milk, you can also fortify it with supplemental vitamins and minerals. Finally, another major factor that many consider when choosing a milk alternative is how environmentally friendly it is. Oat milk is one of the most sustainable options because it uses the least amount of water and emits low amounts of greenhouse gasses. On the other hand, almond milk uses less land resources than oat milk but requires the most amount of water out of all plant-based milk alternatives. This option is not ideal in terms of water conservation, as it takes 3.2 gallons of water to produce a single almond.† Soy milk also produces a low amount of greenhouse gas emissions and requires much less water than almond milk, but it is a significant driver of deforestation ""î particularly in the Amazon rainforest. To avoid contributing to this, soy milk can be bought from brands using soybeans grown in the United States. Despite these differences, all plant-based milk is overall more environmentally friendly than cow's milk because of dairy farming's carbon emissions. Not only is cattle farming the biggest agricultural contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, but it also contributes heavily to deforestation.† Due to the nutritional concerns surrounding oat milk, it is not necessarily as healthy as it is often made out to be. However, while it is not considered a superfood, this does not mean it is extremely bad for your health. Oat milk is safe to consume in moderation, so there is no need for oat milk lovers to fear. But, if you do opt for oat milk as a dairy alternative, you might want to look into choosing high-quality brands that avoid highly processed ingredients and additives, or maybe even try making some at home!

science,Santa Barbara County Public Health Department releases STI data,5-Oct-23,9:00 AM,"['Sindhu Ananthavel', 'Olivia Gil de Bernabe']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-05/santa-barbara-county-public-health-department-releases-sti-data/,"The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department released updated data on five sexually transmitted infections within the county this month. The data is collected from mandated health provider and laboratory reporting up to 2022, according to a press release from the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD), and spans five sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhea, early syphilis, HIV and Mpox. Key county trends SBCPHD made note of in the press release were that chlamydia rates are on the rise and more likely to be diagnosed in women under 25 years of age. Gonorrhea was more likely to be diagnosed in men 25-34 years old. Early syphilis experienced a significant increase among women of childbearing age and the burden of disease shifted to North County. Compared to the state, SB County rates were lower across all reported STIs.† ""These trends highlight the importance of getting tested, especially pregnant people at their initial prenatal appointment and again for syphilis during their 3rd[[third]] trimester,""ù Michelle Wehmer, epidemiologist at SBCPHD and author of the STI report, said in the SBCPHD press release.† Chlamydia, an STI caused by chlamydia trachomatis bacteria, can be contracted by anyone, regardless of gender. It is spread through vaginal, anal and oral sex.† There were 1749 cases of chlamydia recorded in 2022. Over 50% of these cases were of people aged 25 and under, and 50% of overall cases came from North County. Two in three cases diagnosed were of women, and 64% of all cases were of people who were multiracial, ""other""ù ""î not Asian, Latine, Black or white ""î or otherwise unknown ethnicity.† There were 572 cases of gonorrhea recorded in 2022. Over 40% of these cases were of people aged 25 and under, and North and South County both carried 43% of these cases, respectively. Three in five cases diagnosed were of men, and 47% of these cases were of Latine people.† Though it's easily cured with antibiotics, chlamydia and gonorrhea are often left untreated because most people with it experience little to no symptoms. This can lead to chronic health complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Syphilis is an STI that begins presenting itself with painless sores and can cause serious health problems, including damage to the nervous system, heart and eyes. It can progress through four different stages and is most contagious two to 12 weeks after exposure, wherein painless sores often go unnoticed. There were 112 cases of early syphilis recorded in 2022, from which 32% were of people aged 25-34 years old and North County carried 63% of the cases. Four in five cases diagnosed were of men, and 57% of all cases were of Latine people.†Santa Barbara County Public Health Officer Henning Ansorg and Santa Barbara County Health Care Center Staff Physician Chelsea Dean issued a call to action to county medical providers for increased screening for STIs. Recommendations included testing any adult patient with bacterial STI for HIV as well, annually testing for STIs if there is a history of bacterial STI and doing gonorrhea and chlamydia testing at oral and rectal sites in addition to urine.† ""Considering the increasing rates of STIs, we (local STI providers) recommend aggressive and routine screening for all STIs in the general public. We need to promote awareness of STIs whenever possible,""ù the call to action stated. ""In order for us to truly get on top of diagnosis and treating STIs, we must start addressing the stigma that surrounds STIs. It is important to approach testing for and diagnosing STIs with an open-minded, non-judgmental approach.""ù Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of STIs. Prevention and early intervention are key to treatment. If you are sexually active, it is advisable to get tested for STIs at least once a year.† At UC Santa Barbara, testing for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HIV is available at no cost with the UCSB Student Health Insurance Plan and low cost without it through the student health portal. Both UCSB Student Health Service and SBCPHD emphasize the importance of condom use. Proper condom usage greatly reduces the risk of STI transmission and contraction.

science,Campus Point: New and Exciting Research at UCSB,5-Oct-23,9:00 AM,['Roshan Mishra'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-05/campus-point-new-and-exciting-research-at-ucsb-21/,"Predicting climate crises As the global climate crisis intensifies, it becomes more imperative to predict when specific climate-related disasters will take place. A recent paper describes UC Santa Barbara climate scientist and researcher Chris Funk's work in predicting when these disasters will take place with a focus on the Eastern Horn of Africa. Droughts are increasingly common in this region and have led to massive ecological instability and food insecurity. Funk's Climate Hazards Center (CHC), created and managed under his supervision, has been able to coordinate with local government and foreign aid agencies to ensure that millions of dollars in food and medical aid are sent to affected populations. By studying particular weather patterns in the region, the CHC are able to discern when decreased moisture will affect Eastern Africa through the initiation of these devastating droughts and have been able to respond appropriately and efficiently. Funk states that while crises such as droughts and floods still occur, their effects can be mitigated via usage of his prediction model. ""Flooding still happens, drought still happens, people still get hurt, but we can try to reduce the harm,""ù he said. The paper further details CHC's collaboration with Plant Village, an activist group working on-site with Kenyan farmers to create drought-resistant crops. Funk's current goal is to create a response doctrine for Eastern Africa when it comes to droughts and other climate-related disasters by being able to understand how exactly they originate and how best to respond to them. While these efforts may initially be costly, Funk insists they are a superior long-term investment to conventional humanitarian aid programs.† Fundamental fungi A recent study by UC Santa Barbara's Department of Chemical Engineering revealed that the RNA content of fungi is in fact crucial for several advancements in biotechnology. Unfortunately, most studies attempting to harness these abilities have only extracted fungal genome sequences from one specific fungal growth. This study, however, attempts to harvest RNA from two different growth types, monoculture and methanogen co-culture. Initial findings yielded that these RNA structures could become vital in designing bioreactors for environmental purposes (such as the preservation of natural flora) or even identifying metabolites within our own bodies. Anaerobic fungi could become a scientific boon regarding this process, but only if their RNA is extracted at a particular time. ""We found that the regulation of [several] fungal genes ""¶ varied at each 24-hour timepoint of the exponential growth phase.""ù These findings are validated by examples taken from the study itself. Certain fungal strains, when grown on methanogen (an environmentally vital microorganism), create encoded carbohydrate-active enzymes which could become instrumental regarding wider biotechnical research. However, the expression patterns yielding these enzymes changed about 24 hours into the experiment, insisting upon just how important the methods are to extract fungi at multiple points in time during cultivation, meaning they intend to further their research. Disease-detecting dogs In the years since its initial 2020 spread, the COVID-19 virus has culturally and politically moved from an international pandemic to a practical fact of life. Still, the dangers it poses cannot be understated. Recently, a research initiative by UC Santa Barbara geography professor Tommy Dickey, collaborating with Heather Junqueira of BioScent DX Inc., has revealed that man's canine friends could become the key to a more efficient, environmentally friendly method of COVID-19 detection. The crux of these findings lies in the incredibly powerful sense of smell dogs possess. ""A dog could detect the equivalent of one drop of [odorous] liquid in 20 Olympic-size swimming pools,""ù Dickey said. For perspective, this is about three orders of magnitude better than with scientific instrumentation. In some cases, dogs were able to detect COVID-19 in pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients whose viral load was too low for conventional tests to work. Not only that, but dogs can distinguish COVID-19 and its variants in the presence of other potentially confounding respiratory viruses, such as those of the common cold or flu. Efficiency becomes key when trying to detect COVID-19; given its immense potential to proliferate within crowded areas, the speed of canine-based detection could become vital in preventing future super-spreader events. An even greater advantage of utilizing dogs for COVID-19 lies in the variety of dogs capable of rooting out the virus. Scent dogs such as beagles, basset hounds and coonhounds would be the ideal dog for the task. A program geared toward canine detection of COVID-19 would bring many benefits and has significant potential for controlling the spread of future pandemics as well as identifying other medical conditions.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Oct. 5, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,UCSB S.T.E.M. departments celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month,5-Oct-23,9:00 AM,['Alissa Orozco'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-05/ucsb-s-t-e-m-departments-celebrate-hispanic-heritage-month/,"As a day on which several Spanish-speaking countries celebrate their independence, Sept. 15 marked the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, the annual celebration of the contributions and influences of Americans whose families come from Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America.† With such a large population, those of Hispanic descent are found in every department here at UC Santa Barbara. In particular, several S.T.E.M. departments on campus are shining a spotlight on their researchers who identify as part of these minority groups and are currently taking part in cutting-edge, innovative research, from creating quantum materials and manufacturing newly-discovered metals to theorizing well-defined and functional polymers and biomaterials. In 2015, UCSB was designated both a Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education, meaning at least 25% of enrolled students identify as Hispanic, Latinx and/or Chicanx.† ""Community is a big thing for Hispanic folks ""î culturally, it's something we really appreciate,""ù assistant materials professor Daniel Oropeza said. Oropeza, who came to UCSB in July 2023, leads a research team that studies the manufacturing and processing of materials, such as metals and ceramics. ""[W]e have some fantastic people to do all design and understanding of structural mechanics;† I try to fit somewhere in between them to help them get from material synthesis to structural understanding,""ù† Oropeza said. Just recently, UCSB's College of Engineering created a webpage dedicated to celebrating their Hispanic faculty. One featured researcher is Daniela Rivera Mirabal, a third-year doctoral student in the department of Chemical Engineering. Mirabal grew up and studied in Puerto Rico and is currently working on developing a model to understand different materials' chemistries and sequences. ""I think my background has especially motivated my passion for mentoring. Especially from not seeing that much representation in the broader scientific sphere, it has inspired me to want to mentor more students,""ù Mirabal said. Over this past summer, Mirabal worked with the Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships, working with first-generation students from various† S.T.E.M. fields.† According to UCSB's 2022-23 campus profile, 28% of newly enrolled freshmen identified themselves as Hispanic/Latinx/Chicanx and 48% of freshmen chose to study physical and biological sciences.† Many of UCSB's faculty members are also from Latin America: Juliana Acosta-Uribe, a research assistant in the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, graduated from the University of Antioquia in Medell√≠n, Colombia in 2013. She subsequently spent the next three years studying hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.† Acosta-Uribe was eventually invited to continue her research at UCSB and has continued to study population genetics, especially in those of Latin American descent. ""I would love to have more Latin American students in the lab since my research directly involves their own people,""ù Acosta-Uribe said.† Every day across multiple S.T.E.M. departments at UCSB, members of the Latinx and Chicanx communities are becoming leaders in their fields. ""I'm sort of like the chef of the quantum world ""î I figure out how to make interesting materials that people care about. We [discover] new materials and try to search for things that people haven't thought about yet""ù† said Steven Gomez-Alvarado, a doctoral student in the materials department.† For first-generation students, such as Gomez-Alvarado, this sense of accomplishment is incredibly important. ""I'm fortunate enough to have my grandparents still alive, and talking to them about what I do is probably the most exciting thing that lights up their eyes,""ù Gomez-Alvarado said.†† This month is dedicated to acknowledging the sacrifices and legacies of both past and current generations of Hispanic Americans. Their research and contributions in science, medicine, engineering and mathematics ""î to name just a few ""î will continue to help create a stronger, more inclusive future for us all. ""When I think about Hispanic Heritage Month, it's a time for me to tie back to my roots and be especially grateful to be in S.T.E.M. [and be] grateful for the people that have paved the way beforehand [while] at the same time pushing for more representation,""ù Mirabal said.

science,Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary enters final quarter of public comment phase,12-Oct-23,9:00 AM,['Lizzy Rager'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-12/chumash-heritage-national-marine-sanctuary-enters-the-final-quarter-of-its-public-comment-phase-on-track-for-a-2024-official-designation/,"The proposed sanctuary would encompass over 5,000 square miles of marine waters off the Central California coast. Courtesy of Flickr. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is nearing the close of its public comment phase, making it one step closer to official designation.† The sanctuary entered the designation last year. So far, it has seen tremendous support, according to key stakeholders. Distinctively, the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) is the first sanctuary designation to use a collaborative management initiative between an Indigenous group ""î the Northern Chumash Tribal Council ""î and federal agencies ""î the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the state of California. ""The United States, for the first time, is acknowledging that indigenous people have a deep connection to our oceans as well as our lands,""ù Kenneth Kahn, tribal chairman for the Santa Ynez band of Chumash Indians and one of the collaborative managers of CHNMS, said in an email statement to the Nexus. ""That's a paradigm shift. Until now, all U.S. laws and policies have focused on land-based governance. I hope our tribe is paving the way for others across the nation to also regain their maritime culture.""ù CHNMS concerns the preservation of culturally important sites for the Chumash people and an important ecological transition zone that supports a diverse array of marine life. The sanctuary would connect the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (NMS) to the Monterey Bay NMS. In August, NOAA released its preferred boundary alternative that redacted some parts of the original boundary that the Northern Chumash Tribal Council proposed back in 2015.† NOAA's boundaries span 134 miles of coastline from San Luis Obispo county to Naples,† encompassing 5,600 square miles. It leaves out 22 more miles of coastline and 2,100 more square miles of water from the Chumash-preferred boundaries but expands coastal land to entirely include state parks.† A large corridor of land was redacted due to industrial development, said NOAA West Coast Regional Policy Coordinator Paul Michel. Specifically, there are 30 cables from the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area to shore that could cause disturbances with preservation efforts.† Map of the proposed area for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Courtesy of NOAA. Though most of the public comments have shown support for the NOAA proposal, the biggest concern has been the removal of this land, said Michel. Some of the concerns posed in the public comment section about Morro Bay were that wind turbines should not be in the same environment as marine life and that they contribute to pollution. Additionally, some proponents noted frustration with the Chumash tribe getting the primary recognition and role in the sanctuary designation, which leaves out other relevant tribes. Kahn said that it has been difficult to navigate the relationship between their tribe and other tribes. The Santa Ynez band of Chumash Indians is the only federally recognized Chumash group in the nation.† ""We have tried to use our status as the federally recognized group to uplift the voices of others and make sure these groups have the ability to be involved in the process,""ù Kahn said in an email statement to the Nexus. ""But also we have been careful to protect the special government-to-government relationship we have with the U.S. as the only federally recognized tribe in the region.""ù Kahn also said the collaboration process between the Northern Chumash Tribal Council and NOAA has evolved positively. ""When this process started, NOAA and the Department of Commerce as a whole did not take tribal co-management seriously. That's changed,""ù Kahn said. ""It took staff really spending time getting to understand the nuances of the federal trust responsibility.""ù The Santa Ynez band of Chumash Indians, Kahn said, have served a few key roles under the draft management plan for the CHNMS, proposed by NOAA. The tribe serves as collaborative managers, working closely with the state of California and the sanctuary director to ""set broad policy objectives and provide oversight""ù with the daily work of sanctuary staff.† They also serve on the Sanctuary Advisory Council,† ""which provides the sanctuary director more concrete guidance on the day-to-day operations.""ù This includes advising on ways to incorporate Indigenous cultural issues. Stewards of the land, the Chumash and Salinan people seek to preserve their cultural heritage as one of the few ocean-going bands among the First Peoples of the Pacific Coast. Moreover, the designation helps preserve natural resources these tribes once lived and thrived off of. Offshore energy development, pollution, vessel traffic, coastal development and other stressors are threats to the land. Achieving sanctuary status would mean research and education efforts could be invested into the land and certain prohibitions would prevent the former threats. Michel said NOAA has been conducting research to build baseline data for the sanctuary. ""[Recently,] we've been doing soundscape monitoring. Characterizing what are the natural and man-made noises in the ocean of this coast,""ù Michel said. A graduate research project for UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management worked for NOAA over the summer to gather data on assessing and controlling marine debris in the proposed designation.† Eleri Griffiths, the project manager and second-year environmental science and management graduate student, said the research fills in the gaps on existing marine debris collection data by coding the amount of debris recorded along areas of the coast for a Geographic Information System map. They plan to finish the data collection by winter quarter. ""[The sanctuary is] part of this convergence zone of both currents coming from north to south and south to north. That creates a really dynamic ecological environment for marine life,""ù Griffiths said in a Nexus interview. ""And this will be interesting as we start to analyze our data and look at results to just see how the† converging currents and different types of ocean dynamics may affect marine debris distribution across the region.""ù Once the designation is officiated, there is potential for more research and education efforts, along with economic benefits. Research indicates that the designation could create 600 new jobs and generate an estimated $23 million in economic activity. Furthermore, Michel said that the sanctuary may count toward the Biden-Harris 30 by 30 initiative, which aims to protect 30% of land and water by 2030. While Michel is not sure how sanctuaries fit into the initiative at the moment, he believes they will count going forward. Anyone may submit public comment through Regulations.gov until Oct. 26. After the public comment period closes, final designation documents will be prepared throughout 2023, and the sanctuary is slated to be officially designated in 2024.

science,Simply Stated: What‚'s the tea on caffeine?,19-Oct-23,9:00 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-19/simply-stated-whats-the-tea-on-caffeine/,"Whether it is grabbing a Guayak√≠ Yerba Mate from the Arbor before hitting the library or downing a cup of coffee in an attempt to stay awake for an 8 a.m. class, many UC Santa Barbara students rely on caffeine to help them focus. Studies have shown that caffeine enhances cognitive performance by improving energy, alertness and reflexes. Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors and blocks adenosine, the neurotransmitter responsible for making us sleepy. It also boosts positive feelings by increasing the flow of dopamine in our brains. Caffeine is also associated with other mental benefits such as helping to consolidate learning, reducing cognitive decline and decreasing the risk of depression. Registered Dietician Carrie Flack at UC Santa Barbara Student Health discusses research in caffeine's possible prevention of some diseases. ""Caffeine is studied in relation to the possible treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases,""ù Flack explained. ""In epidemiological reports, caffeine consumption was associated with significantly lower risk of developing them.""ù These benefits are promising, but what happens if you drink too much coffee? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends no more than 400 mg of caffeine per day ""î about three or four cups of brewed coffee. Regular consumption of caffeine past this limit poses a potential risk to physical and mental health. For reference, a venti-brewed coffee from Starbucks contains about 415 mg of caffeine, a Celsius energy drink contains 200 mg and a can of Guayak√≠ Yerba Mate contains anywhere from 60-150 mg of caffeine. Despite its benefits, too much caffeine can have undesirable side effects such as restlessness, insomnia, rapid heartbeat, agitation and headaches.† At high doses of caffeine, you might experience the ""jitters,""ù characterized by shakiness, nervousness and anxiety. People with underlying mental health issues such as anxiety and panic disorders might be more susceptible to these symptoms and experience them more intensely. Many side effects are also experienced by people with caffeine sensitivity at doses as low as 10 mg. Consuming too much caffeine too often can also cause dependency.† ""It is possible to become addicted to caffeine in the sense that individuals regularly consuming caffeine may become physically dependent on it to function optimally or feel normal,""ù Flack said. ""The body adjusts to caffeine intake by becoming less responsive to it or by developing tolerance to it.""ù People with a caffeine addiction can experience withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, drowsiness and irritability if caffeine intake is stopped abruptly. Therefore, it is more beneficial to ease off of caffeine rather than quitting cold turkey when someone is caffeine-dependent. Intake of caffeine close to bedtime can also affect the quality of sleep due to its half-life of four to six hours. This means that for up to six hours after drinking that cup of coffee, half of the caffeine consumed is still present in the bloodstream. Although it does help you stay awake at night by delaying the increase of melatonin levels, the hormone that promotes sleep, it can contribute to feeling groggy in the morning. A study has shown that caffeine affects your circadian rhythm ""î not only does it cause you to fall asleep later, but it also causes you to wake up later.† People who choose to avoid caffeine but still enjoy the taste of coffee might turn to decaffeinated coffee, which typically contains only two to five mg of caffeine.† Decaffeinated coffee uses the water processing method, or Swiss Water Process. It water instead of solvents and is a natural, reusable process. A mixture of water and extract from green coffee beans is used to soak the beans, which removes the caffeine. The leftover caffeine-rich solution is then passed through activated charcoal that absorbs the caffeine. This is then used for the next batch of beans to be decaffeinated. Water processing typically preserves the flavor profile of the beans which go on to be dried and roasted.† Another method is the direct solvent method which uses ethyl acetate or methylene chloride to directly dissolve caffeine from the coffee beans. Ethyl acetate is a natural byproduct of sugar production and is also commonly used in paints, perfumes and nail polish. Methylene chloride is a harmful chemical whose residues are removed through the drying and roasting process of decaffeination. The use of this chemical is not usually advertised, so it has likely been used if the product does not say ""water processed""ù or ""natural/sugar processed.""ù Methylene chloride in decaffeination is deemed safe by the FDA, but it typically produces coffee with low-quality flavor. The indirect solvent method is common in Europe and also uses ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Coffee beans are boiled to extract the coffee oil and flavors, which are collected in the water. The beans are treated with the solvent and then heated, which evaporates both the caffeine and the solvent. They are then combined with the initial water solution, restoring flavor and oils to the coffee beans. Lastly, the carbon dioxide method soaks coffee beans in highly compressed liquid carbon dioxide. This method removes only the caffeine from the beans, preserving their flavor profile. Activated carbon filters are then used to separate the coffee beans from the carbon dioxide, which is reused for the next batch. Decaffeinated coffee is overall safe, but you may want to know what you're buying before you purchase another batch.† If you want to consume regular coffee but limit your caffeine intake, there are a few things you can do. It is recommended to not have any caffeine within an hour of waking up, which will help maintain a normal circadian rhythm. Caffeine during this time is unnecessary because our bodies produce cortisol after waking up ""î a natural energy booster. To help with sleep hygiene, drink caffeine no less than six hours before bedtime. Lastly, if you are not caffeine-dependent, consider drinking it more sparingly and only when you really need an energy boost. Although coffee is a best friend to many of us, don't underestimate the power of caffeine the next time you brew a cup!

science,"‚""The Heat Will Kill You First‚""ù: Writer Jeff Goodell warns against extreme heat, says we are not doomed",26-Oct-23,9:00 AM,['Olivia Lohrer'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-26/the-heat-will-kill-you-first-writer-jeff-goodell-warns-against-extreme-heat-says-we-are-not-doomed/,"You probably heard it on the radio, read it in the newspaper or saw a post on Instagram at some point over the past few months: 2023 was the hottest summer ever recorded in human history. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Sept. 14 report, June to August, the period considered the meteorological summer of the Northern Hemisphere, was .41 F (.23 C) warmer than any other summer since 1880, and 2.1 F (1.2 C) warmer than the average summer between 1951 and 1980. These seemingly slight temperature increases did not go unfelt: approximately 190 million Americans were placed under heat alerts, according to the National Weather Service.† But what exactly is heat, and why is it so destructive?† Prior to starting his most recent book, climate journalist and now-seasoned heat expert Jeff Goodell found himself asking the same question. During a public lecture at UC Santa Barbara's Campbell Hall on Oct. 17, Goodell remarked that a particularly grueling fifteen-block walk in Phoenix changed the way he understood heat by prompting his realization that ""heat is really dangerous.""ù ""If you would have asked me that morning, ""òWhat is heat?'""ù Goodell said, ""I would have said, ""òWell, heat is temperature.' But, of course, heat is not temperature.""ù In both the lecture and the prologue of his book, Goodell offers a succinct way to think about heat in the context of anthropogenic climate change. ""Heat is the engine of planetary chaos,""ù he said.† UCSB Arts and Lectures hosted Goodell as the first of their four-part ""Earth, Air, Fire, Water""ù public lecture series aiming to highlight voices in environmentalism. Goodell spoke about his newest book, which was appropriately named ""The Heat Will Kill You First""ù for its mid-July release. Although Goodell had no exceptional publishing foresight that this would be the hottest summer on record, he states that, because climate models have predicted global warming for decades, ""it was a good bet that the summer the book came out, whatever summer that would be, was going to be hot.""ù The lecture was followed by an opportunity for audience members to get their copies of the book signed.† Goodell, a native Californian now living in Austin, Texas, has been among the most notable voices in environmental journalism for over 20 years. He has written for numerous publications, including the New York Times and Rolling Stone, where he is a contributing editor. He has appeared as a climate commentator on NPR, CNN and the Oprah Winfrey Show, among many others.† Additionally, Goodell is the author of six books including ""The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, and the Remaking of the Civilized World""ù which was a New York Times Critics Top Book in 2017. Although he took what he calls a ""circuitous path,""ù over the years working as a blackjack dealer, janitor and professional motorcycle racer, to where he is today, he found his calling as an environmental journalist and refers to climate change as ""the most important story of our time.""ù† In addition to the talk on Tuesday evening, Goodell also spoke to approximately five hundred environmental studies students on Tuesday morning. Speaking to the ENVS 1 class, Goodell explained that, even after he understood the concept of heat, he faced another challenge: ""How do you write about it? How do you take this invisible thing, a general thermodynamic force, and turn it into a book that people will care about?""ù In both conversations, Goodell referred to the challenge of striking the delicate balance between instilling fear and inspiring hope in climate communications.† ""I think of my job as a journalist to tell the truth,""ù said Goodell, ""and to tell a story that will move you ""¶ yes, there are scary things in this and that's because what's happening in our world is really scary.""ù† While talking about the title Goodell explained how his editors were initially apprehensive about giving readers such a ""scary""ù first impression. ""One of the problems with talking about climate change is that it seems like it's something that happens far away to other people at other times like future generations and that it's not something that really affects us right now,""ù Goodell said. ""The point of this title was to say that it can kill you.""ù† What humanity has to come to terms with, Goodell said, is that our age of existence within† ""Goldilocks temperature,""ù the regions that are not too hot and not too cold but just right to support the human species, has come to end. ""We're moving into a planet that is not only going to be hotter, there's going to be wetter places, drier places, unpredictable changes,""ù he said.† Nevertheless, Goodell addressed another question he gets frequently: ""Are we doomed?""ù To which he said no.† According to Goodell, our acceptance of this ""new normal""ù is crucial ""î we cannot stop what's imminent, but we are in control of changing all that we can. And in order to do that, the only thing that's going to stop the rising of CO2 levels is our shifting reliance on fossil fuels.† Goodell asserted that he disagreed with the common notion of a climate ""tipping point,""ù saying that he feels it is the wrong way to think about climate change.† ""Every molecule we put into the atmosphere makes it a little bit hotter, every molecule we keep out of the atmosphere prevents it from warming that much,""ù said Goodell. ""There's better and worse scenarios, but there's no tipping point.""ù† Another question Goodell said that he gets a lot is ""What can I do to help fight climate change?""ù Goodell told the audience to ""do what you are good at.""ù Whether that is political activism, scientific research, financial number-crunching, city planning or ""î like those found in ""The Heat Will Kill You First""ù ""î telling powerful stories that motivate people to care, everyone has their own set of skills that can be put to good use.† ""This story is just beginning,""ù Goodell says. ""We're not even at chapter 1 yet.""ù† A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the Oct. 26, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,2023 annular solar eclipse visible from UCSB,26-Oct-23,9:00 AM,['Saanvi Tiwary'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-26/2023-annular-solar-eclipse-visible-from-ucsb/,"The stars aligned over Goleta's Camino Real Marketplace on Oct. 14, putting on a celestial performance that captivated both astronomy enthusiasts and curious onlookers.† The Santa Barbara Astronomical Unit hosted a solar eclipse viewing event in collaboration with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History's Astronomy Programs to provide an educational and safe experience for attendees keen on witnessing the cosmic phenomenon.†† The highlight of the morning was, of course, the solar eclipse, a natural occurrence where the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, temporarily casting a shadow on the Earth. As a consequence of the precise alignment of the Earth, the moon and sun, the moon obscures all or part of the sun's light, casting a surreal twilight across the surroundings. The phenomenon not only showcased the beauty of celestial mechanics but also provided scientists with a valuable opportunity to study the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the solar corona. This specific solar eclipse is known as an ""annular solar eclipse.""ù Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the sun is entirely covered by the moon, this eclipse only covers the center of the sun, leaving the corona (the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere) on full display, creating a brilliant ring of light, known as the ""ring of fire.""ù This will be the last annular solar eclipse until June 21, 2039 that is visible from the United States (minus Alaska.)† Naturally, a solar eclipse is an intriguing phenomenon to many, but just as it is dangerous to look at the sun on a daily basis, it is also unsafe to look at it during an eclipse since the sun's corona is still visible. To ensure safe viewing, organizers offered attendees specially-filtered solar telescopes that provided a close-up view of the eclipse while protecting viewers' eyes, the funds of which supported the museum's day-to-day operations. The event began at 7 a.m. and lasted until noon, allowing attendees to drop by at their convenience and ask astronomy-related questions to experts and astronomers at the scene. The eclipse's main phase began at 8:03 a.m., when the moon started its transit in front of the sun, creating a more shadowy landscape. The peak moment occurred from 9:23-9:25 a.m., revealing a 70% partial eclipse visible from the region that was awe-inspiring to all those in attendance. By 10:48 a.m., the moon had moved entirely out of the sun's path.† Attendees were able to continue their solar observations using telescopes as the weather permitted. The event not only celebrated the marvels of the universe but also emphasized the importance of safe astronomical observation practices, as well as underscored the importance† of community-driven scientific events. Make sure to watch out for the next solar eclipse. Predicted to happen on April 8, 2024, this will be the first total solar eclipse since 2021 and will cross all of North America and will cover the entire sun, making it appear as if it were dusk.

science,Simply Stated: Why do we love true crime?,2-Nov-23,9:00 AM,"['Julia Ringelstein', 'Stella Mullin']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-02/simply-stated-why-do-we-love-true-crime/,"ALLISON HUANG / DAILY NEXUS It starts with a murder. It always starts with a murder (or something along the same lines). Then come the police and detectives and interviews of witnesses, friends, family. And then the ultimate reveal of the killer (or what happened to them if you knew of their identity the entire time). The same cycle over and over, yet we can never stop watching. Why? †True Crime documentaries attempt to make sense of the senseless. Our brains crave this need for understanding now more than ever, with the true crime genre skyrocketing in popularity.† It feels like every few weeks there is a new true-crime documentary coming out on one of the countless streaming services that currently exist. The true-crime genre has grown exponentially in recent years, with Netflix releasing over 65 true-crime documentaries, and about one-third of Americans saying they listen to true-crime podcasts. Stories of serial killers and murderers have also been gaining a large following in recent years.† But why do people choose to watch shows that are based on such unpleasant and unforgivable events? †It is in our nature as humans to ""solve.""ù We've grown up solving puzzles, escape rooms, crosswords and even murder mystery board games. Games like Wordle push us to think deeply and solve a problem. True-crime documentaries provide this same desire to decode a highly complex set of details and make it make sense. Humans are instinctively drawn to solving murder mysteries because it can give us more insight into how to avoid these scenarios and protect ourselves from the evil that exists in society. Studies have shown that when watching disaster or destruction, the amygdala ""î the part of our brain that is responsible for emotions ""î triggers humans to analyze this threat, and that's where our survival instincts kick in. Whether or not this disaster threatens us, our body instinctively continues to stare to face our fears, psychiatrist Dr. David Henderson explains. Viewers that watch true-crime documentaries subconsciously trigger their own fight or flight, questioning what they would do if they were in that situation.† Subsequently, our negativity bias, a cognitive tendency for our brains to feel and learn more from negative events compared to positive ones, results in humans stepping away from the matter gaining knowledge. Humans feel deeper and think harder, therefore, when watching sad or gruesome movies like true-crime documentaries, it not only triggers the audience to empathize and connect with victims, but also to think on our feet and picture oneself in that same situation.† †There are psychological aspects behind every true-crime show that rope viewers in. Studies have shown that most documentaries follow a format, called the Narrative Formula, consisting of three aspects: conflict, evidence and resolution. The Narrative Formula begins by providing a conflict that is followed by clues, interviews and recounts of the act of violence. There may be clips of a forensic scientist discussing some sort of evidence that drew guesses or a local neighbor that tells their perspective. In the case of certain true-crime documentaries where the suspect is known all along, history and background can be given.† Looking back at their upbringing and relationships can give the audience some sort of insight into why this person came to commit such horrific crimes. Viewers can make inferences and try to understand the background, but it is still unknown how, where or what happened. It leaves viewers worried ""î the background of the perpetrator has been given, along with clues and recounts, but justice has yet to be served. It is at this point that most viewers themselves try to ""solve""ù what happened. As the documentary unfolds, and inferences become facts, the Narrative Formula shifts from this state of unknown to this state of hope. This sense of closure and relief provides moral clarity among the audience. †The formula that these documentaries show us is purposefully supposed to be like a roller coaster ride ""î you start off scared and terrified for what's about to come and by the end of it, you are relieved and glad to be secure. It's the adrenaline rush that keeps us wanting to watch more and more true-crime. However, in this case, adrenaline is released in our bodies from the comfort of our own homes while watching a documentary, keeping us at a safe distance from violence. That is what keeps us coming back for more ""î the balance between thrill and comfort. It is just enough to keep us watching without backing down. † For all of you true-crime fanatics, here is a list of media (in no particular order) to satisfy that detective itch: † Widely credited as the best true-crime book, ""Helter Skelter""ù tells the story of the infamous 1969 Manson Murders ""î the investigation, arrest and ultimate prosecution. Author Vincent Bugliosi served as the prosecutor in the 1970 trial of Charles Manson and his book is a first hand recount of his experience with the murderer. The title takes inspiration from Manson's belief in an apocalyptic race war, which he took from the Beatles song ""Helter Skelter.""ù The book received rave reviews, and should be at the top of your ""TCTBR""ù (true-crime to be read.)†† † † 2. ""Criminal Minds""ù Probably the most well-known pop culture crime series, ""Criminal Minds""ù fills 324 hour-long episodes with every murder, kidnapping or assault case you can imagine. It follows the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) and their method of analyzing a crime scene, getting to know a victim, creating a profile and ultimately identifying the unidentified subject), iconically known on the show as the ""unsub.""ù Almost every episode tackles a different case, so if you are looking for something that will keep you glued to the screen, give ""Criminal Minds""ù a watch.† † † 3. ""Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit""ù by John. E Douglas and Mark Olshaker† Retired FBI agent John E. Douglas (along with co-author Mark Olshaker) recounts his 25 years hunting down some of society's most prolific serial killers, taking him across the country from San Francisco to Atlanta. He has done countless research into the killers that have made their way to household names. Douglas is the blueprint for notorious fictional agent Jack Crawford (""The Silence of the Lambs""ù) and his story, published in 1995, is worth the read. It was also adapted into a series available on Netflix.† † † †4. ""In Cold Blood""ù by Truman Capote A true-crime media list would not be complete with Truman Capote's 1966 classic ""In Cold Blood,""ù detailing the four murders of the Clutter family in Kansas in 1959. Before the suspects were identified , Capote learned of the crime and shortly after, traveled to Kansas to write about it, interviewing detectives, neighbors and residents to try to understand what happened. Capote took the following six years to write the true-crime novel, which gained instant success and acclaim, some even regarding it as the first non-fiction novel.† † † † 5. ""Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes""ù † Released on Netflix in 2019, ""The Ted Bundy Tapes""ù quickly rose to popularity. In his mini docuseries, director Joe Berlinger compiles archival footage and audio recordings of Bundy as he awaited execution on death row. The four episodes splice together over 100 hours of interviews ""î both with Bundy and his family and friends ""î to attempt to give a chronological timeline of the killer's life, murders, arrests, trials, escapes and ultimate death.† † † † 6. ""The Thin Blue Line""ù† Regarded as one of the best and most captivating true-crime documentaries, Errol Morris' ""The Thin Blue Line""ù saved an innocent man from death row. An American man named Randall Dale Adams was charged with the 1976 murder of a police officer. Through a combination of art and journalism, Morris exposed irregularities in the case and cleared Adams' name. He takes advantage of reenactments, music and interviews to change the previous narrative. Not only does ""The Thin Blue Line""ù call out the criminal justice system in the United States, but it also paved a new way for documentary filmmaking.†† † † † 7. ""Serial""ù Launched in 2014, ""Serial""ù tells stories of true-crime, spanning from what occurred to the investigation and conviction. Each season tackles a different case. Season one narrates the events surrounding high school senior Hae Min Lee's disappearance, discovery and murder. Season two talks with Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. citizen held in a Taliban prison for almost five years. He was brought home by Obama to planned celebrations, but his arrival was followed by a sudden change in affection by the public and two criminal charges. Season three, the most recent, tells new abnormal stories of seemingly normal cases, all within the four walls of a courthouse. ""Serial""ù is perfect if you are more of a listener ""î it can come with you anywhere.† † † † 8. ""Unsolved Case Files""ù† If all of these options above failed to grasp your attention (maybe you're more of a hands-on type of person), the game ""Unsolved Case Files""ù gives you evidence photos, incident reports, potential suspects and anything else you may need to crack a murder case. You can find these on Amazon, and each one is different ""î do a little digging to find one that finally scratches that detective itch you may be searching for, not in TV or movies or books.

science,"‚""The Future of the Amazon‚""ù: UCSB‚'s Orfalea Center for Global & International Studies hosts international conference",2-Nov-23,9:00 AM,"['Emma Holm-Olsen', 'Olivia Lohrer']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-02/the-future-of-the-amazon-ucsbs-orfalea-center-for-global-international-studies-hosts-international-conference/,"Dozens of scholars, researchers, activists and policymakers from institutions across the globe arrived at UC Santa Barbara for a three-day international conference from Oct. 25-27, aimed at discussing the crucial questions at the heart of geopolitical, economic and environmental futures across the ""Global South,""ù with an emphasis on the Amazon region. The conference, titled ""The Future of the Amazon: A New Era of Indigenous Activism, Post-Carbon Environmental Models, and Latin American Partnerships with China and the Global South,""ù was hosted by the UCSB Orfalea Center for Global & International Studies, which strives to foster discussion of and research on important current events and issues in the Global South/East. Aside from being the first of its kind with regard to the subject matter and international participation, this conference is also the culmination of the efforts of a group of people, many of whom took part in the conference, who for the last five years have been working on a book about China's extensive influence on the Global South, particularly in the Amazon. Titled ""The Tropical Silk Road: The Future of China in South America,""ù the book includes 30 short essays from the perspectives of various Amazonian stakeholders. The book officially launched at the opening of the conference and served as the focus for many of the conversations taking place.† The conference consisted of panels, roundtables, film screenings and several breakout sessions and other opportunities for conference participants to mingle and discuss topics, including Indigenous activism, feminism and queer sovereignty, ""rights of nature,""ù extractivist capitalism and eco-structural futurism, among many other things.† The first panel discussion on Oct. 25, called ""Futures Intersecting: New Indigenous Leadership, Post-Extractive Development Models, and Shifting South-South Geopolitics,""ù opened with a speech by UCSB global studies professor and Director of the Orfalea Center Paul Amar. ""I have no doubt that this research endeavor, the conference and the book will be making history through [the] combination of form and deep content as we engage in dialogue and debate about the issues at hand,""ù Amar said in his opening remarks. The second roundtable discussion focused on ""developmentalist contradiction""ù in the Global South. In introducing the second group of panelists and the subjects they would be discussing, Amar described the term ""Global South""ù and acknowledged it as a contested term, saying it is ""in some ways an air of the term the ""òthird world,' ""¶ meaning the people's world [which] comes from the French.""ù He defined the anti-colonialist alliance between the Global South powers of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) and provided an overview of the ""destructive development model""ù of extractive capitalism in the Global South which the conference would be critiquing.† One of the speakers at this roundtable, and one of the co-authors of ""Tropical Silk Road,""ù was Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro professor Ana Saggioro Garcia, a specialist in international relations and political economy. In her opening statement, Garcia established a few main points she thought were crucial to mention in any discussion of the future of South-South relations, in particular, China's role in Latin America, including the need to move beyond polarized views on supporting extractivist mega-projects. This includes mining and energy production with which China is involved in the Amazon region, versus fighting Western imperialism.† Garcia's own research, and the chapter of the book that she co-wrote, focuses on tracing BRICS investments in Africa and Latin America, the public policies around foreign direct investments (FDI) and public policies to facilitate, promote and protect FDIs, particularly bilateral investment treaties.† ""What are ideas and the narratives around bilateral or Continental relations between China and Latin America?""ù Garcia asked during the conference. ""What we aim to show is that [the] attempt to build consensus on the narratives of South-South solidarity ""¶ face also contradictions when you look at the impacts caused by Chinese multinationals and their investments.""ù She went on to describe various ways of looking at these conflicts, including a top-down view of interstate relations and a bottom-up view of what happens in the individual territories.† The last panel of the conference, on Oct. 26, was titled ""Projects and Partnerships between China and the Amazon Region: Challenges and Opportunities.""ù The panelists, hailing from universities and organizations across the world, focused their discussion on the future of Latin American cooperation with China. The first speaker was Cynthia Sanborn, a professor of political science and political economy at the Universidad del Pac√≠fico in Peru. Sanborn's research centers on the political economy of mining, as well as the challenges of natural resource governance.† In the last 14 years, Sanborn has been studying Chinese companies and investors in Peru's mining sector, and how they fit into the larger sector and interact with other multinational firms. ""The increased presence of China and Chinese actors in [mineral acquisition] sectors has generated considerable debate about what this means in terms of opportunities and challenges for development, especially for the most vulnerable communities within our countries,""ù Sanborn said. ""One of the things I've been focusing on is there are numerous initiatives globally in our region, in our countries and in China, to try to establish standards and limitations on these investments, particularly the extractives initiatives related to transparency and accountability, to our consultation of Indigenous communities, and other environmental and social safeguards.""ù Regarding the relevance to the Santa Barbara community, not only are the world's rainforests simply vital to human existence, but California uses almost half of all of the oil drilled in the Amazon rainforest, according to a recent study, with 1 in 9 tanks of gas in the state coming from the Amazon.†† Claudia Melim-McLeod, the second speaker, is the principal advisor of sustainable finance and China at Rainforest Foundation Norway and the former Senior Climate and National Planning Advisor for the United Nations Development Program. Melim-Mcleod's current work involves being in dialogue with the Chinese financial sector in order to try and reform it in ways that ""go against the very principles of Capitalism,""ù as well as trying to foster discussion on the environment and rights of Indigenous peoples in China. ""My work is not exactly easy, but there are lots of opportunities, and that's what I would like to talk about,""ù Melim-Mcleod said.† Claudia Melim-McLeod speaks at UCSB's Orfalea Center's October 2023 ""The Future of the Amazon""ù conference. EMMA HOLM-OLSEN / DAILY NEXUS She went on to talk about COP-15, the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, the Global Diversity Framework that they established and their relevance to her own work in China ""î including her discussions with both the Chinese government and private companies in China about how they are working to keep the promises they have made with regard to environmental protection and climate change. ""I'm helped by a methodology which was developed at [University of Cambridge] which seeks to quantify nature-related financial loss,""ù Melim-Mcleod said.† She explained that when talking to potential investors, it is important to take into consideration where the companies in question are located geographically, in which ways they might be impacting the environment, whether their company is ""climate ready""ù and whether they depend on things like fertile soil or water. ""This is when you start to look at the things that companies need to operate and continue to make money,""ù Melim-Mcleod said during the conference. ""Then you have the investors' attention because they understand that if they continue to operate in ways that are going to impact the ecosystem's ability to provide services, in 10 years, their shares are not going to be worth very much.""ù The second day of the conference concluded with a screening of the documentary ""Stepping Softly on the Earth""ù in the UCSB MultiCultural Center. The film, released in 2022, was directed by Marcos Col√≥n, who held a Q&A after the screening. The film touches on Amazonian extractivism, particularly its impacts on the Indigenous groups of the region. Col√≥n documents the daily lives of three protagonists ""î K√°tia, chief of the Akr√£tikat√™j√™ people in Brazil, Manoel, chief of the Munduruku people in Brazil and Jos√© Manuyama, a teacher of Kukama origin in Peru ""î as they work to maintain their traditional ways of life despite the encroachment of Western capitalism in the region, specifically the soybean, oil and hydroelectric industries.† In the final few minutes of the film, Brazilian journalist and narrator of the film A√≠lton Krenak emphasized how diverse groups of people have and continue to live with little impact on the land. ""Just as there is citizenship, there is forestship,""ù Krenak said. This is what he calls ""stepping softly on the Earth.""ù† One of the last events of the three-day conference was a screening of the short film ""Terra Vista,""ù produced by Brazilian newspaper and radio agency Brasil de Fato, in conjunction with the Orfalea Center. The film highlights cacao growers in Bah√≠a, a region in Eastern Brazil, and the agroecology work that Brazil's Landless Workers Movement is doing to address poor working conditions and the remnants of colonialism. A conversation with one of the filmmakers, Noa Cykman, a Fulbright scholar and doctoral candidate in UCSB's Department of Sociology, followed the screening.

science,UCSB Lab Studies Emergence and Disease Risk of Mosquito-Borne Viruses,9-Nov-23,9:00 AM,['Katharine Chi'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-09/ucsb-lab-studies-emergence-and-disease-risk-of-mosquito-borne-viruses/,"Andrew MacDonald, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, is leading a team that was awarded a grant from a new USDA grant program that focuses on the impact of extreme weather on food and agricultural systems. As of September 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has recognized the urgency of the growing number of mosquito-borne diseases as large bodies of water are resurfacing after years of droughts, and has subsequently allocated funds for expedited research.† MacDonald is collaborating with researchers from other universities and working on the consolidation of satellite imagery and communication with ground vector control departments. Satellite imagery is used to track the emergence of water bodies on the basis of near real-time. Corresponding with ground vector control departments allows for an additional angle of analysis ""î the observation of how the water is affecting mosquito populations and the diseases associated with the increased growth. The increase in meltwater and rainfall provides mosquitos with more breeding grounds and consequently, an exponential increase in mosquito populations. The cascading events create a trajectory of increased cases of avian-borne diseases such as West Nile, Zika and dengue.† Two central sources of data illustrate the risk of mosquitos: satellite data and ground reports from vector control districts. Satellite programs such as the Landsat Satellite and the Copernicus Sentinel provide data concerning with temperature, precipitation and standing water. Vector control agencies are critical in mitigating mosquito-borne diseases as they monitor mosquito populations and track the spread of pathogens. In addition, the agencies work on population reduction by providing residents with free mosquitofish and treating vulnerable areas with chemicals such as methoprene and bacillus sphaericus. MacDonald's team is working specifically with land data from Kern County in combination with the Land Cover Dataset from the U.S. Geological Survey. With the integration of various land cover datasets, the reliability of the risk assessment and model will increase. Mosquitos are highly adaptable to changes in the environment, but only a select few mosquito species are causes of concern. ""Because mosquitos are ectotherms, they are very sensitive to environmental conditions. They need the temperature to be right, humidity to be high so they don't desiccate, water for breeding and vegetation for resting,""ù MacDonald said in an email to the Nexus, discussing factors influencing mosquito behavior. ""So, those conditions tend to be key in describing patterns of abundance of mosquitoes, and they are all things that we can remotely sense with satellite imagery.""ù† Although adaptable, mosquito breeding behaviors are affected by temperature and the availability of water. The risk model of mosquito-borne diseases relies on the account of these pivotal factors. Birds are also known to be hosts of viruses such as West Nile. Because birds like crows and ravens can dwell in various habitats, the risk of disease is widespread. Viruses can be hosted from outside the classification of mosquitos, which drives researchers to pay attention to various vital factors, especially seasonality and the changes in global climate patterns.† ""The human death toll attributed to malaria alone is by far more than all of the people that have died in all of the wars in human history,""ù MacDonald said in his email to the Nexus. ""That said, diseases like dengue are becoming much more common due to the expansion of the range of the mosquito species that transmit it.""ù The strategy for solutions requires an approach from various aspects. On a large scale, there are action plans such as treating mosquito-breeding sites, but with this comes determining which water bodies will make the greatest impact. On an individual level, one has the ability to incorporate mosquitofish into personal home ponds and the power to control any water sources that could potentially foster mosquito breeding.† In terms of prevention and resolution, both large-scale and individual choices are critical to tackling the rise of mosquito-borne diseases. And because of the efforts of researchers such as MacDonald, there is momentous development in modeling the disease risks as they respond to environmental changes on the scale of real-time. With data-driven awareness and action enacted on both a large and small scale, a communal effort towards the reduction of mosquito-borne diseases will make way for a healthier and brighter future.† Culex mosquitoes: avian-hosted diseases Aedes mosquitoes: tropical diseases† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 9, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,"‚""River Undammed‚""ù: Largest dam removal in history underway, researchers optimistic",9-Nov-23,9:00 AM,['Michael Foley'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-09/river-undammed-largest-dam-removal-in-history-underway-researchers-optimistic/,"On Oct. 30, Alison O'Dowd, professor in the Cal Poly Humboldt Department of Environmental Science and Management and co-director of the River Institute delivered a talk, ""River undammed: Exploring biological responses to Klamath dam removal""ù, as part of the Water Webinar Series ""î a series of webinars hosted by the University of California's Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, which provides a platform for those studying and working on water to network and learn about current California water issues. There is a lot of exciting new research on the horizon and hopes are high for the future of the Klamath River Basin, but, as O'Dowd went on to explain, with the years of activism leading up to this moment, the road here was neither simple nor short.† Decades of hard-fought activism of the Yurok and Karuk tribes have borne fruit in the beginnings of the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The first of four dams to be taken down along the Klamath River was successfully removed in June 2023. Researchers across a wide array of fields are already busy collecting data, working together to monitor the progress of the river's recovery.† Preliminary results give reasons to be hopeful, and as the Klamath River begins to flow freely again for the first time in over a hundred years, indigenous rights activists and researchers alike are eager to see what happens next. Or, as Alison O'Dowd put it, ""A once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch nature recover.""ù† The four dams currently being removed were originally owned and operated by PacifiCorp, an American utilities company owned by 93-year-old billionaire and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company Warren Buffett. During the period in which these dams were being operated, O'Dowd emphasized in her talk that the Yurok, Karuk and other indigenous rights advocates ""have been the main players calling for removal for decades.""ù† They went so far as traveling to Nebraska and even Scotland to protest outside the corporate headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway and prior dam operator Scottish Power. Indigenous peoples have gone to great lengths in demanding justice for the ecological, economic and cultural damage caused by the destruction of the salmon runs their communities rely upon.† As public pressure mounted, an opportunity presented itself in the form of PacifiCorp's license to operate the Klamath dam system expiring in 2004. This expiration initiated a long and hardfought legal battle between PacifiCorp and indigenous rights activists which finally concluded in the Fall of 2020. After 16 years of indigenous-led activism and advocacy, PacifiCorp, the Klamath River Renewal Corporation, the indigenous tribes of the Klamath, a number of environmental and fishing organizations and the states of California and Oregon all agreed to cooperate in the process of pulling down the dams, with PacifiCorp contributing around 200 million dollars in funding and the remaining 250 million in funding coming mostly from state taxes and water bonds.†† While the beginnings of dam deconstruction are a major environmental and cultural victory for the Yurok and Karuk peoples, there is still much work to be done, O'Dowd emphasized, citing the closure of all major fisheries along the Klamath in 2023 due to critical population numbers. The need for thorough investigation and widespread collaboration is as urgent now as it has ever been. 
O'Dowd explains that she got involved in studying the Klamath in February 2020 when a two-day workshop was held allowing experts from across a vast variety of fields to aggregate their findings and organize future collaborations.† On the first day of the workshop, the major takeaways for O'Dowd were from the opportunity to hear from a professor who had worked on a similar dam removal project along the Elwha River, able to use their experience to offer some insight on the question of what to expect after all four dams are gone.† In the case of the Elwha project, it was explained that while it holds some important differences with the Klamath, the most important of which being sheer scale, one thing that was reasonable to expect along the Klamath based on the results of the Elwha was a substantial increase in sediment transport.† Sediment transport is a vital function of any stream due to its role in maintaining and building stable habitats for various aquatic and terrestrial animals and in countering the forces of coastal erosion.†† In the case of the Elwha, a great deal of sediment had built up behind dams causing extensive habitat construction for a number of species. The Elwha also observed significant population recoveries in fisheries and a greater diversity of species being seen further upstream. Overall, the results of the Elwha Dam removal prove very promising for the future of the Klamath River. On the second day of the workshop, a focus group day, O'Dowd met and built a research team.† Their broad objective is to investigate and monitor a number of ecological indicators along the Klamath River. They have picked out four research sites that should allow the team to observe the impacts of the increase in sediment on the ecosystem over a period of five years, 2022 to 2027. This span of time allows the team to analyze and compare conditions before and after dam removal.  
O'Dowd and her colleagues are hoping to track a number of factors over the 5-year period, ranging from her own focus on aquatic invertebrate activity, to water quality, to fish dietary health ""î all in the interest of carefully tracking the recovery progress of the Klamath River. O'Dowd has since run a workshop of her own, in the hope of facilitating the same interdisciplinary collaboration that brought her here in the first place. In closing her talk, O'Dowd cited one of the most important lessons she learned from the Elwha team was the importance of reaching across the lines of discipline and specialization, allowing the vast amount of coordination necessary for a project of this scale to take place. ""Collaborate until it hurts.""ù†† While work is ongoing, O'Dowd stressed the importance in any scientific project of expecting the unexpected. Hopes are high for the future of the Klamath.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 9, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,A warming ocean: What‚'s happening below the surface with the Hofmann Lab?,16-Nov-23,9:00 AM,"['Madasyn Mueller', 'Kat Brydson']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-16/a-warming-ocean-whats-happening-below-the-surface-with-the-hofmann-lab/,"With marine heatwaves facing our oceans as a climate stressor, UC Santa Barbara's Hofmann Lab draws attention to just how drastically marine organisms may change in response.† As a relatively recent phenomenon, marine heatwaves, which are periods of anomalous ocean warming, are profoundly reshaping marine biodiversity along California's coast. From local changes in biodiversity to significant physical changes in the ocean's physical state, the climate change-driven stressor of marine heatwaves is pushing marine life to their limits.† The Hofmann Lab studies global change biology in the local ocean and is headed by principal investigator and interim director of the Marine Science Institute professor Gretchen Hofmann. In her 20 years of residence at UCSB, Hofmann's hierarchical research aim focused on the ecological and economic impact a changing ocean has on organism-environment interactions.† Her lab's goal is to uncover what's happening below the surface and use these findings as a basis to inform decision makers and marine ecosystem managers on mitigating the impacts of the ocean warming crisis. The Nexus spoke with Hofmann about the significant changes occurring below the ocean's surface. With marine heatwaves (MHWs), alongside other climate stressors, predicted to increase in frequency and intensity in the coming decades, the beaches and oceans might feel sterile one day from the climate-driven loss† of biodiversity.† A recent study defines a MHW as a prolonged period of anomalously high seawater temperatures persisting for more than five consecutive days. Anomalously high seawater temperatures are those categorized as 90th percentile relative to local long-term climatology. The phenomenon of MHWs is relatively recent to the scientific community. Researchers only began to record their presence as early as 2013 according to Hofmann; however, their impact on marine ecosystems in the past decade has been profoundly detrimental to biodiversity.""ã""ãThe vitality of the ocean and land are intrinsically linked. According to Hofmann, ocean productivity is responsible for delivering nutrients to support life on beaches.† ""Over time if we lose this, the whole [beach] will feel ""¶ more sterile,""ù Hofmann said regarding ocean productivity.† With a future of empty beaches looming, the Hofmann Lab's research is critical for informing mitigation efforts. In the last several years Hofmann and her team of graduate and postdoctoral students have been comprehensively studying the ecological and economic impacts of MHWs in California's marine ecosystem. The Hofmann Lab's research alongside others has shown that MHWs are pushing cold-blooded organisms to their thermal limits, causing species range shifts, impacting reproductive success and exacerbating disease outbreaks.† Professor Gretchen Hofmann holds up an urchin. Courtesy of UCSB. During MHWs, some organisms are affected disproportionately. Sessile organisms, which are those fixed in one place, cannot escape MHWs. Whereas mobile organisms, such as fish and some marine invertebrates, can migrate poleward to cooler waters. Under the thermal stress of MHWs, entire populations of mobile species sometimes leave, while sessile species populations drastically decline locally. Combined, these MHW effects are restructuring ecosystem dynamics often in significantly negative ways, yet the long term ecological impacts of MHWs are still largely unknown. To encapsulate this issue, Hofmann says that ""climate change is shaking up the biodiversity puzzle of our coasts.""ù A MHW, most notably known as ""the Blob,""ù struck the northeastern Pacific Ocean in 2014, with anomalously high seawater temperatures for 711 days. In that time, coastal researchers throughout the Pacific documented the mass mortalities of crucial mammal and bird species due to the Blob. In the local Santa Barbara region, research from the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) shows that MHW-induced declines and changes in species composition have persisted for nearly six years post-blob.† Even now, when speaking about the† long-term impacts of the Blob, Hofmann said that † there can be a shift in biodiversity.† Since the Blob, Hofmann says the Santa Barbara region has seen MHWs in the years 2018, 2020 and again this past summer.† To better understand MHWs as an emerging phenomena, the lab collaborates with SBC LTER to detect changes in both ocean surface and floor temperature. The data indicate MHWs affect all levels of the water column, spanning from the surface to the benthic floor, which motivates many of the lab's current research efforts on marine invertebrates.† Erin de Leon Sanchez is one of the graduate students working in the Hofmann lab on this project. Courtesy of Gretchen Hofmann. Some of the lab's most recent research explores the impact of MHWs on the economically and ecologically important red urchin and Kellet's whelk sea snail species. The lab also focuses on how MHWs affect the fertilization and different life stages of invertebrates such as the purple urchin in addition to their plasticity. In the context of their research, plasticity refers to the capacity of a species ability to respond to environmental stress.† A former doctoral student in Hofmann's lab, Xochitl Clare, found that under MHW conditions, the larvae of the Kellet's whelk exhibited significant developmental abnormalities. Clare's research implies that MHWs have the potential to cause population decline of Kellet's whelk locally, a detriment to the aquaculture industry. Another study, conducted in the Hofmann Lab by former doctoral student Juliet Wong, indicates there is a significant link between the alteration of gene expression and increased temperature in the development of red urchin.† As an economically significant species, red urchins are primarily harvested for their roe. The alteration of red urchin development from MHWs could potentially have a negative impact on the aquaculture industry of uni. Another species studied by the Hofmann Lab is the purple urchin, an integral species in maintaining the equilibrium in California's kelp forests. Research from the Hofmann Lab suggests that under MHW conditions, the purple urchins have a smaller, more variable body size in development compared to normal temperatures.† This phenotypic change was found to be inherited by purple urchin offspring suggesting that thermal stress has the potential to shift species morphology on a short timescale.† In the face of MHWs, the lab found purple urchins have lower reproductive success, however, their plasticity to thermal stress exhibits the species' potential resilience to MHWs.† With the element of uncertainty that† MHWs are bringing to oceans ecologically, research like Hofmann's Lab is critical to understanding the changes below the surface.† ""[The lab's current research is] telling us a story that the ocean is changing and that we should start to care immediately,""ù she said.† But for Hofmann, finding a solution is not exactly the right term. Instead, according to Hofmann, scientists and policymakers need to adjust and mitigate in response to the current ocean warming crisis. Hofmann meets this challenge with optimism. †""We've got a lot of fight in us. There are a lot of ideas that can be leveraged""¶ Mother Nature has a lot of resilience,""ù she said. †For the rest of her research career, Hofmann aims to focus on how thermal stress affects the vast California kelp forests and their organisms, which are just a few hundred yards away from her lab.† A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the Nov. 16, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,UCSB Decarbonization Study Project Committee launches clean energy master plan,16-Nov-23,9:00 AM,['Sierra Ferrante'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-16/ucsb-decarbonization-study-project-committee-launches-clean-energy-master-plan/,"In a virtual kickoff meeting, UC Santa Barbara's Decarbonization Study Project Committee launched its official campus Clean Energy Master Plan.† The initiative is a joint effort of both UCSB officials and Introba, a third-party, worldwide engineering consulting firm who will be lending support to the technical side of decarbonization. The committee is co-led by Ren√©e Bahl and Susannah Scott, with representatives from Introba serving as project managers.† Decarbonization is nothing new for the UC system. In 2013, the UC system announced a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2025, but this new initiative represents a shift to a different goal: 90% decarbonization by 2045. The key change in the new plan is eliminating a majority of the carbon offsets that the previous plan relied on to reach its goal.† The meeting, on Oct. 25, provided a summary of where UCSB currently stands with regard to† its goals. The university has already managed to reduce its carbon footprint by about two-thirds, and UCSB now generates 15% of electricity on-site through renewable means, primarily solar panels.† Purchased electricity has come from carbon-free sources since 2020. The project team believes UCSB has a few key advantages compared to the other UCs when it comes to decarbonizing. The campus has a newer power grid, rebuilt less than 20 years ago, and a relatively flat campus geography.† Additionally, even now, UCSB is the only UC with no cogeneration, meaning there is no onsite power plant. Many climate plans break down total emissions into three scopes, numbered 1-3.† Scope 1 includes things like heating and cooling of buildings, water heating and many other activities often powered by natural gas. Scope 2 emissions are from purchased electricity, meaning it is not generated on-site, but is created as a result of an organization's activity. Scope 3 is any other emissions not covered by Scopes 1 and 2.† The biggest challenge that UCSB faces is Scope 1. However, the school is working with Introba to develop innovative ways of achieving these things while still reducing emissions.† One such example is ""thermal storage,""ù which would use the same energy that makes hot water for showers to cool buildings simultaneously, thereby reducing overall energy requirements.† Both the Introba and UCSB representatives reiterated that the ""the University of California system is a recognized leader in equity-centered climate action planning,""ù and intends to make sure that the plan moves forward in an equity-centered framework.† The time from now until June 2024 will primarily be a period for more studies and public comment, with any actual construction commencing after that period.† The public input and comment period will have a variety of ways for stakeholders and community members to get involved, and the committee emphasized their commitment to hearing input from the public.† While exact dates have not yet been announced, there will be town halls held throughout the comment period open to any students or community members, as well as smaller meetings with key stakeholders.† For students or community members looking to send in feedback at any point, the committee has set up an email account, decarb@ucsb.edu, which will be monitored for open feedback throughout the comment period.† They encourage any individual with ideas, suggestions or concerns to reach out through the email, as well as attend public comment sessions. A final important subject addressed in the meeting was the importance of equity when determining the process of decarbonization at UCSB.† Although an important step for protecting the planet, both Introba and the project committee understand that these changes have far-reaching implications for the university and surrounding communities. The study's team reaffirmed their commitment and understanding of the importance of community involvement in addressing any such concerns.† † The Clean Energy Master Plan has 5 major considerations:† † A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the Nov. 16, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,A conversation with SB Channelkeeper on the legal battle against nitrate pollution,20-Nov-23,9:00 AM,['Michael Foley'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-20/a-conversation-with-sb-channelkeeper-on-the-legal-battle-against-nitrate-pollution/,"Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, an organization with the mission of protecting and restoring local water resources, has joined a broad coalition of environmentalists, fishing organizations and Latinx and farmworker community groups in a lawsuit against the California State Water Resources Control Board, challenging their decision to deprioritize nitrate pollution. This past September, a regulatory order which included various measures to protect against nitrate pollution, known as Ag Order 4.0, was repealed and remanded by the Water Board after undergoing legal pressure from a number of agricultural organizations in early October. The Daily Nexus spoke to the executive director of Santa Barbara Channelkeeper (SBCK), Ted Morton: What could you tell us about your history with water quality? How did you come to care about these issues? Morton: ""When I graduated from law school 30 years ago, I moved to Washington DC and began working for American Oceans Campaign, a non-profit conservation organization. My first assignments were connected to the Clean Water Act regulations and legislation ""ì specifically beach water quality, estuary protection, and stormwater pollution prevention.""ù ""Clean, safe, and reliable water is essential for life. It is imperative that there are effective programs and laws to protect water quality for communities and wildlife.""ù What would you consider to be some of the most important implications of nitrate pollution in regard to ecological and human health?† Morton: ""A leading source of nitrate pollution in California is irrigated agricultural operations. The over-application of nitrate fertilizer on these lands is a significant issue. The Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board found that nitrogen from fertilizer is the primary cause of ""widespread and severe groundwater nitrate contamination observed in the central coast region.""ù Communities of color are experiencing high nitrate levels in both ground and surface waters. The Central Coast Regional Board sampled 2600 on-farm wells throughout the region and found that 28 percent exceeded the water quality standard for nitrates.""ù ""Nitrate consumption is especially dangerous for infants and pregnant women. It can contribute to ""blue baby syndrome.""ù It also can cause cancer and thyroid disease in adults.""ù ""Nitrate pollution can also contribute to toxic algal blooms in surface waters.""ù What groups of people are being the most impacted by nitrate and agricultural pollution? Morton: ""Farmworkers and communities of color, particularly in the Salinas Valley, Gilroy-Hollister Valley, and Santa Maria River Valley area, must contend with contaminated water supplies that threaten their health and require them to find alternative and often unaffordable water supply for drinking and other basic needs.""ù How does the impact of nitrate and agricultural pollution differ between surface and groundwater systems?† How does the extent of the impact and the clean up process differ between the two? †Morton: ""Many surface waters along the Central Coast have been designated as impaired due to excessive nitrate pollution. These waterbodies should be priorities for pollution prevention and reduction. Key issues from nitrate contamination of rivers, streams, and other surface waters include harmful algal blooms, limitations for recreation, and impairment of fish and wildlife habitats.""ù† ""Groundwater supplies are also significantly affected by nitrates leaching through the soil. Once nitrate fertilizer application levels are reduced to levels that protect public health, it is estimated that it could take additional decades for the groundwater to be safe again for drinking and other public uses.""ù† How well do you feel the original Ag Order 4.0 addressed the ecological and health concerns associated with nitrate pollution?† †Morton: ""The Central Coast Regional Board's Ag Order 4.0 contained a few strong measures to address nitrate pollution. The most significant one was to require a subset of growers who are excessively applying nitrate fertilizer to abide by hard numeric limits. This would have increased accountability and focused efforts on those growers who are more significantly contributing to the problem. Unfortunately, the State Water Resources Control Board struck this measure down in its September decision.""ù ""Although finding that surface waters were being contaminated by nitrates and pesticides, the Central Coast Regional Board's Ag Order 4.0 did not include additional requirements for use of vegetated buffers between the edge of fields and nearby rivers, streams, and creeks that can reduce nitrate and pesticide pollution and provide habitat for wildlife.""ù Claire Wineman, president of Grower-Shipper Association of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties was quoted in the Sun as saying that the remanded order ""more appropriately balances ongoing improvements and advancements with real world constraints.""ù Do you agree with this assessment? What is your perspective on Ag Order 4.0 and its regard for real world constraints?† Morton: ""It is important to protect the health of farmworkers and their families from the public health impacts of agricultural pollution. A more effective Ag Order 4.0 would make significant, meaningful steps in this direction.""ù What would it mean for your team and the other organizations you've partnered with to win this lawsuit? Morton: ""Success in the lawsuit would drive stronger and more effective regional and statewide actions to protect farmworker communities and water quality from nitrate fertilizer and pesticide pollution.""ù In addition to their current work on agricultural pollution, SBCK is continuing its efforts in community outreach with programs such as Board Walks""îhikes aimed at building awareness of and engagement with local water sources ""îand its Marine Protected Area (MPA) Watch volunteer programs. SBCK is also continuing its work in Indigenous rights advocacy, as evidenced by their recent attendance at ""Rally at The Rock,""ù supporting the inclusion of an important Sacred Heritage Site for the Chumash community within the boundaries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

science,"Simply Stated: Do ‚""guilt-free‚""ù prebiotic drinks actually make you healthier?",22-Nov-23,3:00 PM,['Leah Cierzan'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-22/simply-stated-do-guilt-free-prebiotic-drinks-actually-make-you-healthier/,"Have you found yourself grabbing a poppi or Olipop prebiotic drink from the Arbor before class, reassured with the probiotic labeling, or adding that free ""gut health""ù supplement into your Blenders In The Grass smoothie of choice? You're not alone; the concept of improving your gut health is becoming more popular every day. Companies such as poppi and Olipop are two popular brands with prebiotic soda alternatives. Founded by a couple from Texas in 2016, poppi was able to grow its roots with an investment from the popular entrepreneur show ""Shark Tank.""ù Since then, the company has been able to fill shelf space in retail stores nationwide. The drink is a popular pick for people craving a guilt-free ""full-of-flavor soda with benefits""ù or for those wanting the benefits of gut-healthy ingredients such as apple cider vinegar without the harsh taste. The main ingredients in poppi's prebiotic soda drinks are agave inulin prebiotics, apple cider vinegar and fruit juice concentrates. Consumers often think that foods with fewer ingredients are healthier, and companies like poppi cash in on this ""clean ingredient""ù craze.† But do they actually make your gut healthy? To fully understand the components of a healthy gut, it is important to consider the difference between prebiotics and probiotics. Mayo Clinic defines probiotics as foods that contain microorganisms that help to maintain the ""good""ù bacteria in the body, which allows for the body to absorb nutrients more smoothly. Similarly, prebiotics are described as being used to improve the balance and health of these microorganisms. The specific source of prebiotics in poppi drinks is agave inulin, which is a type of prebiotic derived from the agave tequilana plant. Prebiotics are necessary to maintain the health of our gut microbiomes because they provide our digestive systems with nutrients that can be broken down into fatty acids. According to the National Library of Medicine, prebiotics are broken down into short-chain fatty acids that are released into the bloodstream. This allows for the effects of these prebiotics to affect not only the digestive tract but also other organs in the body, incorporating sources of prebiotics.† While these ""healthy soda drinks""ù likely will do no harm, drinking exclusively these prebiotic sodas is not going to heal your gut alone. Professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Hannah Holscher says dietary fiber is one of the key components to a healthy gut. High-fiber foods such as beans, fruits and vegetables allow the body to regulate our gut microbiota and digestive tracts. The two types of fiber are soluble and insoluble fiber, both of which have important roles in regulating the digestive tract. Soluble fiber absorbs water and transforms into a gel that is then consumed by gut bacteria. Insoluble fiber stays intact throughout the digestive tract and adds bulk to stool. Both types aid in the regulation of keeping your digestive tract running smoothly, and many experts like Holscher believe that the more diverse a diet you maintain, the more healthy your gut will be.† In addition to fiber, there are many other types of foods that can assist in maintaining a healthy gut including, but not limited to, probiotics, seeds, nuts and overall a diverse and nutrient-dense diet. If you are drinking poppi to improve your gut health, it is important to consider making vaster changes to your diet holistically. In short: poppi and other prebiotic sodas come with real benefits but are not an all-in-one solution to healing your gut health.

science,Simply Stated: Do we really have free will?,30-Nov-23,9:00 AM,"['Cassie Cruz', 'Cassandra Cavallo']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-30/simply-stated-do-we-really-have-free-will/,"When you decided to read the Science & Tech section of the Daily Nexus today, was it really a choice? Or is this action, and every action you have ever taken, predetermined? Hard determinists would say you never had a choice against this fate.† Hard determinism is the concept that humans do not have free will but, instead, are a mere product of genetic, environmental and unconscious factors outside of one's control. The philosopher Ren√© Descartes, who you may know by his famous quote, ""I think, therefore I am,""ù concluded that humans are conscious by using a thought experiment in which an evil demon could manipulate him into doubting the existence of his senses and the things he thought he knew about the external world.† After all, psychology tells us that sensory experiences do not put us in direct contact with the world around us but rather connect the sensory input we receive to the map of the world that our brain is constantly building.† Descartes concluded, however, that the one thing the demon could never do is trick his mind into thinking he didn't exist because doing so would require existence itself. Therefore, Descartes concluded that if every part of his body could be fooled except his conscious mind, then his conscious mind must irrefutably exist.† However, many scientists, philosophers, and even UC Santa Barbara faculty, believe that you can possess free will without having consciousness at all. Social psychologist Daniel Wegner's theory on the illusion of free will suggests that our choices might not be as autonomous as they seem because underlying processes in the brain make decisions before we are consciously aware of them.† Scientist Benjamin Libet performed a study in 1984 that provided support for this theory. Libet had participants press a button while he compared the time at which participants reported being consciously aware of deciding to move with the time brain activity associated with movement was sensed through scalp electrodes. The results showed that the brain signaling correlated to movement was actually sensed 350 milliseconds before the conscious decision to move was reported. Libet's study suggests that our brain may decide to act before we are even consciously aware of it.† So, if we may not have free will, why do we think we do? In 2008, UCSB psychological & brain sciences professor and researcher Jonathan Schooler conducted a study examining the relationship between the belief in free will and ethical behavior. The study found that messages discouraging belief in free will resulted in a greater tendency to cheat on a self-graded exam, indicating a potential link between our beliefs about free will and our moral behavior. Schooler's study leaves us questioning whether the idea that the mere belief that we have free will may have evolved to encourage prosocial behavior.† Even if the belief in free will has value, does anything really matter if we don't have free will in the first place? Is there any evidence that points to us having any power against a predetermined fate? The answer to this question may actually be in the physics of the fundamental units that make up our universe.† By the nature of quantum physics, what happens to the universe at microscopic levels is unpredictable and cannot be described in a deterministic way. This phenomenon is observed through the famous double-slit experiment, which concludes that the behavior of quantum particles is unpredictable and can actually simultaneously take multiple paths at once, in which they are in what is known as a superposition state. It is known that on large scales, quantum effects are not observed, like how we tend not to see a student walking through two different entrances of a physics classroom at the same time. However, there has been evidence suggesting quantum effects play a role in certain functions of living beings, such as in the quantum mechanics of migratory bird magnetic navigation or plants' synthesis of sugars. LAUREN BRYANT / DAILY NEXUS Evidence is beginning to surface pointing to quantum effects on the human brain, leading some physicists to entertain the idea that consciousness and free will could emerge from quantum processes. Physicist and UCSB physics professor Matthew Fisher argues that phosphorus nuclei in the brain may have a quantum spin that allows for a type of superposition, called an entangled state, that can last long enough for human brain processes to occur. However, even if the brain does function at a quantum level, there is still work to be done to connect the quantum indeterminacy of brain processes to proof of humans' free will. And so, the question as to whether we really possess free will, or whether it is just an illusion, remains. In this investigation, because of the ever-evolving nature of our understanding of consciousness and free will, you must weigh all the currently available evidence and ultimately decide for yourself.† So, did you really have any choice in reading this free will expos√©? Maybe not. But on the off chance that the hard determinists had it all wrong and we do in fact have free will, try to stay honest while taking your exams this finals season ""¶ even if the evil demon on your shoulder tells you otherwise.† A version of this article appeared on page 11 of the Nov. 30 print edition of the Daily Nexus.†

science,Simply Stated: Which genre reigns supreme for your perfect study soundtrack?,4-Dec-23,9:55 AM,['Tanvi Ladha'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-12-04/simply-stated-which-genre-reigns-supreme-for-your-perfect-study-soundtrack/,"As final exams creep closer, are you finding yourself wondering about how to improve the effectiveness of your study habits? Many people listen to music while they study, and when midterms come around, the genre people often choose to ease them into study mode is† peaceful, classical music. The lack of words and the soothing orchestral sounds seem to match the focused vibe. But are Wolfgang Mozart's sonatas enough to help you crush your exam? Are there better options out there? †Some may say EDM or techno are preferable, others prefer pop and a rare few may opt for hard rap ""î everyone has different favorites for their study soundtrack. †Music has the potential to maximize learning. It activates both the left and right hemispheres of the brain at the same time and has been proven to reduce anxiety and blood pressure, as well as improve sleep, mood, memory and mental alertness. †Background music can also have an impact on different attentional states and performance. A 2020 study collected subjective reports of various attentional states ""î including mind-wandering, task-focus and external distraction ""î and measures of reaction time on certain tasks.† Participants were either tested with silence or with their self-selected preferred background music. The results showed that their music choice increased the proportion of task-focus states by decreasing mind-wandering states. This means that their brain took a more focused state, and any wandering states were less likely to occur. The music did not affect external distraction states, meaning that if you were sitting in a noisy environment or surrounded with talkative people, listening to music may not have been enough to help you focus. †Although the findings showed that an individual's preferred music can enhance task-focused states, this conclusion is limited to low-demanding attention tasks. So, it isn't a given that listening to your favorite artist will give you photographic memory powers while studying for that final.† Nevertheless, listening to your preferred music can help focus your mind and quiet internal distraction (No promises regarding outside influences!). †Another tip for creating study playlists is to look at the familiarity of the music. Since music decreases stress and cortisol levels, it helps the brain work without interruption. These regions of the brain are connected to the regions that process emotion. Certain music can put us in touch with specific memories or emotions, which, according to Srini Pillay, a Harvard psychiatrist and brain researcher, makes us ""emotionally volatile.""ù This can be used to our advantage to help us think clearly but can also hurt us if it causes negative emotions to linger and take over our thoughts, distracting us from the task at hand. †All in all, if you're a music lover and it helps your mental state, then it is best you don't forget your headphones as you head to the library to study for finals. National University's blog focuses on providing information and aid to people navigating school and career opportunities; according to a recent blog post of theirs, which references sources such as the American Psychological Association and Psychology Today, claims that classical music, ambient sounds, nature sounds, electronic music, lo-fi hip-hop, jazz and film or game soundtracks are the most popular study-music choices. But, if you want a playlist curated to match your vibe, here are some tips when choosing songs: † ""ì †  Tempo: music with 60-70 beats per minute has been proven to help students retain information ""ì †  Sound control: don't let the volume of the music overpower you; be able to hear yourself think clearly ""ì †  Lyrics: if the lyrics make you want to get up on the table and belt your heart out or make you want to contemplate life instead of study, it might not be the best choice ""ì †  Commercials and ads: ads and chatter can break your focus. Maybe find a radio station with commercial free music! † No mind is alike. Create a playlist that matches you and your needs, but make sure you like what you're listening to. And if silence is your preferred background noise, that works too! Find what works for you before finals approach so you can be ready to hit the books with the perfect playlist. † † † †

science,UC Santa Barbara faculty take part in United Nations Plastics Treaty negotiation,18-Dec-23,9:13 AM,"['Qien Feng', 'Isabelle Kang']",https://dailynexus.com/2023-12-18/uc-santa-barbara-faculty-take-part-in-united-nations-plastics-treaty-negotiation/,"UC Santa Barbara's Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory recently joined the United Nations in making historic progress toward a plastic-free world. Over 175 countries around the globe convened in Nairobi, Kenya on Nov. 13 for the third part of a five-session debate to discuss the terms of a global, legally binding Plastics Treaty.† The call for a globally binding agreement toward combating plastic pollution was first initiated in 2017 by an Expert Group from the United Nations Environment Assembly. In September 2023, the zero draft was published, providing a list of proposed plans for use in the following Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) session. A deadlock was reached after a week of negotiations on November 20, as a few countries remained wary of the treaty's repercussions.† Among the presenters in the United Nations Environment Programme assembly was Nivedita Biyani, a postdoctoral researcher in UC Santa Barbara's Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory. In collaboration with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and UC Berkeley's Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science & Environment, Biyani and her team developed a novel, interactive AI model that combines predictive analytics and innovative graphic design to deliver an impactful message about the state of our plastic footprint in 2050.† This AI model features an interactive guide that allows viewers to select a treaty policy outcome and directly visualize its impacts. Under a ""business as usual""ù scenario, the amount of plastic generated between 2010 and 2050 ""î 3.19 billion metric tons ""î would tower over Manhattan in a pile 3.5 kilometers high.† This project was built upon the historic data set by Roland Geyer, a professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, which contains all known plastic production from 1950 to 2020. Douglas McCauley, a professor in UCSB's Department of Ecology, Evolution, & Marine Biology, reached out to Geyer regarding the possibility of further utilizing the data set in projecting future estimated plastic waste. McCauley formed a research team ""î Biyani being one of them ""î who worked together to complete the model over the course of eight months.† One question raised by the interactive model from the negotiation is how plastic and waste measurement will change in different regions of the world. While the current answer lies in the lack of data, Biyani points out that the model complements what other presenters have brought to the panel and hopes that the cumulative data can help to appease dissenters.† ""I look forward to more collaborative signs being done in this space, where we get to answer the questions that concern every country,""ù she said. A screenshot from the interactive model developed by UCSB and UCB researchers, illustrating potential future plastic waste scenarios in the city of Manhattan. Courtesy of UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley. Still, there is opposition to the treaty. Although the solution to this environmental crisis may seem clear, Biyani maintains that it is not so simple. ""Whether it's a building, clothes or packaging, plastic has allowed us to produce at an enormous [and] cheap scale,""ù Biyani said. ""Are we ready to say goodbye to that scale? What would be the cost? That is really the question being asked.""ù Many countries that rely on petroleum products are concerned the treaty would negatively impact employment and the wellbeing of their economy.† Biyani suggests that since the goal of reducing plastics is universal, this could act as the foundation for countries to build upon. Every nation involved needs to be on the same page in order to move forward.† ""One thing that every country could agree on is that they don't want plastics in the larger environment as pollution,""ù Biyani said. ""No matter which country or delegation, they all unanimously agreed.""ù† Biyani urges higher authorities and corporations to find ways to minimize the burden of plastic pollution on regular consumers.† ""The mother of three kids, the nurse, the fire fighter, the hard working academics ""¶ they don't really have the time to think about their plastic usage,""ù she said.† Biyani believes that creating a globally binding policy is one of the solutions to improve the destructive plastic management system.† †Despite this impasse, Biyani remains hopeful.† ""I think the fact that all the countries were there and represented in INC-3 and the previous INCs means that they're concerned and are willing to talk. So there's a huge momentum behind this, and I definitely think the outcome of that momentum is positive.""ù† The following two INC sessions are tentatively scheduled in Ottawa, Canada and Seoul, South Korea in 2024. While Biyani and her team work toward pushing the treaty past its deadlock, in the meantime she has some advice about what the UCSB community can do to make an impact:† ""Spread the word about the [model], contact your legislators to make sure they are voicing your opinion during this treaty and be aware of your carbon footprint.""ù

science,Simply Stated: Why do holiday lights make us happy?,23-Dec-23,5:51 PM,['Isabelle Kang'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-12-23/simply-stated-why-do-holiday-lights-make-us-happy/,"A walk around Isla Vista during the month of December reveals the community glowing under holiday lights and decorations. From the shining Christmas tree on Embarcadero del Norte and Pardall Road to the cozy string lights in Woodstock's Pizza to Delta Tau Delta's inflatable Santas, these annual decorations never fail to spark excitement for students.† Despite the gloomy weather settling in, seeing the warm glow of menorahs, kinaras and string lights fill us with warmth and comfort. What about holiday lights bring so much joy?† One possible explanation is chromotherapy, or color therapy, which is the use of colored light to improve mental health and mood. Color therapy is based on the assumption that exposure to different colors results in different health outcomes. For example, red light is thought to energize and green light is thought to relieve stress. Although opposite in their benefits, both colors work in harmony to help its viewers refresh and relax. This color combination not only makes for a festive garland but also creates a mood-boosting cocktail of colors.† Alternatively, psychologists suggest a deviation from the everyday routine may also signal a positive neurological shift. Whether it be picking up a new holiday drink, setting up holiday decor or lighting the kinara, this special month of festivities can improve cognitive abilities, alleviate anxiety and prevent burnout ""î fortunately coming at a time when college students are running on two hours of sleep and a Red Bull.† But perhaps the most reasonable explanation is nostalgia. Holiday decorations spark so much joy because of the fond memories we attach to them: homework-free nights snuggling under a warm blanket with a steaming mug of hot chocolate in your childhood home while surrounded by the soft yellow glow of the menorah or stockings lining the fireplace and your favorite Christmas movie playing in the background. As you reunite with family and loved ones, life's stressors seem to be put on pause until after the new year. Even if the Thanksgiving turkey has just barely cooled, catching a glimpse of any set of holiday lights means those blissful weeks of break and family and friends are here.† Cozy Christmas decor at Woodstock's Pizza.

There is one group of students who know exactly what happens to this food waste after mealtime: the Associated Students (A.S.) Department of Public Worms (DPW). Founded in 2004 as an offshoot of the A.S. Recycling group, these students are passionate about composting and sustainable agriculture practices. DPW began its partnership with UC Santa Barbara's residential dining commons in 2012. In 2019, their operations further expanded with the establishment of the DPW Farm on west campus. ""We have a great relationship with the dining commons, and I think a lot of it has to do with consistency,""ù said A.S. Garden Coordinator Marla Greer. ""They know what to expect from us, and they do their best to provide good quality material for our operations. We check in with them quarterly, but the students are really the ones getting the face time with the kitchen staff.""ù† Every morning, a group of DPW students ""î referred to as the ""worm wranglers""ù ""î go to the dining halls to search through those big green bins.† ""We go in the mornings, as they're prepping the food for the day,""ù Greer said. ""We've got grabbers and gloves [because] it's definitely a dirty job to hand-sort and pick out things from their green bins and put them in our bins.""ù† DPW is particular about what they can take. They primarily collect pre-consumer food waste, meaning food waste that has not been on somebody's plate. Most of this is the ""back of house""ù byproducts accumulated during meal preparation, like the inedible part of any fruit or vegetable that gets chopped off. They can take any produce items as well as other organic products such as eggshells, coffee grounds and tea bags. They avoid oil-based products (like salad dressings), animal products that could contaminate the pile, ""compostable""ù plastic items and breads, which are technically compostable but take longer than the other items.†† After selecting what they need from the dining commons, the worm wranglers load their bounty into the DPW all-electric vehicle that they are trained to drive as they commute between their various sites. The first stop for the food waste is ""The Grove,""ù an on-campus composting site behind Harder Stadium.† Two types of composting occur at The Grove: thermophilic and vermicompost. Thermophilic means that the temperature of the pile rises as microorganisms actively decompose its contents. After the food waste is dumped, a layer of mulch is added on top and the pile is sprayed with water to ensure moisture. The worm wranglers will measure the temperature of the pile until it hits the target temperature of 130 F, when it will be remixed and left to sit until it warms up again. This process is typically repeated three times or until the remaining food scraps are unrecognizable. The pile is sifted and what remains is fine but highly nutrient-dense soil to be worked into the crop beds at the DPW Farm.† ""Hot compost""ù at the Grove. OLIVIA LOHRER / DAILY NEXUS Additional nutrients come from the vermicompost, also called the worm compost. Located on the other side of the grove are two large wooden structures. Upon first glance, they look to be full of dirt, newspapers and a few fruit scraps. Closer inspection, however, reveals that these boxes are teeming with life. Worms work all day to digest and decompose what's hand-selected by the wranglers to fit their taste. ""Worms are picky eaters,""ù Greer said. ""They're not gonna want anything spicy or acidic so as we're collecting food scraps we're also sorting for what the worms like to eat, like leafy greens, apples, bananas, juicy melons. Everything else goes into hot compost.""ù These wooden bins have been home to many generations of worms. They were originally built and placed around Isla Vista, and DPW would manage the organic food waste of local restaurants before the arrangement with UCSB Dining. Right now, they are in the midst of renovation.† ""We're restoring them, changing the hardware so that we can get many more years out of the structures themselves,""ù Greer said. When the worms break down the organic waste, they produce worm castings ""î essentially worm manure that acts as a sort of superfood for plants. Highly concentrated, the castings are mixed with water to brew what Greer refers to as ""worm tea.""ù The worm tea is then taken to the DPW farm to boost the microbiological activity within the soil.† The soil in The Grove's worm bins is teeming with life. OLIVIA LOHRER / DAILY NEXUS Anybody visiting the DPW farm on a tour are likely to witness produce growing so that it can later be supplied to the A.S. Food Bank. As of now, Greer said that students can expect to see goods from the farm at the food bank biweekly.† ""Right now, things are still small on the farm, but our summer harvests were really delicious and abundant,""ù Greer said. ""We had things like tomatoes, cucumbers, so many beans, lots of peppers.""ù This time of year, you can find things like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, onions, radishes and carrots on the farm. If this food goes unclaimed at the food bank, it returns to The Grove as organic food waste to be composted alongside the dining hall scraps. Greer discussed the notion of a ""closed loop""ù that is central to DPW's mission. ""It's about keeping it all in a loop,""ù she said. ""Any produce that's grown at the farm is donated to the food bank, any food that is not picked up can come back to us, we'll compost it and, when that's complete, we take that back to the farm and use it to grow more food. We're not losing any of the nutrients throughout the cycle.""ù† This is not the only closed loop that DPW operates. In addition to working with campus dining and the A.S. Food Bank, they also manage the two Family Student Housing (FSH) Community Gardens, with 30 plots at West Campus FSH and 60 plots at Storke FSH. Residents of FSH can give their food scraps to DPW, who will compost it and give the nutrients back to them for their community gardens.† In one year of operation, from the beginning of fall 2022 to the end of summer 2023, the Department of Public Worms diverted 15144.85 pounds of food waste from landfills, according to their records.† ""I think it's important to keep in mind that although DPW diverts a small fraction of food waste generated at UCSB, it's all kept on site,""ù Greer said. Furthermore, she noted that ""it's really [just] twelve dedicated students""ù who manage that amount of food waste throughout the school year. ""On one level, it's just about being connected to your local food systems,""ù Greer said regarding why she feels DPW is important to the UCSB campus. ""You feel connected to the process, to the Earth, to the people involved. Sharing that experience is valuable and DPW tries to do a lot of outreach and education and give other people opportunities to learn.""ù

science,UCSB‚'s iCTF security competition celebrates 20 years,31-Dec-23,9:36 AM,['Tanvi Ladha'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-12-31/ucsbs-ictf-security-competition-celebrates-20-years/,"UC Santa Barbara's International Capture the Flag (iCTF) hacking competition celebrated its 20th anniversary from Dec. 2-8. UCSB's Department of Computer Science has hosted the event since 2003 and it is one of the world's largest educational security competitions.† The competition's 20th year is being celebrated slightly differently. For the first time, the 2023 iCTF competition has opened a separate competition for high school students in addition to the thousands of university students participating. This expansion of the competition was furthered by UCSB's brand new AI Institute for Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation (A.C.T.I.O.N.) and UCSB's Women in Computer Science chapter.†† The A.C.T.I.O.N. Institute, a research center funded by the National Science Foundation in 2023, involves experts from 11 institutions who work to change how mission-critical systems are protected from security threats. While the A.C.T.I.O.N. Institute helped to create some of the competition's challenges, others were developed by graduate students of Giovanni Vigna""îprofessor of computer science at UCSB, director of the A.C.T.I.O.N. Institute and founder of iCTF""îas well as students from other universities involved with the A.C.T.I.O.N. Institute. Despite being commonly labeled as a ""hackathon,""ù Vigna encouraged calling the event a ""security competition.""ù The competition's goal is to compromise the security of the competition's challenges, not just to hack.† †Competition participants are set on capturing the virtual flag. Traditionally, there are three types of capture the flag competitions: jeopardy, attack-defense and mixed. In the competition's past, the goal was for teams to attack each other, but this year, the competition was jeopardy style or challenge-based. In general, challenges involve artificially vulnerable programs where the teams must find, patch or abuse the vulnerabilities.† For a week, teams of no more than 10 people worked together to solve challenge sets. By solving a challenge, a flag is acquired. Each flag earns the team points, and the team with the most points at the end wins. The competition's format allowed for teams of hackers to gather on campus or come together remotely.† The first type of challenge was the data challenges. Vigna explained that given a file, hackers ""could perform a forensic-like operation""ù on it. He adds that they also might ""have [had] to connect to a server and break into it, compromise the security, steal the flag, submit it and get points for it.""ù You'll know you've acquired a flag when you see this: †††††††† ictf{all_work_no_play_makes_AI_a_dull_bot} †In 2005, Vigna formed a team of hackers known as Shellphish. Shellphish's ""mission is to explore the science behind hacking, looking for novel approaches to break and fix real-world systems.""ù They have participated in more DefCon capture the flag competitions ""î the largest open computer security hacking game ""î than any other team in the world. Vigna fondly remembered working with his team in the past. ""The fun thing is when you participate, you always learn a lot. You're all in a group and you order pizza. It's a good team building exercise.""ù †Learning by doing is much more interesting than just reading papers, as described by experiences with the Shellphish team. This aligns with the A.C.T.I.O.N. Institute's goals; they want to teach younger kids about artificial intelligence and security. ""What is better than the gamification of learning for high school students?""ù Vigna said. ""No one wants to read a paper, but if you say, ""òHey, participate in this competition and there is a scoreboard,' that's a lot more interesting.""ù †Thinking about the future of iCTF, Vigna reflected on his own competition experience and field expertise. ""Vulnerabilities that were ""òcool' in 2003 are now considered things you would teach in kindergarten, metaphorically speaking,""ù Vigna joked. ""Things have gotten incredibly more complicated.""ù To grow the competition in the future, Vigna wants to create a multilevel competition, like an escape room, where you need one challenge to solve the next. †Vigna encourages those interested in the topic to to try a game to test your hacking skills: Gandalf AI.†† †

science,Simply Stated: What is an El Ni√±o year?,18-Jan-24,9:00 AM,['Saanvi Tiwary'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-18/simply-stated-what-is-an-el-nino-year/,"NATHAN VILLASENOR / DAILY NEXUS If you are like me, you may have heard the explanation, ""because it's an El Ni√±o year""ù as a response to any questions about why it has been raining so much or why it has been so warm all of a sudden. Santa Barbara's climate conditions are subject to seasonal variations, and the El Ni√±o phenomenon has been a significant factor.† According to the National Ocean Service, El Ni√±o is a climate phenomenon characterized by the periodic warming of sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. This warming influences atmospheric conditions, leading to altered weather patterns globally. The El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern, of which El Ni√±o is a part, occurs irregularly every two to seven years and can last for several months. El Ni√±o's impact on precipitation, temperature and other meteorological factors makes it a crucial factor in understanding and predicting regional climate variations. The occurrence of a moderate El Ni√±o event in 2023 brought about discernible changes in Santa Barbara's weather patterns. The data reveals key observations in various meteorological aspects: An increase in precipitation was a notable consequence during the El Ni√±o event in 2023, with the average annual rainfall in downtown Santa Barbara during El Ni√±o years being 21.30 inches, as opposed to 18.07 inches during a typical year. This deviation from the typical dry conditions contributed positively to water resources and alleviated concerns related to drought. However, the surplus rainfall also introduced challenges, particularly in the form of an elevated risk of flooding and landslides.† El Ni√±o's influence on temperature manifested as a moderation in the climate. Warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific contributed to milder temperatures in Santa Barbara. While the increased rainfall proved beneficial for crops by enhancing soil moisture, the potential for flooding posed risks, causing farmers to have to carefully navigate these changes.† Historically, El Ni√±o events often extend across multiple months, which means that we will still be seeing these irregular weather conditions well into this year. Implementing sustainable and adaptive measures is crucial to address the impacts of El Ni√±o events and broader climate change. Local organizations, like the Community Environment Council, publish action alerts about ways the community can work together to prevent climate change in Santa Barbara and California. Investing in renewable energy sources, enhancing water management systems and promoting afforestation efforts can contribute to mitigating the effects of extreme weather events. Additionally, fostering international collaboration and agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is essential for a collective and comprehensive approach to combating the complex challenges posed by El Ni√±o and climate change.

science,Data sheds light on what COVID-19 is like for inmates at CDCR institutions,18-Jan-24,9:00 AM,"['Nicole Xu', 'Collin Tran', 'Sophia Zhu']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-18/data-sheds-light-on-what-covid-19-is-like-for-inmates-at-cdcr-institutions/,"After almost four years, COVID-19 has become the newest normal in daily life. While many have adjusted to this change accordingly, data shows that thousands currently incarcerated at the 33 adult institutions managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and its effects. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is the law enforcement agency in charge of operating California's prisons and parole systems. As of 2023, the department is responsible for 33 adult correctional institutions, 13 adult community correctional facilities and 8 juvenile facilities, making it the largest state-run prison system in the United States. The total population has been consistently above the design capacity. NICOLE XU / DAILY NEXUS When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in the United States in March of 2020, the CDCR held about 120,000 inmates and employed about 50,000 staff. Due to an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the institutions prioritized the release of nonviolent offenders with less than 60 days in their sentence. The number of people admitted to prisons decreased as well, resulting in the lowest state imprisonment level in 30 years. The population dropped from about 120,000 inmates to around 96,000 inmates.† Yet, CDCR institutions today remain overcrowded and at higher risk for infection. Once COVID-19 protections were removed in 2021, most admissions returned to pre-pandemic levels, making overcrowding a pressing issue once again.† The combined design capacity of all 34 CDCR institutions is 85,330 inmates, but from January to October of 2023, the institutions have had an average capacity rate of 109.5%. The design capacity represents the maximum number of inmates that can be housed with safety, comfort and hygiene in mind, meaning that some concessions had to be made in these areas when the population rose above 100%.† Within the cells, there are limited opportunities for the social distancing required to minimize transmission of COVID-19. The standard cell size is anywhere from 25-35 feet, however, in most, if not all cells, there is more than one inmate. This leaves little room for each inmate to be at least 6 feet from the others in their cell, not including the other amenities such as furniture. With overcrowding and consequent lack of distancing, inmates are much more susceptible to any disease and infection. Coupled with the preexisting conditions that many inmates have, as well as the older demographic of the institutions, inmates are at higher risk than the average Californian to contract COVID-19.† According to California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS), more than 10,000 inmates were treated for hepatitis C in 2018. Approximately 8,000 of California's inmates are diabetic, 12% of male and 20% of female inmates were asthmatic in 2010 and in 2015, 0.8% of California's inmates were HIV positive. These rates are almost double that of the general Californian population. These chronic illnesses especially raise the risk of COVID-19 infection because they target or weaken the respiratory and immune systems.† In order to combat this issue, the CDCR has set a number of guidelines: each facility's housing units are either categorized into outbreak or open phase. In the open phase, the facility is allowed to function as normal while still observing COVID-19 precautions. The goal is to move from the outbreak to the open phase, or to maintain the open phase.† According to the CDCR guidelines, in order to move to the open phase, the unit must have no new incarcerated persons outbreak cases in 14 days. If a housing unit experiences an outbreak, they then revert back to the outbreak phase. Under these guidelines, an outbreak is defined as three or more epidemiologically-linked cases of COVID-19 among incarcerated persons in a period of 14 days. Currently, in the overall CDCR population, there are 14 housing units that are in the outbreak phase and 840 that are in the open phase. Note the logarithmic scale of the # of inmates tested. NICOLE XU / DAILY NEXUS At the height of the pandemic, the CDCR and CCHCS had stricter guidelines in place. However, with the continuous drop in COVID-19 cases in all institutions in recent years and the high vaccination rates among the population throughout the state's prisons, the reopening guidelines have been updated and loosened, according to the CDCR's COVID-19 timeline. Routine surveillance and exposure testing have become voluntary, but all of the institutions continue to test inmates daily, with some prisons testing their entire population in one day.† Despite significant progress having been made in reducing inmate populations as well as implementing health guidelines, institutionalized individuals remain at higher risk for infectious diseases compared to the rest of the population. Unfortunately, the inherent nature of correctional facilities has proven it difficult to mitigate these issues completely. Problems like this have existed prior to COVID-19, and will likely persist for years to come. Nevertheless, moving forward, the CDCR's experience with the COVID-19 pandemic may serve as a valuable lesson in using policy to address public health emergencies at correctional institutions around the world.

science,Simply Stated: What caused the massive waves on the California coast?,25-Jan-24,9:00 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-25/simply-stated-what-caused-the-massive-waves-on-the-california-coast/,"† Recent swells dare Santa Barbara surfers to test the waters. LAURYN CUMMINS / DAILY NEXUS If you were anywhere on the California coast last month, you were likely one of millions receiving high surf warnings and coastal flooding advisories. On Dec. 28, 2023, Santa Barbara experienced 20-foot waves that had weakened from 40-footers after a few hundred miles of traveling to the shore. Despite the warnings, many surfers took to spots like Rincon Beach Park and caught double overhead waves, meaning the waves scaled about 12 feet.† In Ventura, an unexpected rogue wave sent eight onlookers near the shore to the hospital and caused significant damage and flooding in the streets. The wave that rushed in without warning is known as a ""sneaker wave.""ù And, according to Tim DeVries, a professor in the Department of Geography at UC Santa Barbara, sneaker waves are typically at least twice as big as average waves and can come unexpectedly if one is not watching the water. ""On any given day, waves come into the coast in many different sizes,""ù DeVries said. ""During a large swell, the average size of the waves might be 10 feet, but occasionally there may be 15-foot, 18-foot or even 20-foot waves.""ù DeVries warned potential beachgoers to be on guard.† ""One should always expect them to come at some point,""ù he said. ""The best way to identify sneaker waves is to look at the ocean and watch the waves ""î do not turn your back on the ocean!""ù† Ventura County spent $2 million in the aftermath to repair the Ventura Pier and coastline damage. Many other coastal communities such as those in San Luis Obispo County and Santa Cruz closed their beaches and piers in light of the high surf.†† So, what is causing these huge wave events? Dave Gomberg, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, explains that the waves were generated by two cyclones in the Pacific spanning from Alaska to the Central Coast. Despite being hundreds of miles away, these powerful storms produced 40-foot waves that dropped to 20-footers as they reached the coast. In addition to the storms, a King Tide was expected to hit the shore on Jan. 11, increasing concerns for more coastal flooding. A King Tide is an exceptionally high tide, usually the highest of the year, followed by an extremely low tide. According to DeVries, large tidal swings of especially high and then especially low tides are linked to the full moon and the new moon, occurring twice a month. During these events, the Earth, Moon and Sun have aligned gravitational forces. ""When this situation coincides with the Earth, Moon and Sun being closer together than usual, then you get King Tides,""ù DeVries said. ""Now, when you get a very high tide combined with very large waves, then you can get a lot of coastal flooding, which would be an unfortunate coincidence.""ù† Although the cyclones in the Pacific have receded, more storms may form during the El Ni√±o season which is expected to continue until April 2024.

science,Finding Focus: UCSB researchers develop customizable app to strengthen attention skills and minimize mind wandering,25-Jan-24,9:00 AM,['Olivia Gil de Bernabe'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-25/finding-focus-ucsb-researchers-develop-customizable-app-to-strengthen-attention-skills-and-minimize-mind-wandering/,"ZOE GONZALES / DAILY NEXUS. In an age where our attention is considered a new currency, a constant barrage of distractions make focusing on what's important to us an endless challenge. Finding Focus, a new mobile app developed by a collaborative team of researchers from UC Santa Barbara and The University of Texas at Austin, operates on the premise that, just like any other skill, attention can be trained. Through its unique personalizable features, it guides users through mindfulness exercises that train their attention and reduce mind wandering.† Jonathan Schooler, a professor in the UC Santa Barbara Psychological and Brain Sciences Department and principal investigator of the META (Memory, Emotion, Thought, Awareness) Lab, spoke on the iterative nature of the app's development and the studies backing its efficacy.† ""The Department of Education granted us funds to develop this app for high school students to address the epidemic of mind wandering and distraction,""ù Schooler said.† Having implemented it in over 100 high schools across the United States, the researchers have conducted a number of studies investigating the impact of Finding Focus on well-being and, in particular, mind wandering.† Mind wandering is the experience of thinking about something other than what you're trying to attend to or work on. For instance, if you're writing an essay and find yourself disrupted with the thought to check on new messages ""î that's mind-wandering.† ""In the past, we found that Finding Focus reduced people's mind-wandering on the self-report scale,""ù Schooler said. ""Study participants responded to general retrospective questions, such as, ""òHow much are you mind wandering these days?'""ù Dharma Lewis, a recent UCSB graduate and the current lab manager of META Lab, conducted her undergraduate honors thesis using an experience-sampling method that is more precise than retrospective self-reporting to investigate how Finding Focus affects mind wandering.† ""I had participants complete a sustained attention task, and I asked them a couple of different times throughout the task, ""òjust right now, were you on-task or off-task?'""ù Lewis said. ""The proportion of answers that they replied ""òyes' to was the proportion of mind-wandering.""ù†† Random self-report pings provided a more accurate measure of mind-wandering. Lewis' study found that participants who utilized Finding Focus as an intervention experienced a notable decrease in mind-wandering.† In contrast, participants in the control group, who utilized the popular mindfulness app Lumosity as an intervention, showed no decline. The study also made use of a proxy behavioral measure of mind-wandering, which didn't detect a change in mind wandering. Schooler acknowledged its imperfections, stating that it may have ""confounded mind-wandering with inhibitory ability.""ù† Facing the challenge of designing an app that appeals to high school students, Finding Focus has evolved through many iterations based on student feedback.† ""We're trying to engage high school students who might very well be resistant to the standard focus on your breath type of meditation instructions,""ù Schooler said.† To make the app more accessible, the app developers incorporated unique features. Its 10-day ""bootcamp""ù style course offers brief and engaging tutorials that succinctly establish the value of mindfulness.† Schooler emphasized the need for students to comprehend why training attention is essential.† ""We want them to understand, ""òwhy bother doing this in the first place?'""ù he said. ""Attention is key to so many different things ""¶ If you can direct your attention, you can acquire the information that you need and ignore the information that you don't.""ù A potent anchoring metaphor illustrates how we may train attention. Users are prompted to imagine how when ships that are anchored drift away, their anchor catches them, pulling them back. Attention can be anchored in the same way.† Additionally, rather than having users focus on the standard mindfulness activity of breathing, the app offers various musical genres ""î hip hop, indie/folk, chill electronica and relaxing ""î for users to anchor their attention to. The musical pieces were custom-made for the app, and each song is preceded by an introduction by the artist talking about how mindfulness is valuable to their everyday lives.† The latest feature, Focus Sesh, allows users to set it up during tasks, like homework,† periodically pinging them and asking if they were wandering or paying attention. If the user is paying attention, it adjusts and waits longer to ping them again.† This feature aims at encouraging meta awareness, one of the main research focuses of the META lab. Meta awareness is one's explicit contents of consciousness at any particular time. """"ãPeople are mind wandering without realizing [it],""ù Schooler said. ""They can be thinking about something completely unrelated to what they're reading; [They'll] be flipping the pages, and have this moment of ""òoh my gosh ""î I haven't been paying attention to what I've been reading.'""ù† The iterative journey of Finding Focus is far from over. The researchers plan to further explore the potential of Focus Sesh in research trials going forward. In addition, the researchers are excited about the possibility of implementing the application beyond high school and into college-level curricula.† You can download Finding Focus for free in iOS and Android.

science,Simply Stated: How sustainable is the Stanley Cup?,1-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Olivia Lohrer'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-01/simply-stated-how-sustainable-is-the-stanley-cup/,"SIMONE MANSELL / DAILY NEXUS A series of †TikTok videos went viral in December, showing Target shoppers aggressively running towards and grabbing Stanley's newly-released, limited edition ""Cosmo Pink""ù and ""Target Red""ù 40 ounce ""Quenchers.""ù These tumblers have become the newest, in-vogue version of the ongoing transition to reusable drinkware. Marketed as a sustainable way to stay hydrated, the Stanley's hype has begun to contradict the environmentally-minded premise of purchasing a reusable water bottle: limiting unnecessary consumption. Although Stanley has been creating drinkware for over 100 years, the company can credit TikTok with its recent rise to fame. In the past few months, these tumblers have become a collector's item and, according to Business Insider, Stanley's annual sales rose from $94 million in 2020 to $750 million in 2023. Furthermore, the Quencher was the single most popular gift teens received for Christmas in 2023. Now, people no longer need just one reusable cup. Many of the viral videos, typically made popular through the algorithmic power of ""ò#watertok,' showcase people showing off their extensive Stanley Cup collection, often consisting of dozens of tumblers. The cups can be purchased online for $45, however, many of the most sought-after models ""î such as those part of their collaboration with Starbucks ""î are being resold for prices nearing $300. The desirability of these tumblers has raised other questions in the name of sustainability, namely: who needs that many water bottles if you can only drink from one at a time? In response to the recent craze, TikTok commenters and environmentalists have begun to question whether this is more of the same for our throw-away society.† ""At Stanley, we believe that through invention and originality we create a more sustainable, less disposable life and world,""ù Stanley's online statement on sustainability reads. Additionally, it highlights the company's four principles of sustainability. They offer a ""built for life""ù warranty, they are committed to making at least 50% of their stainless steel products from ""recycled materials""ù by 2025, they are committed to ""sustainable packaging""ù by 2025 and they utilize ""values-led manufacturing.""ù† Still, trend analysts hypothesize that, like every other fad that has come and gone, we are in the height of the Stanley Cup's popularity and they will inevitably be cast aside for another reusable water container. And when they do, the options for recycling them are limited.† The vast majority of disposed Stanleys are predicted to end up in landfills. According to a New York Times article on green drinkware, ""producing that 300-gram stainless steel bottle requires seven times as much fossil fuel, releases 14 times more greenhouse gases, demands the extraction of hundreds of times more metal resources and causes hundreds of times more toxic risk to people and ecosystems than making a 32-gram plastic bottle.""ù† Between the resources required in production, the carbon footprint associated with distribution, their relatively short life span as a microtrend, and their final disposal, most Stanley cups will not be kept on shelves long enough to see their existence reach the breakeven point when they become more environmentally viable than plastic water bottles. From an environmental point of view ""î and arguably from a financial one as well ""î buying another Stanley that will sit in your cupboard as a ""òcollector's item' is just not worth it.† Still, owning one reusable water bottle ""î whether it is a Stanley, a Hydro Flask or a YETI ""î and using it for an extended period (multiple years) has never been the issue; in fact, it is a big part of the solution to our growing plastic crisis. The issue arises when society turns everyday items initially intended to be a more sustainable option into the newest coveted craze in the greater culture of mass consumption.† The most sustainable thing that you can do is to learn to be content with less. One Stanley cup should suffice your hydration needs! A version of this article appeared on pg. 10 of the Feb. 1, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.†

science,"Research in Review: Groundwater depletion, metabolic imaging, and shark fishing",1-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-01/research-in-review-groundwater-depletion-metabolic-imaging-and-shark-fishing/,"Global groundwater decline UC Santa Barbara Assistant Professors Scott Jasechko and Debra Perrone recently published a paper analyzing data from 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems across over 40 countries, showing that globally, there is extensive and rapid groundwater level decline, particularly in dry regions with large-scale croplands.† The researchers compiled groundwater level data by delineating aquifer systems across the globe and performing a literature review of local published studies. Statistical analyses of groundwater level trends included Theil-Sen regression slopes, which estimate the slope of linear relationships between two variables. This type of regression was ideal because it is not sensitive to outliers and allowed the team to compare trends between the late 20th and early 21st centuries from a large data set. They found that, compared to 1980 to 2000, about 30% of aquifer systems had experienced accelerated groundwater-level declines between 2000 and 2022. Despite many previous publications discussing groundwater scarcity and unsustainable groundwater withdrawals, few touch on the potential for aquifer recovery. The study highlighted the recovery of depleted aquifers, finding that in about half of the analyzed aquifer systems, groundwater-level declines have slowed and show potential for aquifer recovery. This research suggests that aquifer depletion is not necessarily inevitable and can be reversed, despite the fact that rapidly rising groundwater levels are rare. The study also acknowledged its various limitations such as data availability; analysis can only be done on areas from which existing data is available. In addition, results are based on annual averages, while groundwater levels can vary between seasons. Climate variability is another factor that can influence recent groundwater levels compared to the late twentieth century. Another question the researchers are currently investigating is how climate change affects groundwater levels and subsequently how to predict groundwater levels in certain areas.† Metabolic Imaging When studying metabolism-related diseases, it is critical to use metabolic imaging to understand and study""ùmetabolic heterogeneity,""ù or the differences between metabolic activities among cells. Metabolic heterogeneity can affect many aspects of human health and plays a role in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and cancer. Although much progress has been made to study these processes, current imaging methods have limitations and are often used to study model organisms that lack practical significance to humans. To address this, UCSB researchers at the Kosik Lab developed an imaging platform that involves the mapping of lipid metabolism in human-derived cultures at the single-cell level. Optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) microscopy, as it is called, features high resolution and is compatible with fluorescence imaging. In the study, researchers utilized an azide-tagged infrared probe to detect newly synthesized lipids. Experiments involving human-relevant model systems such as human-induced pluripotent stem cells and human brain organoids ""î artificially grown organ tissue ""î were performed. Lipid metabolism was observed in various cell types and mutations, over time and with differentiation stages. Findings suggested that neurons in brain organoids had a considerable reduction in lipid metabolism function in comparison to astrocytes, a type of non-neural central nervous system cell. The researchers compared the O-PTIR method with other single-cell metabolic imaging methods such as optical metabolic imaging (OMI). Compared to O-PTIR, OMI is more challenging to adapt to other metabolic pathways such as that of cholesterol. In further research, the team intends to improve the O-PTIR platform system, including by performing experiments with a greater number of cells to detect more subtle heterogeneity. Shark Fishing Mortality Overfishing has long posed a threat to many aquatic species, including sharks, whose populations have steadily declined due over the past decade. Researchers at UCSB recently co-published a paper discussing mortality rates of sharks across the globe even after widespread protective legislation has been put in place. This legislation intended to reduce shark bycatch from pelagic tuna fisheries and prevent shark finning, a lucrative practice in which sharks' fins are removed before the animals are released back into the ocean. The study of spatial and temporal trends in shark fishing mortality and its link to legislative regulation had not been done before. The researchers found that between 2012 and 2019, total shark fishing mortality increased from at least 76 to 80 million sharks. In addition, the mortality of sharks in coastal waters increased by 4% whereas mortality decreased by 7% in pelagic fisheries. In this study the researchers took a synthetic approach by compiling available data published or reported by fisheries, countries and regional fishery management organizations (RFMOs). Specifically, they studied global patterns of shark fishing mortality and compared them to regulations put in place at that time. Areas of high shark fishing mortality were shown to be in coastal environments including the Atlantic coast, West Africa, the North Indian Ocean and the Coral Triangle. A decrease in mortality in pelagic fisheries was related to the introduction of RFMO regulations which banned the retention, or harvesting, of certain threatened species. Although finning regulations have been adopted, they have not been shown to reduce shark mortality. The findings suggest that instead of finning, shark fishing has become more concentrated on small coastal species that are not protected by regulations. However, some regional shark fishing and retention bans, such as the RFMO regulations, have shown success. Nevertheless, the researchers provide evidence that shark fishing regulations need to be expanded and that conservation efforts should be pursued to protect these threatened species.

science,Simply Stated: What is the astronomy of Lunar New Year?,8-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Isabelle Kang'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-08/simply-stated-what-is-the-astronomy-of-lunar-new-year/,"SIMONE MANSELL / DAILY NEXUS For those whose ""new year, new me""ù plans for 2024 seem to be veering off course, look no further than Lunar New Year ""î a time to reset, recuperate, eat yummy food and bond with family. Long-standing Chinese traditions include gifting red envelopes, lighting lanterns and watching artistic lion dances. This 15-day festival originated in China over 3,000 years ago, and has since then spread to countries with large Chinese populations such as Vietnam, Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia to manifest luck and prosperity during the first new moon of the new year. Unlike the Gregorian new year, which unmistakably lands on Jan. 1, the Lunar new year falls anywhere between Jan. 20 and Feb. 21. In 2023, the holiday fell on Jan. 22, and in the year prior, on Feb. 1. This year, the Year of the Dragon, begins relatively late on Feb. 10, 2024. This fluctuation stems from the mismatch of the lunisolar calendar ""î a system that uses both sun and moon patterns to quantify the year ""î and the current Gregorian calendar. Each lunisolar month begins with a new moon, and each year begins with the new moon closest to the halfway mark between the winter solstice and spring equinox, thus marking the end of winter and the beginning of spring.† Take this year, for example; the winter solstice took place on Dec. 21, 2023, and the subsequent new moons occurred on Jan. 11 and Feb. 9, 2024 (or Feb. 10 CST). Feb. 10, being closer to the midpoint between Dec. 21 and March 19 (spring equinox), is determined to be the beginning of Lunar New Year celebrations.† The famed 12 zodiac animals ""î rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig ""î are used to pair with each lunar year. Unlike the Western astrological signs, which are derived from astronomy, the 12 zodiac animals held cultural significance and were frequent characters in East Asian mythology. Those born in different zodiac years are thought to harbor different traits, which may provide insight on personalities, careers and romantic compatibility. For instance, those born in the Year of the Dragon are believed to be especially confident, intelligent and enthusiastic. They pair well with monkey, rooster and rat zodiacs, but may conflict with ox, dog or goat zodiacs.† Despite adopting the Gregorian calendar in 1912, China and other Southeast and East Asian countries continue to use the lunisolar calendar to forecast other holiday dates such as the Mid-Autumn, Qingming and Duanwu festivals.† During this two-week celebratory period, festivities vary from day to day, with specific traditions in different countries on each of the 15 days leading up to the full moon. The first day of Chinese New Year holds mythological significance, as it is believed this is when Nian, an ancient monster, comes out to terrorize civilians. Lighting loud firecrackers, performing lion dances and wearing red clothes are believed to scare Nian into hibernation.† A well known superstition in Chinese and Vietnamese families is that cleaning on the first day could also ""throw away""ù good luck for the new year, so household tidying is forbidden and can only be done in the days leading up to the new moon.† On the second day, married daughters visit their parents with their husband and children, and on subsequent days, people make offerings to various gods, visit temples and dine with relatives. Special new year dishes often had symbolic meanings; for instance, Chinese families would traditionally serve steamed fish since the word ""fish""ù (yu) sounds like the word ""plentiful""ù in Mandarin, suggesting plentiful wealth and resources. Additionally, dumplings (mandu) and rice cake soup (tteokguk) are eaten by Korean families as a way to mark the start of a new year.† Whether or not Lunar New Year is observed in your household, this coming weekend is a great opportunity for all to practice the essential purpose of the holiday: to eat good food with family and friends, heal mentally and physically and manifest good luck for the year ahead.† A version of this article appeared on pg. 11 of the Feb. 8, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.†

science,Catching a wave of innovation: Central Coast company Patagonia reinvents the wetsuit,8-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Madasyn Mueller'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-08/catching-a-wave-of-innovation-central-coast-company-patagonia-reinvents-the-wetsuit/,"Professional surfer and Santa Barbara native, Kilian Garland field testing a Patagonia wetsuit. COURTESY OF JEFF FENNELL UC Santa Barbara† students can swap their lab coat for a wetsuit, trading biology lab at the university's Marine Biotechnology Lab for catching waves at Campus Point in under five minutes. Surfing has a rich history on the Central Coast, and was even enacted as California's official state sport in Assembly Bill 1782. The rise in surfing's popularity in California coincided with UCSB's establishment in 1954. Today, a course titled ""Geography of Surfing,""ù is offered annually at UCSB.† Because of the proximity to such notable waves, many global recreational brands, including Patagonia, call the Central Coast home ""î and employ a number of UCSB alumni. Tantamount to UCSB's students, Patagonia's surf division, based in Ventura, can trade their work for a surf session in a matter of minutes. The difference is, their research continues out in the water.† In the growing $4 billion global surf industry, Patagonia constitutes a small market share but has a considerable impact. Within the past 10 years, Patagonia's surf division has reinvented the wetsuit through a design that reflects the imminent concerns of climate change. The fibers of their wetsuits, interwoven with sustainable natural rubber, recycled wetsuits† and soon to be lined with recycled fishing net polymers, represent what is possible when a company and its employees prioritize collective good over individual profit in their garment. A visit to Patagonia's surf division at the Forge in Ventura provided insight into how the wetsuits ""î and the people behind them, including Product Line Manager Hub Hubbard ""î are making innovative strides in the surf industry. At the Forge, a corner block warehouse, the wetsuits team's circular philosophy of test, redesign, repair and modify comes to life.† In 2014, the company's wetsuit department led industry-wide shifts, away from neoprene, toward adopting the renewably sourced natural tree rubber, Yulex, which resulted in an 80% overall decrease in CO2 emissions. Even more, rather than keeping the success of Yulex exclusive to their company, Patagonia shared it with other surf companies to initiate a concerted industry departure from neoprene.† Neoprene, a petroleum-based synthetic rubber, has been used as the primary component of wetsuit construction since the advent of the wetsuit at UC Berkeley in the 1950s. Today, 65% of all wetsuits globally, roughly 6 million pieces annually, are manufactured solely by Asia-based sportswear manufacturer Sheico. However, the USA remains the largest producer of neoprene worldwide.† The production of neoprene is an environmentally hazardous and energy intensive process. As a crude oil based polymer, it is non-renewable, ecologically damaging and amasses in landfills requiring hundreds of years to degrade.† In addition, the production of neoprene is a public health crisis. Recently, filmmakers Lewis Arnold and Chris Nelson exposed the harrowing connection between surfing and Louisiana's Cancer Alley: a corridor with cancerous air-quality along Louisiana's Mississippi River caused by the unrelenting emissions of industrial plants. Labeled as environmental racism by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Cancer Alley disproportionately affects Black and poor communities.† Among the industrial plants of Cancer Alley is Denka, the sole US producer of chloroprene which is the chemical name for neoprene. In 2010 chloroprene was deemed as a likely carcinogen by the EPA. Residents of Cancer Alley who live within one mile of the Denka plant, 94% of whom are Black, have a cancer rate 50 times the national average, confirmed by the EPA to be a result of chloroprene emissions. Patagonia's early leading shift from neoprene to Yulex natural rubber served to be both an environmental and ethical decision.† Many surfers, such as 2017 World Surf League North American Champion and Patagonia field tester, Kilian Garland, are championing the innovations of Patagonia's wetsuit team.† ""The Patagonia suits are getting to a place where they are more eco-friendly and better [than those made of neoprene],""ù† Garland said. ""So, if you can make just little choices that are beneficial for the planet and for everybody around you, then it's kind of a no brainer.""ù At Patagonia's wetsuit forge, employees are now pioneering another change: redefining the lifecycle of their wetsuit for longevity and circularity.† On any given day at the Forge, the wetsuit team will sew a current design iteration of their regulator wetsuit, travel mere blocks down to the ocean and paddle out to test the suit. For Hubbard, it is his favorite aspect of the job. †""Building a suit out of [the wetsuit forge] and running down to Emma Wood and jumping in the water,""ù Hubbard said, ""that's by far the best part ""¶ Nobody [else] has the ability to do this, [to] actually build wetsuits on site, go test them and then see: [do we] bring the neck in? Change this seam? We can do that.""ù Alongside the information gained through rigorous field testing of their wetsuits' material construction and design, the wetsuit team gains equally valuable insight from busted wetsuits sent into their lifelong repair program. The team's overall goal, in line with Patagonia's larger ethos to avoid unnecessary environmental harm, is to design a garment for both performance and longevity. Patagonia's current wetsuit iteration is designed to last up to four seasons of regular surfing compared to the typical one season of other wetsuit companies. Although Patagonia's wetsuit is engineered for longevity, seams inevitably fail and zippers bust due the harsh conditions wetsuits are subjected to. In this case, rather than opting to buy a new wetsuit, Patagonia's wetsuit team encourages the public to send their damaged Patagonia wetsuit in for repair, often free of charge. At the Forge, the wetsuit repair team ""î the unsung heroes at the helm of single needle lockstitch sewing machines ""î effectively repair 90% of all wetsuits sent in to be mended. Even with repairs, wetsuits, like everything else, will eventually reach the end of their life. However, due to a recent recycling innovation launched in early January by Patagonia, end-of-life wetsuits don't need to wind up in the landfill, they can be used to make new ones. Wetsuits and most other black rubber products, like tires, require the colorant and reinforcing filler carbon black which is typically made from the incomplete combustion of coal tar and petroleum products. In the last decade, Boulder, Colorado based company Bolder Industries created one of the world's first reclaimed carbon blacks, BolderBlack. Made of 100% post-consumer tires and rubber scrap, BolderBlack emits 90% less greenhouse gasses than traditional carbon black.† Patagonia's wetsuit team wondered if wetsuits could be included in reclaimed carbon black? In a collaborative process that took nearly six years between Bolder Industries and Patagonia, the two companies successfully incorporated old wetsuits into reclaimed carbon black.† UCSB surf team member and Student Liam Ereneta, sporting one of the backpacks Patagonia plans to soon dye with recycled wetsuits, off to surf near Campus Point. MADASYN MUELLER / DAILY NEXUS ""You can use old wetsuits to make new wetsuits,""ù Hubbard commented on the circulatory triumph. ""We'll keep [the wetsuit] going for as long as we can and then when it's done we are going to ship it to Boulder and turn it into carbon black and then it will be shipped to Taiwan and it's going to be used to make the new foam ""¶ So we have a full circular story.""ù† The wetsuit teams are relentless innovators. In the near future, Hubbard's goal is for every Patagonia product that is dyed black to use reclaimed carbon black. The company has already had success on the small scale, rolling out small black six-liter bags dyed with old wetsuits. Soon, their black backpacks, that popularly dot many of UCSB's classrooms and climbing gym floors, could interweave the stories of waves surfed by local students and the metaphorical ""DNA""ù from many other surfing predecessors.†

science,Simply Stated: Are aphrodisiacs a hoax?,15-Feb-24,9:00 AM,"['Olivia Gil de Bernabe', 'Katharine Chi']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-15/simply-stated-are-aphrodisiacs-a-hoax/,"What is an aphrodisiac? An aphrodisiac is a substance or food that can provoke arousal, sexual desire, behavior and even pleasure. There are three typical usage types for aphrodisiac foods: increasing libido (sexual desire), increasing sexual potency and performance and improving sexual pleasure. Ultimately, aphrodisiac foods are typically consumed with the intention of finding more pleasure in sexual activities, but there is a lack of concrete evidence and research that truly proves the validity of these claims. With regard to the psychological effects of aphrodisiacs, one must recognize the placebo effect ""î believing that the effect of a substance is more beneficial than the substance itself ""î and understand that an individual's expectation could manifest itself into successful results. Although there isn't research to back the marketing claims of aphrodisiac foods, it does not discredit the fact that certain foods can stimulate an individual's sex life. Some have specific properties, such as omega 3 fatty acids, that increase blood flow and can bring upon the label of ""òaphrodisiac' as they have the ability to benefit sexual activities.† Chocolate:
 An iconic Valentine's Day staple, chocolate, has a mythical status in popular media and literature for being a food that can increase sexual desireand pleasure. Science suggests biochemical reasons for chocolate's aphrodisiac label. Not only does it contain phenylethylamine, a chemical released during the early stages of attraction, but eating it also appears to release serotonin and dopamine, two mood-elevating chemicals. However, modern research suggests that chocolate's reported effects on human sexuality have more to do with marketing-induced placebo than with physiological outcomes. One study conducted in Italy to assess the association between chocolate intake and sexual function in women found no statistically significant correlation between chocolate consumption and sexual distress and sexual desire. Women that reported eating more than one chocolate cube daily reported higher sexual function, but the researchers hypothesized that other lifestyle habits accounted for this difference. To this day, no studies have found a physiological effect of chocolate intake on human sexuality.† Chili peppers: Spicy and hot, the concentration of capsaicin is what makes chili peppers a spice delicacy. Chili peppers are considered to be aphrodisiacs that arouse desire due to their ability to increase body temperatures. A study focused on capsaicin and energy expenditure revealed that the thermogenic ingredient can promote fat oxidation and increase energy expenditure without significantly increasing blood pressure. Chili peppers have been claimed to also increase body sensations. In addition to increasing the body temperature, hot chili peppers are known to increase the libido and testosterone levels, but there isn't substantial evidence to back this claim.† Red wine: A classic romantic dinner companion, red wine is another famed aphrodisiac. No studies have found causational evidence to support this labeling, but several have suggested a correlational relationship between red wine consumption and better sexuality. In one study sampling women, it was found that women who regularly drank a moderate amount of red wine had higher self-reported sexual desire and overall sexual function as compared to those who never drank red wine. In another study examining the effects of red wine on sexual function in men, scientists found that the antioxidant properties of compounds in wine may be beneficial to the reproductive system. However, they concluded that there is insufficient evidence to state that red wine consumption improves sexual function due to the lack of research on the precise role of polyphenols and the mechanisms of their action. Asparagus: Unexpectedly, asparagus is an aphrodisiac that is filled with vitamin E, which is known to increase blood and oxygen flow, as well as potassium, a vitamin that is essential for the production of sex-hormones. The nutrients work to cleanse the kidneys and the urinary tract, while giving a boost of energy. In addition to the vitamins packed in asparagus, the vegetable's aspartic acid alleviates excess ammonia found in the body, thus combatting fatigue and sexual disinterest. In one study, a group of male subjects took asparagus supplements for a two month period and the results showed improvements in erectile dysfunction in comparison to the control group. A great source for balancing hormone levels, asparagus is an aphrodisiac that can encourage a higher sex drive and improve sexual function.† So, is there any definite scientific merit to aphrodisiacs? Not really. Many of them ""î berries, red wine, dark chocolate ""î may improve relaxation through increased blood flow, but there is no smoking-gun evidence linking any one food consumption to increased sexual desire and performance. Additionally, the concept of consuming something to improve a sexual experience may seem innocent enough, but indulging in the aphrodisiac market may actually have serious ramifications. For example, the fact that rhino populations have been driven to abysmally low levels is largely attributed to a myth that their horns have aphrodisiac properties. The pursuit of heightened sexual experiences should not come at the expense of endangered species and ecosystems. Therefore, when looking to enhance intimacy, be conscientious of the approach you take. A holistic look on lifestyle and health choices is a better indicator of sexual health, many experts say. Dr. Michael Krychman, a renowned researcher in the field of sexual medicine emphasized this in one interview discussing aphrodisiacs. """"¶ People who exercise, have a healthy diet and lower stress, all these elements work together and they have better sex lives,""ù he said. So, next time you want to get the mood going, maybe try de-stressing through exercise before you reach for the oysters, asparagus or chocolate.† Art by LAUREN BRYANT.

science,California Against the Sea: Rosanna Xia visits UCSB to discuss her latest book,15-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Madasyn Mueller'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-15/california-against-the-sea-rosanna-xia-visits-ucsb-to-discuss-her-latest-book/,"Los Angeles Times reporter and Pulitzer Prize finalist, Rosanna Xia, visited UC Santa Barbara on Feb. 8 to discuss how sea level rise is threatening California coastal communities from Crescent City down to Imperial Beach. Xia sat down with Director of UCSB's Ocean & Coastal Policy Center (OCPC) Charles Lester to discuss her recent book ""California Against the Sea: Visions for Our Vanishing Coastline.""ù Her talk was part of the larger public ""Imagining California Series,""ù hosted by UCSB's Interdisciplinary Humanities Center (IHC) at the Humanities and Social Sciences Building.† ""California Against the Sea""ù is a detailed anthology of the 1200 mile California coastline and the people who call it home, from the distant past to the not-so-distant future.† Intertwined with insight from several UC Santa Barbara researchers, Xia's book is an interdisciplinary investigation. She dissects how the interplay of science, politics, stewardship and land use have shaped the dynamic California coastline while centering Indigenous narratives, such as those of the local Chumash people. Her prose ""î poised, yet urgent -""ì are a call to action as the Pacific ocean edges ever-closer into the coastline.† Her talk at the IHC was moderated by Lester, whose research was featured in Xia's book. Throughout the talk, Xia and Lester touched on the adverse ways Californians are trying to impose permanence ""î such as seawalls ""î onto the impermanent coast, in an attempt to preserve coastal communities from sea level rise.† Cautiously, Xia advised the audience. ""The ocean is moving in, the coast is supposed to move with it, and we're supposed to move with the coast,""ù she said. ""The longer we try to hold this line, the more it is going to cost us.""ù† Sea level rise and coastal erosion are issues all too familiar to residents of Santa Barbara and Isla Vista. SHIUAN CHENG / DAILY NEXUS As she highlights in ""California Against the Sea,""ù the boundaries between coast and sea are always shifting. ""In the last 100 years, the sea rose less than 9 inches in California; by the end of this century the surge could be greater than 6, possibly 7 feet,""ù Xia wrote. Even for the people who do not live to see this change, the question remains: How do communities transform for the inevitable future?† As California moves toward mitigating the effects of sea level rise, Xia argues that the way people assign value to tangible entities, like land, needs to be critically examined. ""Who benefits from preserving the world the way it is today? Whose property? Whose health?""ù Xia said.† Xia spent a large portion of the talk discussing the processes of resilience and restoration in small coastal communities, topics in her book's section, ""Missing Pieces.""ù† Speaking on resilience, she drew the audience's attention to a small, overlooked Northern California town she visited while writing her book, Marin City.† For decades now, when the tide is high or there is a heavy rain, Marin City becomes a flooded, trapped wetland. It is an issue expected to get worse with sea level rise, but it's not at the forefront of residents' minds.† For years, they have been afflicted with unexplained cancer and high asthma rates. Xia explains that for this community, the attention of sea level rise became an opportunity to address decades-long public and environmental health issues.† ""Restoring green space into a community is a climate change issue [and] a resilience issue""ù Xia said. In addition, she underscored how sea level rise became an opportunity to clean up the toxic contaminated soil that has long plagued Marin City. Xia calls into question how people restore land matters. ""Nowhere in California can things be restored exactly the way things were before,""ù she said. ""How do you bring back the past in a way that will survive the future?""ù† Currently, UCSB and, by extension, Isla Vista ""î a coastal campus and community ""îhave committed to adapt to and plan for sea level rise. For the UCSB campus, the state of California requires it to have a sea level rise adaptation strategy. The responsibility of this strategy plan largely falls onto the OCPC guided by Lester.† ""The University is working on this strategy which imagines a future where we don't try to protect everything with seawalls. And the reason for that is because seawalls are bad for beaches,""ù Lester said in a separate interview with the Nexus. ""The plan expresses this intent to try to avoid that by thinking proactively about, for example, moving back infrastructure or public access along the bluff top, as needed, to adapt to the erosion that is going to continue and likely get worse.""ù† Last week's coastal balcony collapse on the 67 block of Del Playa Drive, due to coastal erosion after the recent heavy rains, is a poignant reminder that no community is immune from sea level rise. However, coastal bluff collapse is not an uncommon occurrence for the community of Isla Vista.† ""The issue of sea level rise and adaptation is a very real one, for I.V. ""¶ It's been experiencing erosion there for a long time, really since we have the Coastal Act, 50 years ago,""ù Lester said. He then went on to discuss Santa Barbara County's own efforts. ""The county does have a program in place to try to systematically retreat development on that blufftop which is in danger and not safe ""¶ it's actually a good example of statewide jurisdiction being proactive [about this problem],""ù he said. ""Which is something Rosanna's book frames for. How can we get ahead of this thing that is happening, sea level rise, in a deliberate, planned way?""ù One does not need to be a coastal property owner or a Del Playa resident, however, to participate in the discourse and mitigation of sea level rise; the ocean belongs to everyone. In California, the right to access the coast is guaranteed to every state resident, as enacted in the Coastal Act of 1976.† ""There is so much shared connection in the ocean,""ù Xia said toward the conclusion of her talk. She advises that, as California grapples with sea level rise, inhabitants' collective admiration of and appreciation for its iconic coastlines remains a uniting force in efforts toward adaptation.† Expanding upon this, Xia also noted how non-native California residents are guests on the land. This notion, a point also mentioned in her book, comes from the Tongva Nation concept of kuuyam, which means ""guest""ù in Tongva. Xia was first introduced to the concept of kuuyam by scholar Charles Sepulveda, a Tongva and Acjachemen. Today, Tongva people currently inhabit Tovangar, known presently as the greater Los Angeles Basin. ""Letting go of that personal attachment to a place takes courage,""ù Xia wrote about the importance of centering kuuyam as California adapts to sea level rise.†""But by being better guests, by reframing our relationship with place and with the native people of this land, could kuuyum ultimately lead to more people taking care of the environment, this coast, this land?""ù† A version of this article appeared on pg. 14 of the Feb. 15, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.†

LAURYN CUMMINS / DAILY NEXUS UC Santa Barbara sociology professors Janice Baldwin and John Baldwin's love story began in an unexpected twist of fate ""î a blind date, or as they fondly recall it, a ""fixed-up blind date.""ù Both hailing from Ohio, their paths crossed at night on a romantic boat ride in Miami.† ""I was going to the University of Miami for summer school,""ù Janice said, ""and we went on a blind date on a fishing boat, over the coral reefs.""ù They admitted that the spark was instant, with John humorously adding, ""We didn't catch anything fish-wise, but we caught each other. That was the biggest catch.""ù Reminiscing about their budding love, John remembered how badly he wanted to take Janice out. ""I invented a second date,""ù he said, ""that was just ""¶ to die for ""¶at one of the famous skin diving beaches in Florida.""ù In less than a year, they both knew the other was the one; John proposed while they were swimming in the Florida Keys on a romantic getaway.† Teaching Human Sexuality, one of UCSB's sociology classes, has only strengthened their love for each other. Janice described how their conversations are so stimulating that they often stay up late into the night, to which John agreed. ""You read a whole bunch of books and you're getting different perspectives and talk about it for hours,""ù he said.† The Baldwins' class is one of UCSB's most popular courses. LAURYN CUMMINS / DAILY NEXUS Learning about human sexuality played a part in the success of their relationship as they were able to define deeper processes, including through the Social Exchange Theory. ""[The theory] gave us the structure for knowing what we want as we exchanged because social exchange is about the constant exchanges that are going on between people,""ù John said. Through discussions on Social Exchange Theory and insights from philosophers like Walter Kaufmann, the couple set high goals for a successful relationship, in contrast to the pain they witnessed in both of their parents' relationships. When identifying the keys to a happy relationship, pure honesty, kindness and trust shone through. Taking a non-traditional approach to Valentine's Day, Janice explained that everyday should be special.""Bringing a card to a person just because it's today is really nice, or John has written me poems and that's really special,""ù she said. ""But it's the smaller things that make up life. It's the little things of every day.""ù† The strength of their bond was palpable.""You know that's true after you've been married as long as we, you know that every day has the potential to be fabulous,""ù John said.

science,UBC professor discusses wildfire mitigation and self-protection at Bren Hall,22-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Kevin Zhang'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-22/ubc-professor-discusses-wildfire-mitigation-and-self-protection-at-bren-hall/,"Most people believe wildfires are a wall of flame that engulfs buildings. Renowned professor and environmental economist says otherwise. He says the culprit is ember branding, the very foundation of a house. Dr. Patrick Baylis from the University of British Columbia presented at UC Santa Barbara's Bren Hall on Feb. 12. He presented his newly published study on wildfire mitigation through federal policies and increased public awareness.† Wildfires have been a persistent and costly environmental issue in California. Over a quarter of the state's population lives in areas with high wildfire risks and although various state and federal policies require homeowners in high risk areas to take precautionary measures, these laws are seldom enforced. In addition, Baylis mentioned that many common wildfire counter measures such as vegetation management actually exacerbates the problem as the natural fire cycle is disrupted, increasing the frequency of wildfires while decreasing native vegetation's resistance.† Baylis' research also examines the financial aspect of wildfire management, citing a large mismatch between local and federal investment in suppression efforts. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal government spends around $2..5 billion dollars per year on wildfire suppression yet total acreage and homes destroyed has been increasing since 2016.† Previous researchers encountered difficulties finding cost effective ways to enforce wildfire prevention regulations. For instance, a wildfire building code was introduced in Oregon but received massive pushback with the lawmaker even receiving death threats from multiple homeowners.† To address the issue of public pushback and lack of standardized practices, Baylis and his team began comparing different incentivization techniques with over 4,000 homeowners in Jackson County, Oregon to figure out methods of establishing a cohesive wildfire suppression system.† Contrary to popular belief, the danger of wildfire actually resides in the embers rather than the flames itself. Construction materials such as wood or bark are highly combustible when in contact with embers. Dead plants and leaves in backyards also speeds up the progress of wildfires. Firebrands from conifers can also fly through the air, sometimes a considerable distance, and ignite homes without the flames ever coming near the property.† To combat this phenomenon, homeowners are advised to set up zones known as defensible spaces by replacing flammable material and debris. However, the cost of establishing defensible space can vary greatly as some properties simply need to be cleaned while others need complete renovations using hardscape materials.† To start, Baylis and his team began distributing flyers around Jackson County. There were four types of flyers distributed ranging from moral suasion to $250-$500 cash subsidies that encouraged residents to contact local fire departments for a defensible space diagnostic. Flyers were randomly distributed, with control groups receiving flyers without the promise of a subsidy.† Unfortunately, the initial set of distributed flyers did not receive the anticipated response, with only 10% of homeowners in the experimental group contacting the local fire department. In an attempt to increase local engagement, Baylis decided to switch the flyers into letter form with fewer pictures and more words describing the importance of defensible space. Surprisingly, the feedback rate nearly doubled.. Such proactivity amongst residents has been unprecedented in previous wildfire studies and is a promising sign for growing public awareness of wildfire risk management.† ""We use our results to calculate spatially differentiated implicit subsidies for homeowners throughout the western United States,""ù said Baylis in his article.""Wildfire protection represents a large transfer of federal and state revenues to homeowners in high-cost places, making it an important mechanism for redistribution to rural and ex-urban areas that has not been fully appreciated by economists.""ù† As climate change continues to alter the occurrence of natural disasters across the world, the cost of policy implementation also rises exponentially ""î and researchers must come up with new adaptive counter measures which must be reflected in public policy.† In the wake of the pilot program's success, Baylis stated that he is excited to continue his study on a broader scale across the American West.† A version of this article appeared on pg. 7 of the Feb. 22, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,UCSB study finds perceived discrimination against bisexual people linked to relative social status,22-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-22/ucsb-study-finds-perceived-discrimination-against-bisexual-people-linked-to-relative-social-status/,"Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have found that, while often experiencing more discrimination than other sexual orientation minority groups, people who identify as bisexual are rarely considered to have been victims of such discrimination when compared to a ""òcompetitor' of a perceived higher social status.† The research team, led by Elizabeth Quinn-Jensen, a fourth-year PhD candidate in UCSB's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, published a paper earlier this month looking at whether bisexual people experience discrimination, and, if so, how often they are perceived as having been discriminated against, depending on their relative social status. Elizabeth Quinn-Jensen is the lead author of the study. She is a fourth year PhD candidate in the UCSB Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Despite a minimal amount of existing research on discrimination against bisexual people, it has been estimated that more Americans identify as bisexual than gay or lesbian, with almost 12% of Generation Z Americans identifying as bisexual. Acknowledging this gap in the literature, Quinn-Jensen and her team were interested in attempting to shed light on discrimination against this group.† ""This research really stemmed from, first of all, my own personal experience as a bisexual woman, but kind of this question that I had noticed was popping up frequently which is ""òcan or do bisexual people even experience discrimination,'""ù Quinn-Jensen said, ""which I thought was an interesting question, because we know from literature and research in this area that bisexual people experience a lot of discrimination by both heterosexual people and gay and lesbian people.""ù After reviewing two decades' worth of lawsuits pertaining to workplace discrimination, Quinn-Jensen found that, of an already very small number of suits filed by people identifying as bisexual, only one was successful in ruling in favor of the bisexual plaintiff. ""So, that got me thinking about how or why might bisexual people be less likely to be seen as targets of discrimination,""ù she said. This study explores the Prototype Model of Attributions to Discrimination, which is essentially a framework that describes how people use ""prototypes,""ù based on physical characteristics, social and cultural roles, etc., in order to determine who is most likely to either be a perpetrator or victim of discrimination, harassment, or violent crimes. Quinn-Jensen and her colleagues, Dr. Zoe Liberman and Dr. Brenda Major of UCSB and Dr. Sara Burke of Syracuse University, saw that the likelihood of whether bisexual people are seen as victims of discrimination tends to be correlated with their relative social status and who they are being compared to. ""[Bisexual people are] thought to be a sexual minority, so they're probably more likely to experience discrimination than heterosexual people,""ù Quinn-Jensen said, ""but they're often believed to have ""òheterosexual privilege,' especially within hetero-passing relationships, and thus are maybe less likely to be seen as targets of discrimination than gay and lesbian people.""ù In order to test this experimentally, the researchers set up three main studies, in which participants ""î all identifying as heterosexual, to minimize bias ""î were asked to read different scenarios related to workplace discrimination. The paper describes how bisexual people often report being fired from their jobs or given unfair performance evaluations by supervisors due to their sexual orientation. A 2022 UC Los Angeles study found that bisexual people are overall less likely (than their gay/lesbian colleagues) to be ""out""ù to their supervisors at work, but those who are experienced high levels of discrimination. In addition, Quinn-Jensen's paper highlights that bisexual people are more likely to report an annual income of less than $30,000, compared to lesbians, gay men or U.S. adults generally, as well as more likely to be living beneath the poverty line. According to Quinn-Jensen, the first study was designed to gauge peoples' initial ""evaluations""ù of a bisexual target. Participants were randomly assigned to one of six possible groups, where they read a scene in which a ""target,""ù who worked at a law firm, applied for but was subsequently denied a funding opportunity after their male boss overheard a conversation regarding their sexual orientation. Participants were then asked to rate the extent to which they believed the target had possibly been a victim of discrimination based on various factors, including sexual orientation.† Consistent with the researchers' hypothesis, participants' rated both the gay/lesbian target and the bisexual target as similarly more likely to have faced sexual orientation discrimination. ""We theorize that because [the participants] only read about one person of one sexual orientation, and they weren't doing these comparisons,""ù Quinn-Jensen said. ""If you just read about a bisexual person experiencing discrimination, the default is that they're probably being compared to a heterosexual person, and so you're like ""òwell of course, they're more likely [to experience discrimination.]'""ù† The second study, on the other hand, introduced a clearly established ""competitor,""ù who won out over the target for the funding opportunity. Specifically, this study compared bisexual women and lesbian women to see if there is a difference in peoples' perceptions of both groups as victims of discrimination. Quinn-Jensen and her colleagues found that, once again consistent with their hypothesis, participants answered that a lesbian woman who lost to a bisexual woman was more likely to have experienced discrimination than a bisexual woman who lost to a lesbian woman.† The third and final study divided participants into groups in which they were presented with scenarios describing either lesbian or bisexual women losing a job opportunity to either a heterosexual or sexual minority competitor. The results of this study showed that participants were similarly likely to say that the lesbian woman had been discriminated against, whether she lost to a bisexual or to a heterosexual competitor. However, participants were more likely to say that the bisexual woman's loss was attributed to discrimination based on sexual orientation when the competitor was heterosexual.† The researchers then repeated this third study with male targets, and found that participants were more likely to perceive gay and bisexual men as equally ""low-status,""ù and thus similarly likely to experience discrimination when the competitor was heterosexual.† Quinn-Jensen believes that these results have to do with how people often invalidate bisexuality, by reducing, for example, bisexual women to being heterosexual or bisexual men to being gay. ""It could be the case that people are ascribing bisexual and gay men to this similar level of status and likelihood of being discriminated against,""ù she said. They also thought that it could simply be due to men being granted less flexibility in their sexual orientation, leading to perceptions that they are similar in status to gay men, or even that because there are more ""out""ù bisexual women than men, bisexual women are seen as a sort of prototypical bisexual. The researchers also found that, after asking participants who they thought bisexual men and women were likely to date in the future, the overwhelming result was that both groups were predicted to be in a relationship with a man. ""It could just be that people were like, ""òwell a bisexual man is more likely to be in a relationship with a man, and so is more likely to experience stigmatization [than a bisexual woman]'""ù Quinn-Jensen said. Quinn-Jensen's previous research on discrimination and violence against the LGBTQ+ community, including a 2021 paper she co-authored on how ""affective disgust""ù plays a role in predicting how gay male homicide victims are perceived, also influenced this paper on discrimination against bisexual people. At the time of researching and writing the 2021 paper, Quinn-Jensen had been reading a lot about different LGBTQ+ groups' success rates in various types of legal cases. ""That is actually how I came across that case review looking at the number of successful bisexual discrimination lawsuits,""ù she said. Despite focusing on theory-driven research, Quinn-Jensen is very interested in how the theory extends to the real world. ""I'm really interested, in particular, in discrimination against the queer and LGBTQ+ community""îthat is one of the overarching areas of research that I'm very passionate about, as being a member of that community,""ù Quinn-Jensen said. ""But I also really like to study what the real-world implications are of this discrimination.""ù Indeed, as the paper discusses, the implications of discrimination ""î conscious or not ""î against bisexual people often reach into the legal system. In all three studies, participants were asked to comment on the legitimacy of hypothetical lawsuits brought forth by heterosexual, lesbian and bisexual targets. The majority of participants both favored lesbian plaintiffs' suits over those of bisexual plaintiffs, as well as viewed the suit of a sexual minority as more legitimate when they lost to a heterosexual defendant, rather than a defendant of the other sexual minority (i.e. bisexual or gay/lesbian.) The research team acknowledges remaining questions that need to be answered, such as whether the sexual identity of the perpetrator (in this case, the boss) may have an effect on the outcome (who received the funding opportunity.) In addition, the researchers recognized the potential for more studies with a more diverse group of participants with regard to sexual identity, as well as looking at contexts other than the workplace. Nevertheless, the researchers emphasize the importance of this study in closing gaps in research regarding bisexual people, and particularly any discrimination they face, as well as in ""open[ing] the door""ù to further research on intermediate identities and discrimination, such as that against biracial people. ""This work is really important because I think there are a lot of beliefs that bisexual people aren't stigmatized or that they aren't experiencing discrimination because they are thought to hold this heterosexual privilege, whereas the literature shows that they are often, in fact they may be more stigmatized or at least more negatively evaluated than even gay and lesbian people,""ù Quinn-Jensen said.† She stressed the need for a shift in mentality, and encouraged reflection about how our socio-cultural biases may be impacting our opinions and actions. ""We need to be careful about how we're thinking of [questions] like ""òcan a bisexual person be a target of discrimination,' and ""òare the prototypes we have about who is more or less likely to be a victim potentially influencing these decisions.'""ù If you are interested in learning more about Quinn-Jensen and her colleagues' research, visit this blog post.† † A version of this article appeared on pg. 7 of the Feb. 22, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus. † CORRECTION [2/22/24, 7:27 p.m.]: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that only one case was successful in ruling against the bisexual plaintiff, that bisexual people may be more likely to be seen as victims of discrimination, and that the third study was then done with male participants. This article has been corrected to reflect that only one case was successful in ruling in favor of the bisexual plaintiff, that bisexual people are in fact less likely to be seen as victims of discrimination, and that the third study was then done with male targets. Additionally, the article has been changed to include a link to the 2022 UCLA study mentioned.†

LAURYN CUMMINS / DAILY NEXUS Over the course of four days, more than 1,000,000 gallons of untreated sewage spilled into the Goleta Slough during the rainstorms earlier this month. The Santa Barbara County Public Health Department estimates that a hole in the main sewer line next to the Santa Barbara Airport released approximately 1 million gallons of sewage beginning on Feb. 17. As it traveled all the way to the beach, the sewage necessitated a closure which was enacted on Feb. 22.†††† This follows a spill that closed Miramar Beach on Feb. 20 after around 2,500 gallons of sewage leaked into Oak Creek next to Sinaloa Drive.† A statement issued by the Goleta Sanitary District (GSD) on Feb. 22 revealed that the Goleta West Sanitary District reached out to GSD on the morning of Feb. 17 regarding assistance needed for the force main sewer line.† Crews brought resources to help immediately, offering examination and cleanup assistance. Substantial equipment and water quality analysis were utilized to investigate the source of the spill, for which rainwater was apparently responsible.† According to GSD, rainwater invades the sewage systems at an overwhelming volume, usually causing these contamination events. The resulting sewage contamination also prompted public health advisories. The Goleta West Sanitary District said there is increased vulnerability from contact with sewage-infected water that can cause various illnesses, including rashes, chills, ear infections, diarrhea, fever and vomiting. Signs were posted along Goleta Beach advising the public to avoid all contact with the water pending further results from water samples. The Goleta Slough spill is the largest to occur in the last 10 years, and over 40 times bigger than the previous record.† While the exact timeline is unknown, Goleta Beach is expected to remain closed until water test results come back clean and bacterial levels return to normal.† A version of this article appeared on pg. 8 of the Feb. 29, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The California Nature Art Museum in Solvang and UC Santa Barbara's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration is teaching people all about the birds and the bees. But not in the way you think.† ""The Birds and the Bees and More: Pollinators""ù exhibition debuts on March 2 and will run until Sept. 2. Four artists whose work celebrates and recognizes the buzzing world of pollinators will be featured. Toronto artist Ava Roth contributes artworks made from natural honeycomb, fusing its patterns and shapes with other creative materials. Susan McDonnell from Minnesota paints more unrecognized pollinators such as bats and butterflies in a glowy, radiant fashion. Documentary photographer Elizabeth Weber focuses on the endangered monarch butterfly and raises awareness about the decline of their population, as well as the importance of encouraging homeowners to add native plant species to their gardens. Cynthia James sheds light on the harm that pollinators experience from pesticides and its damaging effects on flora. Her paintings depict flowers that emanate emotions from despair to anger.† The Cheadle Center at UCSB is dedicated to the conservation of bees and other insects, along with preserving local wildlife habitats in the area. In this collaboration, ""The Birds and the Bees and More: Pollinators""ù exhibition will showcase bee specimens imaged by UCSB student interns at the Cheadle Center. Images of rare, native pollinators such as bees, bats, butterflies and birds from the UCSB Natural History Collections will also be available for viewing. Native bee specimens from the Cheadle Center will be on display, each of which can be inspected by visitors through a magnifying glass. Accompanying each specimen will be a magnified image of the bee for convenient observation.† The Cheadle Center is the head of Big-Bee, a national project involving 13 institutions that aims to create over a million 3D images of bee specimens in order to better study bees and how they might react to climate change. Each bee specimen image showcased in the exhibition is part of this national project. Matthew Rosen, a UCSB student intern at the Cheadle Center and aspiring biologist and naturalist, photographed the Anthophora curta species for the Big-Bee project. ""To photograph the bees we used a technique called focal stacking, where a robot moves the camera millimeters at a time and takes hundreds of pictures which are then combined using special software,""ù Rosen explained. ""This creates one very high-resolution image with the entirety of the bee in focus, rather than just a part of it.""ù Sheccid Rivas Trasvina, a recent UCSB graduate, photographed the Triepeolus sp. and Melissodes tepidus timberlakei bee species, both of which will also be featured in the exhibit. ""I loved being able to look at the finished pictures of the bees and see how much detail we normally can't when using our eyes and how many variations there are between individuals of the same species,""ù Rivas recalls. ""I am excited to have my work be part of this exhibit because I think there is a lot to exchange between the arts and the sciences.""ù Bee specimens courtesy of the UCSB Cheadle Center, including those of species found on campus, will be on display as part of the exhibition. LAURYN CUMMINS / UCSB Katja Seltmann, entomologist and director of the Cheadle Center, is the lead of the Big-Bee project, and her work concentrates on the ecology and conservation of bee biodiversity. Her efforts involve gathering bee image and trait datasets to be accessible through a designated ""Bee Library.""ù Imaging bees to create a large data set would allow researchers to investigate traits such as hairiness and whether they indicate more or less resilience to climate change. ""Bees are declining in numbers and species. My lab and the Cheadle Center are working to help these and other insects by studying their declines from a biodiversity and trait perspective,""ù Seltmann said. ""If we know why our wild bees are declining then we can do something to help.""ù Richard Merrill, a UCSB alum who completed his doctorate degree researching the biodynamics of ecosystems, will be present for a lecture at the California Nature Art Museum on March 10, 2024. Merrill's work at UCSB involved crafting landscapes that would nurture and offer shelter to pollinators and insects alike. His talk will cover pollination ecology and the importance of the California landscape to the attraction of pollinators.

science,"Research in Review: cancer therapy, sea otter ecology, and archaeological dating",29-Feb-24,9:00 AM,['Cassandra Cavallo'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-29/research-in-review-cancer-therapy-sea-otter-ecology-and-archaeological-dating/,"Rac2 Boosts Cancer Therapy:† In a remarkable breakthrough, researchers from UC Santa Barbara's Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology department have cracked a 25-year-old cellular mystery, connecting the gene Rac2 to a rare human immunodeficiency disorder. This groundbreaking research, led by distinguished professors Denise Montell and Meghan Morrissey, not only sheds light on the intricate workings of cell biology but also presents promising avenues for advancing cancer therapies.The focal point of the study is the Rac2 gene, a vital component in cell biology. Rac proteins, including Rac2, play a pivotal role in constructing a cell's cytoskeleton, the structural framework crucial for maintaining cell shape. Montell's team began their research by studying fruit flies, where hyperactive Rac proteins were found to induce cannibalistic behavior in cells, leading to the destruction of entire tissues. The research took an unexpected turn when the researchers learned of a study involving patients with a Rac2 mutation that resulted in a mysterious immunodeficiency disorder. By connecting the dots between fruit fly observations and the patient study, the team discovered that macrophages with active Rac2 were consuming T cells, providing a crucial clue to the immunodeficiency mystery. The implications of this discovery reach beyond immunodeficiency, extending into the realm of cancer treatment. Collaborating with Morrissey, an assistant professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at UCSB, the team explored the potential of enhancing a novel cancer treatment called CAR-M. By integrating activated Rac2 into the mix, researchers observed a significant boost in macrophages' ability to consume cancer cells, laying the foundation for a groundbreaking cancer therapy.The proposed cancer treatment, named RaceCAR-M, involves finely manipulating macrophages to selectively target and consume cancerous cells. The team has filed a provisional patent for this innovative technique and is actively seeking collaborations with biotech companies for further development. Denise Montell expressed her enthusiasm. ""This is my favorite paper so far. We had this 25-year-old cold case in fruit flies, and we solved it,""ù Montell said. ""And that helped us solve the mystery of an unexplained human immunodeficiency. And then we harnessed that knowledge to enhance potential cancer immunotherapy.""ù As researchers continue to delve into the molecular intricacies, the future holds promising developments at the intersection of basic cell biology and therapeutic innovation. Sea Otters Restore Ecosystems: Sea otters are playing a vital role in the ecological restoration of Central California's wetlands, particularly in the Elkhorn Slough, according to a pioneering study led by researchers at UCSB. Published in Nature, the research highlights the remarkable impact of sea otter recolonization on the region's landscape.The study reveals a notable 69% reduction in the erosion of creek banks after the sea otter population fully recovered, defying expectations given factors such as rising sea levels and stronger tidal currents. Marsh and streamside vegetation have also rebounded, offering increased resilience against flooding and wave surges. The key driver behind this rejuvenation is the sea otters' voracious appetite for herbivorous marsh crabs, as explained by co-author Kathryn Beheshti, an assistant researcher at UCSB's Marine Science Institute. Lead author Brent Hughes, an associate professor of biology at Sonoma State University, emphasized the significance of the sea otters' role. ""Our study underscores the far-reaching benefits that can cascade through an ecosystem when a top predator is reintroduced,""ù Hughes said. The sea otters' return to Elkhorn Slough in the mid-1980s and their subsequent expansion into salt marshes have led to the stabilization of salt marshes and creek banks, countering decades of erosion caused by an overpopulation of crabs. Senior author Brian Silliman, a distinguished professor of marine conservation biology at Duke University, posed an intriguing question: ""In how many other ecosystems worldwide could the reintroduction of a former top predator yield similar benefits?""ùThe study's insights challenge the traditional understanding of coastal geomorphology, highlighting the crucial role predators play in shaping tidal creeks. The research, combining field experiments, modeling and before-and-after measurements, provides a compelling case for the far-reaching impacts of reintroducing top predators into ecosystems. The sea otters' role in stabilizing wetlands offers an effective and cost-efficient tool for conservation efforts, allowing natural restoration to occur without extensive human intervention. As the study opens new avenues of exploration, researchers are initiating further projects to understand and enhance the sea otters' impact on ecosystem restoration. Comet Research in Wakulla Springs: In the heart of Wakulla Springs, one of the world's largest and deepest freshwater springs, a team led by UCSB Professor Emeritus James Kennett has unearthed a cosmic time capsule hidden in the aftermath of a fragmented comet's collision with Earth's atmosphere some 13,000 years ago. While the celestial event is already linked to global repercussions such as burning, impact winter and megafauna extinction, it has now emerged as an invaluable tool for dating stone artifacts. Published in the prestigious Nature journal, the study introduces a novel approach centered around the Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) layer, formed during the cosmic impact.†This layer, distinguished by materials forged at temperatures surpassing 2,000 degrees Celsius, is globally distributed, spanning the Americas, Western Europe and the Middle East. Wakulla Springs in northern Florida, a site with a rich history of human habitation, posed unique challenges due to its sandy soils and continuous occupation, complicating conventional dating methods. ""The Florida sites have a certain archaeological sequence of stone tools with only generally known cultural ages,""ù Kennett elaborated. ""The idea was to try and see if we could use the 12,800-year-old YDB to more clearly define the cultural ages and their sequence represented in these sites.""ù  Addressing these challenges, the researchers employed an approach that integrated platinum geochemistry, granulometry, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and dating of stone artifacts. Despite the limitations of OSL dating, the team identified iron-rich microspherules and high platinum concentrations around a meter below the surface at each site ""ì distinctive markers of the YDB layer. ""The layer containing platinum and microspherules is well-dated to 12,000 years ago at many other sites, therefore, it provides a very useful age level for correlation and dating between the sequences at Wakulla,""ù Kennett said. This breakthrough not only ensures precise dating of archaeological sequences but also facilitates correlation across multiple sites, offering a better understanding of the paleohistory of the area. By amalgamating OSL data, the YDB layer and artifact presence, the researchers successfully established relative ages of stone tools pre- and post-YDB formation. ""A lot of archaeological sequences are difficult to date with accuracy, and hence the identification of the YDB layer presents a significant advance,""ù Kennett said. This cosmic time capsule not only sheds light on ancient events but also pioneers a new frontier in archaeological methodology, unraveling the intricate tapestry of human history through meticulous dating and correlation techniques.† A version of this article appeared on pg. 8 of the Feb. 29, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,Simply Stated: How scientifically accurate are this year‚'s Academy Award nominees?,7-Mar-24,9:00 AM,['Emma Holm-Olsen'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-03-07/simply-stated-how-scientifically-accurate-are-this-years-academy-award-nominees/,"Warning: This article contains spoilers about several 2024 Academy Award nominated films. With the Academy Awards fast approaching, many are probably watching and re-watching the nominees, attempting to predict which will be recognized, and which may be ""snubbed,""ù but some of us are interested in something else. Many of this year's nominees grapple with diverse subjects within science and technology, whether they be historical or fictional. How accurately do they portray these scientific topics?† ""Oppenheimer""ù and the atomic bomb Dominating box offices as one of the biggest movies of the year, Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer""ù clearly did a lot right. Based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's book ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,""ù the story follows Oppenheimer as he leads the Manhattan Project, a top-secret team of physicists, engineers and military officials, to develop the world's first atomic bomb. From both a historical and scientific perspective, the movie is impressively accurate. From the initial concerns that a nuclear bomb would set fire to the entire atmosphere, to the relationship between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein at Princeton University, the central plotlines in the film were all true. According to Bird himself, the film didn't leave out any major historical scenes, but there are still some details that were excluded, including the devastating effects of the Trinity test at Los Alamos and the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Chris Griffith, a Manhattan Project historian, described a few other aspects of the project that Nolan got right and wrong. Focusing on Los Alamos, the film largely left out the contributions of the other test sites, like those of Hanford, Washington,† and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. While Los Alamos was essentially the center of the Manhattan Project, the others played roles in the production of materials such as uranium and plutonium that would be used in the Trinity device. While they are briefly referenced in the film's marbles scene, Griffith argues that the exclusion of these other sites may leave the viewer without an accurate grasp on the true scale of the project. Another, albeit minor, aspect which was changed for the screen was that of the Trinity test explosion itself. While Nolan got the timing right (and it should be said that he made sure to use practical effects rather than CGI to maintain as much accuracy as possible), Griffith expresses disappointment at not seeing the characteristic mushroom cloud, which should have followed the light and sound. In addition, Australian nuclear experts have said that the film left out any reference to or depiction of the heat wave that should have immediately followed the explosion. One of the researchers, Dr. Kirrily Rule, went so far as to say that the science of the project was ineffectively conveyed to the audience throughout the film, leaving them with a sense that it's ""too hard.""ù He argues this establishes a disconnect between the viewers and the subject matter.† ""As a physicist watching the movie, I think they could have been much clearer on the science involved,""ù he said.† Nevertheless, whether the film oversimplifies or overcomplicates the exact science behind the Manhattan Project, the film does an effective job at communicating the moral and political implications of the project, and leaves viewers excited to learn more.† Resurrection and ""self""ù in ""Poor Things""ù† A testament to womanhood and self-discovery, ""Poor Things,""ù directed by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, has become another fan favorite this year. The film explores the psychological development of Bella Baxter, a Frankenstein-like creation of her father figure Dr. Godwin Baxter, as she grows into both her own body and the world around her. From the original Frankenstein to our current cultural craze over zombies, reanimation and resurrection are themes which have been explored in popular culture for decades and reflect our society's long-standing fascination with the ability to overcome death. Within science itself, many have taken enormous efforts to research ways to potentially extend lifespans, revive patients who have died and ""î like Dr. Baxter's duck-goats and dog-chickens ""î creating ""chimeras,""ù by mixing and matching the most interesting or strongest attributes of various species. However, side-stepping any obvious ethical issues, is there any actual scientific evidence that Dr. Baxter's creations could theoretically one day be possible? ""Poor Things""ù makes it look so easy: pluck a brain out of one body, open the brain case and set it in. Vo√≠la ""î a new human retaining all motor function and mental capabilities. While there have been quite a few attempts at studying brain tissue revival and even full head and brain transplants, there hasn't been any definitive success. While Bella is the amalgamation of a prenatal brain in an adult woman's body, some researchers, like Sergio Canavero, have been studying the possibility of transplanting older brains from their elderly bodies into younger and healthier bodies. Laboratory trials have attempted the transplants in mice and monkeys, but the fact that the brain is connected to the spinal cord complicates things; While the severing and replacement of a head is one thing, there does not yet exist technology that can facilitate the complete reconnection of the brain and spinal cord (at least in humans.) And, even if a full brain transplant became possible, there is no concrete understanding of how the brain would then continue to develop once inside the new body. In ""Poor Things,""ù since Bella's body stays the same, the film focuses on exploring the character's psychological progression. However, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the film's depiction of her mental development is not entirely scientifically accurate. The French philosopher Ren√© Descartes argued that the mind and body are completely separate, and that each could operate independently of the other""îa theory clearly at play in the film. Many contemporary psychologists, however, believe that the mind and body are intrinsically connected. Regarding childrens' development, psychologist Phillippe Rochat, asserts that the body plays a major role in the mind's development, and that over the course of one's life, the two work together to inform an individual's ""sense of self.""ù Nevertheless, while Baxter herself may be a work of fiction, if the incredible slew of medical advancements of the last century is any indication, human brain transplants may be commonplace in another hundred years.†† ""The Creator""ù and artificial intelligence† With tools like ChatGPT, facial recognition software and virtual assistants (like Siri or Alexa) becoming more and more popular and abundant, many have expressed concerns regarding how much power and autonomy these technologies really have ""î and whether they may be developed to a point in which they have minds of their own. Director Gareth Edwards' most recent film, ""The Creator,""ù explores these themes to an extreme. The story follows Joshua, a soldier in a deadly war between humans and robots, whose mission is to find and eliminate a mysterious artificial intelligence (AI) weapon that the robots have been developing. Finding that the weapon is in fact a young ""òsynthetic' girl, however, and in the process discovering more about his deceased wife, Joshua is forced to face his previous assumptions about the inhumanity and danger of AI, and rethink his beliefs about what constitutes humanity. The film does an effective job at creating a story which evokes an emotional response from the audience, interestingly more so toward the machines than toward the human characters. Film critics have acknowledged this, and subsequently drawn connections between this story and that of the iconic film ""Blade Runner.""ù In both stories, attention is drawn to how the robots are ""more human than human.""ù This sentiment is evident in several scenes in ""The Creator""ù which demonstrate the cruelty humans inflict on the robots and those protecting them. Yet, does the film perpetuate inaccuracies and stereotypes regarding the essence of artificial intelligence and their potential to equal or even surpass humans? Perhaps. The movie takes place in 2070, 15 years after robots detonated a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles, killing millions of people. This is a theme popular culture has latched on to in recent years; whether AI might get to a point where it can overrun humanity. Many experts, however, have assuaged these concerns, maintaining that while AI is becoming more sophisticated every day, it is highly unlikely that it will ever ""òtake over the world,' at least in the way movies like ""The Creator""ù portray it. Robots have been trained to do everything from playing chess to writing novels, but so far none have been able to truly exhibit (that is, not programmed or mimicked) emotion, creativity or intuition ""î all defining characteristics of humans. Some researchers, however, believe that in the next few years AI systems could get to a point where, if granted enough access to global systems, like the stock markets or military, and depending on what they were programmed to do, they could get out of control. Like with any technology, though, the risk arises less with artificial intelligence itself than with how we choose to use it.† A version of this article appeared on pg. 12 of the March 7, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,"Simply Stated: What is endometriosis, and why is it so much more than bad periods?",11-Mar-24,2:15 PM,['Audrey Moeller'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-03-11/simply-stated-what-is-endometriosis-and-why-is-it-so-much-more-than-bad-periods/,"March is Endometriosis Awareness Month, and there's no better time to talk about this invisible but terrible disease. Endometriosis and all of its related chronic conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome, adenomyosis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, interstitial cystitis and pelvic floor dysfunction are no joke. Although it was estimated that one in every 10 women around the globe have endometriosis, the vast majority of those 178 million people have either never heard of endometriosis, have been misdiagnosed or don't have the opportunity to find a specialist in the field.† Endometriosis is an invisible but incredibly debilitating disease. It has been referred to as the ""òmissed disease' due to its unclear presentation and inconsistencies in its diagnosis and management. Cases have skyrocketed in recent years, and almost everyone with a uterus experiences endometriosis-related symptoms to some extent. During this modern epidemic, it is essential that those who are at risk of being affected are educated regarding symptoms to watch for and are familiar with lifestyle changes that can alleviate symptoms and slow the growth of diseased tissue. It is also important that people feel validated in their quest for medical attention. Advocacy among both women and men is critical in order to gain recognition by insurance companies and government funding for scientific research.† The World Health Organization characterizes endometriosis as an incurable disease in which tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus. Similar to healthy uterine lining, this abnormal tissue builds up, sheds, and bleeds with each period. However, since endometrial tissue is trapped outside the uterus, the blood and shed tissue can't leave the body through the vagina. Instead, it causes extremely painful internal scarring, adhesions (when tissue sticks together) and lots of inflammation in the pelvic region and sometimes higher. Many patients experience debilitating pelvic pain, heavy bleeding, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, bladder pain, hormonal imbalances that increase the risk for acne, vaginal infections, anxiety and depression. Due to this broad range of symptoms, patients often go undiagnosed for years until the severity of their discomfort impedes on daily tasks and prompts them to seek urgent help.† Endometriosis can only be diagnosed via post-surgery pathology analysis. However, gynecologists can offer symptom-management treatment options if it is suspected that a patient might have endometriosis. Birth control pills, IUDs and similar solutions can influence hormone levels to lessen the frequency and severity of menstrual cycles and slow down the growth of suspected endometriosis tissue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also commonly prescribed for pain. However, for many endometriosis patients, symptom management does not provide enough relief. After what is often seven or more years of extreme pain, the central nervous system of endometriosis patients is extremely overwhelmed with pain signals, leading to tense pelvic floor muscles. These muscles must be able to relax in order to start releasing built up tension within the pelvis. A referral to pelvic floor physical therapy is an incredibly powerful tool for releasing this tension.† Since most individuals with endometriosis go misdiagnosed for years before realizing they might have the disease, the large amount of NSAID usage from constantly taking painkillers often lead to a gut condition called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, more commonly known as leaky gut syndrome. Essentially, the mucus lining the gut weakens so much that harmful bacteria escapes the gut, causing bloating, acne and other symptoms of poor digestion due to inability to digest high fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) foods. FODMAP is an umbrella term used to categorize foods that have a complex carbohydrate structure that is difficult to break down for people with specific gut conditions.† The food we eat has a huge effect on how we feel, so it is important to fuel the body with foods that won't trigger pain or discomfort. For SIBO management, it is recommended to also avoid large amounts of high FODMAP foods. There are a broad range of foods that fall into this category, from lactose and gluten to beans and certain fruits or vegetables. For endometriosis management overall, it is recommended to avoid highly inflammatory foods that induce cramping, which can be achieved by limiting the consumption of dairy, gluten, soy, caffeine, alcohol and processed foods or oils. Acidic foods such as coffee and tomatoes may also need to be reduced or eliminated from the diet to address interstitial cystitis (IC). These diets may also help with the management of hormonal imbalances and other related conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).† Finally, it is time to address the elephant in the room: surgery. If it is strongly suspected that a patient has endometriosis, a specialist will plan an outpatient robotic laparoscopic surgery date. A post-op pathology report is needed to officially diagnose endometriosis tissue and is usually needed for the insurance coverage of the operation. These surgeries can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but are absolutely necessary when your life is being halted by endometriosis pain. In some cases, procedures will need to be repeated multiple times throughout a patient's life, with many added expenses to protect fertility. Adenomyosis, which is a very painful condition in which diseased endometrial tissue is in the muscles of the uterus, can only be removed via a hysterectomy.† Endometriosis is a complex and relatively poorly understood disease that can affect anyone with a uterus. While it is a disease with an enormous health care burden, there is no cure due to lack of research funding. After reading this article, if you're thinking ""this sounds like me,""ù you're not alone. So many people are silently suffering from endometriosis and have no idea that their symptoms fall under a very real condition. Self-advocacy for medical attention is essential, and holistic aspects of general self-care can be reinforced at any time. Maintaining a gut-friendly diet, limiting exposure to toxins like bisphenol A (BPA) and harsh chemicals, exercising, drinking enough water, practicing meditation and recording when and in what way your body feels off are all great ways to stay in touch with your health and live a pain-free life.

science,Simply Stated: Do we really only use only 10% of our brains?,11-Apr-24,9:25 AM,['Cassandra Cavallo'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-11/simply-stated-do-we-really-only-use-only-10-of-our-brains/,"NATHAN VILLASE√ëOR / DAILY NEXUS Nestled within the fortress of our craniums, the human brain stands as one of the most complex structures in the known universe. It orchestrates our thoughts, emotions and behaviors with a level of sophistication that has inspired centuries of scientific exploration. Despite the wealth of scientific knowledge gained through decades of research, a widely circulated myth has captured the public's imagination: the belief that humans only use 10% of their brains.† This myth offers an alluring narrative ""î that we're sitting on a goldmine of untapped cognitive resources, ready to transform our abilities if only we could access that dormant 90%. Yet, delving into its origins reveals a complex interplay of historical influences, media representations and deeply rooted cognitive biases. Hollywood, for example, has played a significant role in perpetuating the myth through films like ""Limitless""ù and ""Lucy,""ù blurring the lines between fiction and reality. Additionally, the self-help industry, driven by profit motives, often misleads individuals with promises of unlocking unused cognitive abilities. Exploring the evolution of the brain offers tangible evidence against the 10% myth. The brain, despite comprising only 2% of the body's weight, demands over 20% of its energy. From an evolutionary standpoint, maintaining such an energetically costly organ would be impractical if 90% remained inactive. The fallacy of the 10% myth is further highlighted by studies showing how lesions in the temporal lobe lead to memory deficits, and how damage to the frontal cortex affects executive function and decision-making. Neuroscientists and clinicians routinely observe how damage to specific regions yields consequential impairments, challenging the simplistic notion that only 10% of the brain actively contributes to our cognitive functions. Recent advancements in neuroimaging technology have shattered the illusion of the 10% brain myth. Studies utilizing EEGs, PET scans and fMRI machines capture continuous and purposeful engagement across the entirety of the brain, dismissing the idea that significant portions remain dormant. Containing over 100 billion nerve cells, the brain has evolved through the ages to function at optimal efficiency, contradicting the idea of vast inactive regions. The promise of unlocking the other 90% of our cognitive potential may sound appealing, but scientific evidence suggests that our brains are already functioning at full capacity. The origins of the 10% brain myth are elusive, but some clues point to William James, a Harvard psychologist and philosopher. In 1907, James wrote about humans using only a fraction of their potential, which over time transformed into the notion that we only use 10% of our brains. This misinterpretation gained momentum in the self-help movement of the 1920s, evolving into a catchy phrase that has persisted for over a century. Self-help marketers, driven by profit motives, have long tried to sell the promise that they can help you unlock a greater portion of your cognitive abilities. Unfortunately, the self-help industry merely provides the illusion of progress and not progress itself. The reality is that every individual, assuming they do not suffer from any brain damage, has the capacity to consistently utilize all of their cognitive abilities.† As we now know, the idea that we only use 10% of our brains turns out to be 100% false.† It would be nice to think that if we could just access that untapped 90%, we would find a direct route to achieving our dreams. Needless to say, there is no substitute for hard work and practice when it comes to success. There is no magic pill, miracle cure or special potion that will expand one's brain capacity and unlock their full potential.† Nevertheless, understanding the scientific truth about the brain in a world of misinformation is empowering, and we can take comfort in knowing that our efforts and achievements are not limited by an arbitrary 10% cap.  A version of this article appeared on pg. 10 of the April 11, 2024 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

science,OPINION: ChatGPT: Friend or Foe?,11-Apr-24,9:28 AM,['Tara Mandrekar'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-11/opinion-chatgpt-friend-or-foe/,"It's 10:37 p.m. on a Thursday, and you just remembered you have a discussion post due at midnight. You're struggling to craft an acceptable response in time to catch the last Bill's Bus downtown when you remember your friend raving about ChatGPT the week before. This easy solution is too tempting to ignore, and you quickly plug in the prompt, copying and pasting the answer ChatGPT spits out into the submission box. Does this one-time weakness become the new way you do all of your assignments? Your professors have been wondering the same thing. If you talk to members of faculty, you'll quickly find there's little consensus beyond the recognition that it raises complex questions about how they teach and how students learn. I had the opportunity to learn about the situation by conducting interviews and focus groups at UC Santa Barbara. I found that professors are trying to adapt to the rise of large language models, like ChatGPT, without established guidelines or a clear picture of how their students are currently using it.†† Some are banning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and returning to in-person tests to avoid the potential for cheating. Others are putting effort into creating assignments that challenge students to use ChatGPT to produce answers and then compare or critique its responses against their own. A third group of professors reports encouraging students to use ChatGPT's assistance with all their assignments, using the logic that it evens out the playing field and provides opportunities for students who have less resources to keep up.† Despite this diversity in classroom policies, students overwhelmingly report feeling afraid of using ChatGPT because of how often they've been warned against it. The majority of students I met described feeling confused about faculty expectations, with one student bluntly stating that they ""wish professors wouldn't be so weird about it.""ù Students who do use it say they largely use it either as a learning resource to help them study, break apart difficult concepts, generate ideas, improve their writing skills or to complete ""busywork""ù when they're feeling overwhelmed and burned out. A minority of students also raised concerns about the ethical issues surrounding large language models, including replicating bias and a lack of transparency around the information AI's use as sources.† One of the more effective solutions to the issue of AI in the classroom appears to be integrating ChatGPT into coursework with an emphasis on critiquing its responses.† The assignment overview of one such task, assigned in an upper division political science course, states, ""An important part of a university education today is gaining systematic experience with AI tools and developing skills for using these tools intelligently and responsibly. In this assignment, you will take some steps in that direction.""ù† To complete the project, students were given an essay prompt and asked to have ChatGPT produce an answer. Then, they were asked to evaluate some of the strengths and weaknesses of the response before editing and rewriting the essay to include their own perspectives. Students from that class who were interviewed largely reported feeling excited by the unique assignment and described learning a lot about not only what ChatGPT was capable of but also the areas in which it wasn't helpful.† Outside of these kinds of structured assignments, students lack a real understanding of how to navigate ChatGPT ethically and effectively, so they either use it without fully understanding its limitations or don't use it at all. They feel caught between professors who encourage them to use it without explaining how and those who tell them not to use it at all without offering a way to overcome existing issues of burnout.† The issue becomes more pressing when you factor in the importance of AI literacy for career readiness. Questions arise about the university's responsibility to its students to prepare them to leave college as efficient workers and hireable job candidates. One student, considering this problem, asked why they should be expected not to use a tool that they will need to be familiar with when entering the job environment. Another student, adding to this, argued that if the university isn't letting them use ChatGPT, it should provide better resources for those tasks where students most want to use AI. The simplest solution might seem to be letting students do what they want, but that would ignore the complicated realities of AI. Some professors point out that it's a potentially dangerous resource for students who are new to university learning; if students haven't honed their foundational critical thinking skills, they won't be able to engage with ChatGPT's answers in a meaningful way.† This is a concern echoed by students who noted that they feel like they're just ""turning their brain off""ù and aren't doing any critical thinking when they use AI. Some students also pointed out that they weren't impressed by ChatGPT-generated responses, such as one who noted, ""it'll give a really eloquent answer, but it doesn't necessarily give the right answer or the most detailed answer.""ù Many students seem to consider ChatGPT a supplemental resource rather than a catch-all solution to the burdens of coursework.† What I learned from talking with students is that some professors' policies of restricting use appear to be ineffective. More importantly, restrictions limit some of the positive contributions† students feel ChatGPT can make for them.† ""If they taught us how to use it as a tool of learning, they wouldn't have to restrict it so much,""ù one student argued.† Some first-generation students emphasized that ChatGPT offers the opportunity to fill some of the gaps in learning they had from high school, provide information about resources they don't normally have access to and make them more confident in their abilities because they know they have it as a resource. My discussions with faculty and students convinced me that AI can, and should be, introduced as a tool of learning. Students need to learn how to build skills that can't be replaced by AI while also building literacy about how to use AI as a tool of learning and efficiency. As with any other tool, students must be taught to wield it ethically and effectively, but the current environment provides little room for that.† Professors, responding to the pressures of increased instances of cheating in their courses, are doing their best to adapt their coursework with the little information they have. Students, feeling the pressures from faculty, are either shying away from ChatGPT entirely or using it without a full understanding of how the technology could help, rather than replace, their learning journey.† At a major research university like UCSB, it's difficult for professors to carve out time to draw up new lesson plans and attend AI trainings alongside the constraints that come with being a full time researcher and educator. It becomes even more difficult when faculty has a foggy picture of how it's currently being used, so they operate on the assumption that all students will use it when given the chance.† Students and professors are not only unsure about the technology, but they are unsure about one another. This is making things worse than they have to be. The next step toward solutions† is consistent dialogue among professors, graduate students and undergraduates. The university has been slow to react to these needs, meaning that current students aren't being prepared for their careers and incoming students may be deterred from attending a school that does so little to prepare them for an AI-assisted future.† It's crucial that UCSB administration recognizes the importance of centering student interests and building support for faculty in their attempts to develop standards around what an effective AI policy looks like. Only with this emphasis do we move away from the current state of confusion towards a sustainable and responsible technological future.

science,Going Deeper: A look into scientific diving at UCSB,18-Apr-24,9:00 AM,['Olivia Lohrer'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-18/going-deeper-a-look-into-scientific-diving-at-ucsb/,"Despite the fact that the ocean covers approximately 70% of Earth's surface and dominates our global climate and weather systems, humans have relatively little understanding of what happens beneath the surface. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as of 2023, only 24.9% of the seafloor has been mapped. The ocean is commonly described as the last unexplored frontier, given that more of the moon and planet Mars have been mapped than the ocean floor, and funding for space exploration outpaces ocean exploration significantly. Scientists worldwide dedicate their livelihoods to growing these statistics, including many of UC Santa Barbara's community members. Much of this revolutionary research can be ""ì and certainly is ""ì conducted within the laboratory, however, it can also be done by researchers wearing thick wetsuits and air tanks on their backs as they descend to depths between 30 and 100 feet.† UCSB's unique proximity to the Pacific Ocean provides ample opportunity to conduct research of this nature. ""UC Santa Barbara's Scientific Diving and Boating Program is one of the oldest, largest, and most active scientific diving and boating programs of its kind,""ù according to UCSB's Marine Operations Diving & Boating page. Still, many may not be aware of the specific implications of ""sci-diving.""ù ""Scientific diving to me is being as comfortable as you can underwater while also having a lot of tasks thrown at you,""ù Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research lab (SBC-LTER) assistant specialist Darrin Ambat said. ""When people get into diving they think it's going to be a great vacation, diving in these tropical regions, and it's really warm. But scientific diving is definitely a job.""ù Breaking the surface with scientific diving is no simple endeavor. Besides the high price tag of the necessary classes and equipment, divers who already have their open water scuba certification""ìand have a minimum of 12 logged dives (four of which must have taken place in water of 70 degrees Fahrenheit or below) ""ì must complete a 100-hour, 12-day dive safety course that is offered twice a year by a Dive & Boat Safety Officer. The course includes online lessons, classroom instruction, pool diving sessions, and open water diving at Campus Point and Catalina Island.† The course strives to address the unique demands of scientific diving. As UCSB's Boating Safety Officer, Carly Haack oversees many of the logistics, equipment, and safety concerns of scientific diving.† Haack explained how, as students make the transition from recreational to scientific diving, they must become accustomed to less than favorable conditions such as poor visibility or cold temperatures. The conditions may not be ideal, ""but it's totally fine for getting good data,""ù Haack said. Additionally, the scientific diving course heavily emphasizes what she calls ""task-loading.""ù† ""As you are going from a student in a dive class to starting to work for the labs, [there are] a lot of different things that you are adding onto diving all at once,""ù Haack said, who believes that one of the biggest challenges of scientific diving is continually remembering basic safety of principles, even when engaged in meticulous scientific work. ""Even though I'm looking at all of these things, I also need to remember to check in with my buddy, or look at my air.""ù Additional learning curves include working with various pieces of gear that can not be lost underwater, as well as collaborating with a team when verbal communication is not possible. Ambat described these as the inevitable challenges that come with conducting research ""in a foreign environment that we're not really made to be in for all that long.""ù Despite the rigor of the required safety course, upon completion, divers are prepared to participate in underwater research through a lab on campus.† Third-year aquatic biology major Hailey Springer received her scientific diving certification over spring break of 2023. Since then, she has worked alongside Ambat as an intern in the SBC-LTER lab.† ""The idea of being able to go out on a Thursday in the middle of the week, I had a lecture that morning and now I get to go dive and it's considered school really appealed to me,""ù said Springer. ""It's really wonderful to be at a school where there's such a big community for scientific diving. We're so close to the beach, and we have access to a boatyard and different people who want to conduct this research. It's just a great place for it.""ù† Within the UCSB Marine Science Institute, three primary laboratories utilize scientific diving to conduct their research: Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans, the Moorea Coral Reef Long-Term Ecological Research (field operations take place at Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia) and SBC-LTER.† Since it was established in 2000, SBC-LTER has primarily focused its research on giant kelp. Their current research explores how both natural forces and human activities alter the structure and function of kelp forest ecosystems, which is made possible through direct observation.† SBC-LTER conducts their research at thirteen dive sites, with nine located along the coast of mainland Santa Barbara and four along Santa Cruz Island. The sampling sites that they most frequently dive for their monthly giant kelp net primary production research are USS Mohawk CGC Veterans Memorial Reef, Arroyo Burro Beach and Arroyo Quemada Beach. According to Ambat, SBC-LTER divers measure a variety of community characteristics within and surrounding the kelp forests, including invertebrate, fish, algae size and abundance, habitat cover, and oceanographic conditions such as dissolved oxygen, light, temperature, and pH. Additionally, SBC-LTER divers continuously monitor and maintain underwater oceanographic sensors for year-round data collection. After a dive, researchers at SBC-LTER will transfer the data that is recorded on their slate, which are submersible writing utensils used for underwater record keeping, to a computer where the interns enter it into their database. After an intern reviews it and it goes through statistical programming data checks by Ambat himself, it is published on the SBC-LTER website for public access.† As one of the student interns working with SBC-LTER, Springer emphasized the long-term significance of being involved with this research.† ""Over years and years, twenty years, this data is going to be so important to compare and see how the Santa Barbara channel has changed""¶""ù Springer said. ""These smaller things are some of the most important stuff because it's what is going to be at the core of a lot of research in the future.""ù Ambat described the value of scientific diving in advancing our collective understanding of the synergistic variables that shape marine ecosystems. ""You can read all these papers,""ù he said. ""But there's something to say about being out there and seeing it for yourself.""ù†

science,Methane-measuring satellite takes off from Santa Barbara,18-Apr-24,9:00 AM,['Qien Feng'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-18/methane-measuring-satellite-takes-off-from-santa-barbara/,"On March 4, SpaceX launched the Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base one hour away from UC Santa Barbara. On board the rocket was Vandenberg Space Force Base, a satellite capable of mapping methane emissions across the globe. The satellite was launched from SpaceX's 10th transporter mission. It is a rideshare program that allows governmental or private entities to launch payloads into space via Falcon 9.† MethaneSAT is a project not affiliated with SpaceX but is envisioned and born from a collaboration between cross-disciplinary fields of the sciences; the principal lead of this mission, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), brought in partners from academia, private technology companies, space agencies, and philanthropic organizations to make MethaneSAT a reality.† The Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Harvard John A/ Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences were also involved in MethaneSAT's technical strategy planning stage. They completed the final protocols and set up the official launch date for MethaneSAT. BAE Systems, a private aerospace company, developed the spectrometer instrument on MethaneSAT, a key component of the satellite that is responsible for methane measurement. The fully equipped satellite is then carried using Blue Cayon's spacecraft bus called the X-SAT.† The New Zealand Space Agency brought in remote sensing technology specific to capturing agricultural emissions, and they operate MethaneSAT's Control Center that monitors the satellite currently in orbit. Google will be providing computing capacities for MethaneSAT's data transfer and storage.† Aside from carbon dioxide,methane is the second biggest contributor to global warming but has a much shorter lifespan than carbon dioxide. The motivation behind MethaneSAT is that cutting down methane's production brings more immediate results within the next decades.† MethaneSAT's mission is to collect data on methane emissions and transfer these data into information useful for policy decision making. MethaneSAT is not the first methane measuring satellite in the world, but its ability to determine a large area's methane level and detect methane concentrations on specific pinpoints confirms its potential to collect a wide range of promising data.† This data will also be made public to incentivize private sectors and companies to cut down their emissions on methane or look for more sustainable practices.† Some of the main features on the satellite include an infrared sensor and spectrometer that allows MethaneSAT to take high resolution measurements on methane emissions while in orbit.†† Before the satellite launch, the team developed MethaneAIR. This project was used as a test model for MethaneSAT; methane measurement devices were installed onto a jet aircraft instead of a satellite. The feedback from these test flights were used in instrument revisions and strategic plannings for MethaneSAT. This project successfully mapped out methane emissions from the Uinta and Permian Basins. The data is available via Google Earth Engine. The aircraft used for this mission is provided and developed by IO Aerospace.† MethaneSAT is currently in orbit to fulfill its mission of data collection, and the data will be sent back to Earth later this year. It is unknown whether the EDF has future plans for MethaneSAT as it continues its journey in space. Nonetheless, the data MethaneSAT is collecting will be a valuable addition to the scientific community.

science,Marijuana and munchies: A possible homeopathic solution,25-Apr-24,9:00 AM,['Tanvi Ladha'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-25/marijuana-and-munchies-a-possible-homeopathic-solution/,"At the heart of cannabis culture, beyond the red eyes, giggles and relaxation, lies an indescribable feeling: the ""munchies.""ù From Snoop Dogg's ""Smoke Weed Everyday""ù to ""That ""ò70s Show,""ù the ""munchies""ù have been popularized as a cultural badge of the stoner lifestyle. But beyond the media's comical depiction of this behavior, how does a puff lead to popcorn, pretzels and Pop-Tarts?† Marijuana, colloquially known as weed, herb, pot, bud or even Mary Jane, comes from the dried flowers of the plants known as Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica. Marijuana's active ingredient is tetrahydrocannabinol or THC which is known for its mind-altering effects. After using marijuana, the senses of smell and taste become more acute and flavors of food seem to be experienced at much higher levels. According to Smithsonian Magazine, our brains typically produce their own chemicals called cannabinoids that fit into receptors in our brain from the endocannabinoid system. This naturally occurring system ""helps to control emotions, memory, pain sensitivity and appetite.""ù THC fits into these same receptors and is able to mimic the activity that our natural chemicals are responsible for with more intensity. A study from Nature Neuroscience verified the region of the brain that plays a role in munchies. The researchers dosed one group of mice with THC, while keeping a sober control group. The high mice sniffed oils from bananas and almonds much more intensely than the group of mice who were not dosed with THC. The researchers also performed this experiment on genetically engineered mice that did not have a certain type of cannabinoid receptor and found that, even if these mice were given THC, it had no effect in increasing their appetite. The studies' findings confirmed that the ""munchies effect""ù relied on the part of the brain connected to the endocannabinoid system. Other research found that the drug effects the part of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens, which plays a primary role in pleasure and reward by increasing the release of dopamine that occurs when eating while high. Alternative research has also found that THC interacts with receptors in the hypothalamus by causing the hormone ghrelin to be released, which triggers the feeling of hunger.† All of these effects involve the brain's natural endocannabinoid system. THC and marijuana manipulate the system that regulates our senses. While the munchies have become a source of humor and fun in media and stoner culture, recent research is exploring how marijuana's appetite-stimulating effects can be used to benefit patients that have a suppressed appetite.† Researchers from Washington State University looked deeper into these hunger-inducing benefits. According to a press release from WSU, this research ""could pave the way for refined therapeutics to treat appetite disorders faced by cancer patients as well as anorexia and potentially obesity.""ù Further research connecting cannabis' interactions on the brain with neurons as well as the metabolic system will study harnessing the appetite-promoting feeling into a patient's actions. So, in addition to the countless laughs and cravings and comedic media stories, the same plant may be responsible for improved medical treatment. Who knows what untapped potential marijuana might have?† UCSB's Alcohol & Drug Program offers informative pages on cannabis as well as other drugs.

science,Faculty Feature: Dr. Jean-Marie Volland‚'s road to UCSB,25-Apr-24,9:00 AM,"['Alexander Micsa', 'Leah Cierzan']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-25/faculty-feature-dr-jean-marie-vollands-road-to-ucsb/,"Dr. Jean-Marie Volland, an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at UC Santa Barbara, is delving into the micro-world beyond the scope of the microscope. He discovered a species of bacterium called Thiomargarita magnifica, a microorganism so large in size that a single cell can be seen with the naked eye. This is the largest bacteria ever to be found, measuring up to 0.8 inches. Additionally, he found that within the bacteria were structures called pepins, similar to the nuclei in our own cells, with over 11,000 genes that could potentially lead to new antibiotics being produced. He is among the first researchers to discover bacteria of this size and its intracellular compartments.† ""Microbes have been here since nearly the dawn of time, inhabiting every corner of the world, from the deepest oceans to the skies above and even in and on our own bodies,""ù Volland said. ""Yet, despite centuries of study, we've barely scratched the surface of understanding them.""ù Volland's research seeks to deepen the knowledge of uncultivated microbes that have not yet been cultured in a lab. Genomic techniques and microscopy are used by Volland and his lab to study microbes from lesser-explored environments like hydrothermal vents and mangroves. Not only does he aim to identify their characteristics, but also the reason for their existence.† Volland joined the UCSB campus in Nov. 2023. His journey, though, is a unique one. Growing up in Guadalupe, he has always been passionate about freediving and exploring the marine life of the island. In the third year of his bachelor's degree there, he discovered his passion for research while interning at a lab where he collected samples from different places around the island. While pursuing his master's degree, Volland began to study microbiology and was intrigued by the cellular structures he was studying. ""I started to use electron microscopy to study the structure and organization of cells and I was completely amazed by the beauty and complexity of life at the cellular level,""ù Volland said. ""It was like discovering a completely new and invisible world.""ù†† He went on to continue his academic career in Guadeloupe with a Ph.D. at the University of Antilles. He studied the beneficial symbioses, long-term biological interactions between two different species of sea snails and microscopic organisms called Sporozoans. Following a gap year, Volland completed two postdoctoral positions at the University of Vienna. This time, he focused on chemosynthetic symbiosis, a type of symbiotic relationship in which microbes use chemical energy to create biomass that can feed animals and protists living near hydrothermal vents.† Before becoming an assistant professor at UCSB, Volland was a scientist at the Laboratory for Research in Complex Systems. He was hosted as an affiliate scientist at the Joint Genome Institute, a facility at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. There, he led the pioneering research on giant chemosynthetic bacteria. At UCSB, he is excited to continue exploring the uncharted territories of microbial life and hopes to use the new CryoEM facility to perform cryo-electron microscopy directly on campus. ""This will allow us to visualize frozen-hydrated microbes in their close-to-native state with molecular resolution,""ù Volland said.† Aside from hypothesis-driven science, Volland believes curiosity and observation-driven research is essential. He hopes to continue discovery-based and exploratory projects in his lab.† Volland is excited to not only continue challenging what is known about his field of study but also inspire the next generation of scientists at UCSB.

science,Simply Stated: The science behind blacking out,2-May-24,9:00 AM,['Katharine Chi'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-02/simply-stated-the-science-behind-blacking-out/,"NATHAN VILLASENOR / DAILY NEXUS After a night of heavy drinking and regrets, one can experience fear and anxiety when all the memories of the previous night are nowhere to be found. Per the definition of the† National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, alcohol-related blackouts are gaps in memory of events that occurred while intoxicated. Blackouts occur when a person consumes enough alcohol that it temporarily blocks the transfer of short-term to long-term memory storage in the brain region named the hippocampus. Due to the overconsumption of alcohol, memory consolidation is unable to occur.† Blackouts are not equivalent to passing out ""ì falling asleep or losing consciousness from alcohol consumption. During blackouts, the person is still awake but memories cannot form in the brain. Blackouts can transition to passing out depending on how much alcohol is consumed.† In reference to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism website, there are two types of blackouts: ""fragmentary blackouts""ù and ""en bloc""ù blackouts. Fragmentary blackouts are when memories between events are missing and the overall recollection of the time period is spotty. En bloc blackouts are when the person is in a complete state of amnesia often for several hours. This is the most severe form of blackouts and typically in this state, memories of the events cannot be formed and usually cannot be recovered.† Blackouts tend to occur when the blood alcohol concentration (BACs) reaches 0.16 percent or higher. At these levels of BAC, cognitive functions such as attention, judgment and decision-making are severely impaired. Because of the degree of impairment and high levels of BAC, the associated blackouts make intoxication especially more dangerous. With that being said, people can still experience blackouts at lower levels of BAC when drinking and taking sleep and anti-anxiety medications.† According to research done at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, blackouts are more likely to occur when alcohol enters the bloodstream too quickly, thus causing BAC levels to spike. BAC levels can increase rapidly when drinking on an empty stomach or consuming a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time. It should be noted that there are various factors to drinking and BAC levels such as gender, weight and type of drink.† There is not enough research that covers the long term effects of heavy drinking on the brain, but there is research done at Duke University by Aaron M.White that indicates that overconsumption of alcohol damages the long term potentiation of neural signaling in the hippocampus and associated brain regions. With constant overconsumption, there are ranging levels of effects with various levels of severity: from momentary slips in memory to more permanent conditions of brain damage. Chronic alcohol consumption has been associated with damaging the frontal lobe of the brain, which controls behavior, personality, and both short and long term memory formation and recollection. With constant damage to the front lobe, the associated cognitive functions can be permanently impaired. Blackouts are common amongst college students and other young adults, but according to College and Underage Drinking Prevention Research done by Aaron White, the frequency of blackouts is associated with alcohol-related consequences such as missing work and school, a lower grade point average and being injured.† A blackout is not necessarily an indication of alcohol use disorder, but it is a cause for concern and should prompt people to reflect on their relationship with alcohol and consider reaching out to their healthcare providers to talk about their drinking.

science,Are we fossil fools? A wake-up call for Earth Day,2-May-24,9:00 AM,['Sophia Delap'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-02/are-we-fossil-fools-a-wake-up-call-for-earth-day/,"ZOE GONZALES / DAILY NEXUS In honor of this year's Earth Day, two determined engineers by the names of Craig Smith (former UCLA faculty member and COO of international engineering and construction management firm Daniel, Mann, Johnson and Mendenhall (DMJM) and William Fletcher (former senior vice president of Rockwell International Corporation) presented their key findings on climate change at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History on Monday, April 22. The presentation was supplemented by the announcement of their newly published book, ""The Global Climate Crisis: What To Do About It,""ù which comprises all of the most recent scientific data on climate change ""î translated into a more digestible format for anyone to understand.† In their presentation, Smith and Fletcher touched on the main takeaways from their book by posing the current problems: global warming is irreversible and global cooperation among government institutions is hard to achieve in the face of misinformation. To address these issues, Fletcher presented a series of climate models related to global average temperature increase and sea level rise and compared natural versus anthropogenic climate change. Smith followed this by listing many alarming consequences of global warming, focusing on the rise of heat waves, forest fires, droughts and ecosystem collapse. These points highlight the severity of climate change, urging the audience to take action. ""What's going to be the most severe and will happen the soonest is going to affect the poorer nations,""ù the coauthors said, as they recited the main takeaways from their book. ""Legislation is not enough. It's also a human rights issue.""ù The authors outlined a plan to prevent further consequences of climate change with an eight-step call to action: improve efficiency and conservation, produce all electricity with renewables, use electricity for most power and heat, transition to electric vehicles, use hydrogen and synthetic fuels where needed, stop deforestation and plant billions of trees, change agriculture and implement a smooth transition from fossil fuels to reliable renewables. Unlike other books addressing climate change, the coauthors' goal was to cover a comprehensive overview of the problem by ""understanding the big issue,""ù Fletcher said. ""Not the narrow issue but the whole thing end-to-end.""ù Smith and Fletcher aimed to communicate the science without oversimplifying it to address exactly what needs to be done to reach net zero emissions ""î defined in their presentation as ""when no additional human-caused greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere.""ù When Fletcher first began exploring his interests in solving the climate crisis, his combined passions in mechanical engineering and public policy invoked him to consider the latency of government action as the main concern for addressing climate change. As a former engineer, Fletcher's experience in automation and nuclear power made it evident to him that technological solutions already existed, but an effective implementation plan kept progress stagnant. ""I started to think of global warming as an organizational issue, not a technical issue,""ù Fletcher said. ""We are proceeding without a plan.""ù† He compared institutional progress with his own analogy: ""It's like saying, ""òLet's build 500,000 charging vehicles without building a power grid!'""ù Around the same time that Fletcher was contemplating these issues, Smith, a former electrical engineer, had written several books about energy efficiency and management. Although the two authors began on separate paths, they eventually met at a local event and bonded over their common interest in nuclear energy.† Through Smith's enthusiasm for writing, he proposed that he and Fletcher translate the hard scientific evidence into accessible knowledge for the general public. The result of Smith's proposal was the first edition of their book in April 2020, ""Reaching Net Zero: What It Takes to Solve the Global Climate Crisis.""ù During this time, they witnessed an initial drop in global greenhouse gas emissions at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the return of polluted skies as case rates subsided.† After three years of continued global warming, Fletcher and Smith both agreed to write the second edition of their book to address the lack of climate solution implementation in the face of rapid change. ""By the time [the first edition] came out, it was already outdated!""ù Fletcher said. ""People don't realize things are changing, and they're changing rapidly, and that's the scary thought!""ù†† Steven Gaines ""î the dean of UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management (who co-sponsored the panel along with the Community Environmental Council) ""î attended the presentation and commended the importance of Smith and Fletcher's work. †""One of the challenges of climate change is that science is complicated. That leaves it open to people that want to befuddle the issues and make it seem like it's not real or that it's caused by something else,""ù Gaines said. ""Making the science accessible is incredibly valuable. I thought they did a really good job with this, and I imagine the book is going to do that too.""ù† Smith and Fletcher hope that their book will motivate policymakers to assess climate change from a technical standpoint and spur government action. They will continue to monitor, compile and report the latest scientific information on their website biannually. The recording of their Earth Day presentation will also be posted in the coming weeks.† Smith and Fletcher emphasized that ""failure is an option""ù and choosing to ignore the problem is only feasible for the privileged. ""There's absolutely no guarantee that the world will ever reach net zero,""ù Fletcher said. ""[However,] Craig and I are optimists. We think that we can do something about this problem ""¶ We're just not moving fast enough.""ù† ""The small steps, no matter how commendable they are, aren't going to make enough of a difference,""ù Fletcher said. In order to encourage large-scale change, they advise people to educate themselves, spread the word, lobby state and federal representatives and take wise action in reducing individual greenhouse gas emissions.†

science,NYU professor proposes solutions for sustainable agriculture at Bren Hall,9-May-24,9:00 AM,['Kevin Zhang'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-09/nyu-professor-proposes-solutions-for-sustainable-agriculture-at-bren-hall/,"On April 29 Sonali McDermid, Associate Professor of Environmental Studies at New York University, presented at UC Santa Barbara's Bren Hall to share her expertise on sustainable methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the agriculture industry. Her long term research on Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project attempts to tackle climate change in biological and socioeconomic contexts. Ever since the start of the 21st century, climate change has been a widely discussed topic around the globe. The infamous phrase ""greenhouse gasses""ù continues to become common knowledge and increases anxiety about the future of our planet. Greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide radiate heat within the earth's atmosphere by absorbing energy from the sun. This disrupts our planet's natural temperature cycle as greenhouse gasses can release heat even at night when temperatures are supposed to be cool. However, there appears to be a systematic approach that could salvage the Earth from the damage done in the past.† One of the major contributors of climate change is unsustainable agriculture. Firstly, converting pre-existing ecosystems into farmable land disrupts biogeochemical processes such as the carbon cycle. When existing vegetation is cleared for farming, carbon stored within the soil is released into the atmosphere, increasing the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Furthermore, large amounts of greenhouse gasses like methane and nitrous oxide are released into the atmosphere through intensive livestock farming and the use of fertilizers. As these harmful practices are perpetuated across the world, they create more extreme climate conditions, in turn making agriculture even more difficult.† To end this vicious cycle, McDermid and her team focus on adaptive solutions to deal with extreme weather events (such as drought or wildfires) and enabling the compensating responses of crops. Compensating responses refer to the mechanisms that plants use to change their morphology or maintain homeostasis under stressful conditions. This approach is especially effective when multiple extreme climate events overlap with each other. For example, plant stomata typically stay closed during drought to preserve water. However, when drought is combined with extreme heat, some plants actually reopen their stomata to regulate their internal temperature via transpiration and increased gas exchange. McDermid suggests that modern agriculture overemphasizes increasing crop yield rather than increasing climate resilience or tolerance of the crops.† In order to test their hypothesis, McDermid applied this innovative framework in rice fields across Bangladesh, Vietnam and India. These locations all record extremely low crop yields during drought or monsoon seasons. Observation and measurements of plant morphological features were recorded periodically and compared with other crops in similar climatic conditions. Different rice fields received different experimental treatments with some serving as the control variable. At the end of the study, three methods of increasing crop resilience appeared most appealing. The first method is crop switching, which involves building tolerance through repeated exposure. Upon maturation, plants would be exposed to incrementally increasing doses of stressors such as UV radiation or aversive chemicals. Such an approach has already seen success in some sorghum and millet species.† The second method is crop improvement through genetic modifications. DNA base pairs can be inserted or deleted in crop species in order to alter their characteristics and ultimately improve resistance. As the likes of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology become more accessible, this approach could play a significant role in altering agricultural practices. CRISPR allows scientists to select favorable genes and discard unfavorable traits in plants via DNA insertion. The final approach is crop diversification. Planting a wider variety of crops in a single season can limit the damage of unexpected weather extremes. Crop rotations can also be utilized to avoid unfavorable conditions.† ""Our focus is bolstering the strength of crops rather than avoiding the inevitable,""ù said McDermid.† Like with any good plan, there are bound to be some drawbacks. Firstly, alternative crops can be difficult to advertise to consumers who may be wary about consuming genetically modified products. Altering the resistance of plants may also disrupt its natural physiological functions, sometimes making maturation difficult even in normal conditions. Additionally, massive production quotas must be met to satisfy consumers, and diversification of crops creates a logistical difficulty. Fortunately, there are many incentives for farmers to reduce the cost of sustainable farming through government subsidized programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program which reimburses farmers for moving agricultural production away from areas susceptible to natural disasters.† McDermid stated that she is excited to continue expanding this project across Southeast Asia and will be closely in touch with policy makers, ensuring effective measures are implemented as soon as possible.†

science,"UCSB doctoral student named Schmidt Science Fellow, aims to advance pollution monitoring",9-May-24,9:00 AM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-09/ucsb-doctoral-student-named-schmidt-science-fellow-aims-to-advance-pollution-monitoring/,"CAROLYN LI / DAILY NEXUS UC Santa Barbara doctoral student Satish Kumar was one of 32 early-career scientists from 17 nationalities to be recently chosen as a 2024 Schmidt Science Fellow, a prestigious postdoctoral program. Nominated by UCSB, Kumar was the first student in the UCSB College of Engineering to be chosen for this opportunity. The Schmidt Science Fellows program hand-picks promising scientists from nearly 100 institutions around the world, emphasizing interdisciplinary research. Intertwining the scientific disciplines of engineering and environmental science, Kumar researches computer vision and machine learning, while breaking new ground in mitigating global pollution.† During his time in the Vision Research Lab at UCSB, Kumar has focused on computer vision and machine learning algorithms. The work involves imagery, whether it be phone screen images, microscopic images or biomedical images such as CT scans and X-rays. Kumar brings his expertise on computer vision to focus specifically on aerial and satellite imagery for mapping pollutants.† Kumar and his team at the Vision Research Lab developed MethaneMapper, an AI-based tool that incorporates hyperspectral imaging, a technique that utilizes information from the entire electromagnetic spectrum of light, rather than just the visible spectrum involving colors visible to the naked eye. This form of imaging allows the tool to detect specific gases, such as atmospheric methane, that would not otherwise be recognized. With the potential to revolutionize pollution monitoring, this tool could be important in helping mitigate emissions.† In the same realm of research, Kumar recently launched a company called EyeClimate in September 2023. Their mission is to create efficient solutions for pollution monitoring. ""We are focusing on developing and enhancing more solutions for methane emission detection,""ù Kumar said about EyeClimate. ""It could be from aerial imagery with satellites to airplane based imagery to someone flying in a plane or helicopter with a specific type of camera.""ù In collaboration with the Smithsonian Institute, Kumar also contributed to the development of a conservation solution that tracks animal diversity using aerial imagery. Termed WildlifeMapper, this tool was used in the Maasai Mara ecosystem in Narok County, Kenya to conduct aerial surveys of large wildlife. This would allow researchers to automatically locate and count wildlife and therefore monitor biodiversity in the area. Despite these advancements, Kumar acknowledges that pollution and biodiversity monitoring can be expensive and inaccessible to many countries who do not have the resources to focus on conservation efforts. ""Environmental conservation efforts, for example pollution monitoring, are only possible if you have a very specific half a million dollar camera either sitting on a satellite or an airplane,""ù Kumar said. ""So that's a huge bottleneck.""ù As a Schmidt Science Fellow, Kumar plans to continue his research in environmental conservation, this time focusing on using plants as bioindicators of certain pollutants. With this research, Kumar hopes to make pollution monitoring more easily accessible. ""Mosses and lichens ""î based on what kind of pollutant is present around them and in how much concentration ""î change morphology or pigment in a particular way,""ù Kumar said. Kumar seeks to use these characteristics as bioindicators, allowing him to map the pollutants in the area. As a fellow, he will be collaborating with other pioneering researchers to realize this project. Reflecting on being chosen for this opportunity, Kumar expressed his commitment to research and innovation that serves a greater purpose. ""My goal is to do good quality research and make sure it's impactful,""ù Kumar said.

science,"‚""What if We Get it Right?‚""ù: Author Ayana Elizabeth Johnson urges audience to consider the possibility of creating a climate-friendly future",16-May-24,9:00 AM,['Olivia Lohrer'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-16/what-if-we-get-it-right-author-ayana-elizabeth-johnson-urges-audience-to-consider-the-possibility-of-creating-a-climate-friendly-future/,"On May 7, UC Santa Barbara Arts & Lectures hosted marine biologist, policy expert and author Ayana Elizabeth Johnson in Campbell Hall. Johnson was included in Arts & Lectures' year-long Earth, Air, Fire, Water speaker series, highlighting notable voices in environmentalism and the earth sciences.† The event was moderated by Corley Kenna, head of communication and policy at Patagonia.† The conversation began with an account of Johnson's first love: the ocean. The ""Brooklyn native""ù described how, when she was 5, her parents took her to Key West, Florida because ""they decided it was time for [her] to learn how to swim.""ù ""The moment that literally changed my life was going on a glass-bottom boat and seeing a coral reef for the first time,""ù she said. ""That was basically the moment when I decided to become a marine biologist.""ù† This early experience and her ""stubborn""ù fascination with underwater ecosystems also prompted her later shift from science to environmental policy.† ""In that same spot where I learned to swim, the waters off the coast of Florida broke 101 degrees last summer. That is literally a hot tub,""ù she said.† Johnson explained that, not only is the ocean warming at alarming rates, but it's also becoming much more acidic than many marine species are evolutionarily capable of handling. This is because the ocean has absorbed a significant amount of carbon dioxide emissions released by human activity, significantly changing the chemical composition of the ocean. In doing so, Johnson stated that the ocean ""has really buffered the impacts of climate change.""ù ""The Earth would be unlivable for humans if it weren't for that,""ù Johnson said. ""So, first of all, thank you to the ocean for saving us from ourselves. But there's only so much it can do.""ù Despite having a career that requires her to digest disconcerting information on a daily basis, Johnson prefers to focus on all the possibilities for a better future. Her newest book ""What if We Get it Right? Visions of Climate Futures,""ù will be released on Sept. 17. A multiformat anthology, the book explores what humanity's future would look like if we employed all the solutions that we have at our fingertips.† She began by polling the audience through a show of hands: ""How many of you have seen a movie or TV show that really focuses on climate solutions?""ù She received few responses. She then asked, ""How many of you have seen a movie or TV show focused on climate problems and apocalypse and how it's all going to hell?""ù and a far greater number of audience hands went up.† ""So where do we go from there?""ù she asked. ""Believe me when I tell you there are so many solutions and there are so many incredible people out there making the change ""¶ and if we're not hearing those stories of success or, as I like to call it, possibility ""î there are infinite possible futures, and we each get to participate in shaping which one we're going to have ""î and if we don't have the literature, the media, the pop culture, if Hollywood doesn't get its act together and help us see the future, it's sort of maladaptive evolutionarily to sort of run toward a void.""ù Referring back to her inspiration for the book, she said, ""I thought that maybe I can help paint a little bit of a picture so that it doesn't seem so scary to charge ahead.""ù† She described the creative process she underwent in compiling this new and novel addition to the climate cannon. She admitted that, initially, she struggled to answer the namesake question herself.† ""I had a book deal, and I just sat on it for two years because who the hell am I to answer this question?""ù Johnson said. ""It's the biggest question I could think of and I thought it made a catchy title, but how could I do it justice?""ù† Eventually, she stopped trying to answer the question and instead began asking the question, which is her ""preferred seat to be in.""ù Prior to drafting, Johnson sought to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what a future full of climate solutions could look like by moderating discussions between people with diverging perspectives. She gave examples of conversations between fishermen and marine farmers, landscape architects and design justice pioneers or an author of the Green New Deal and a climate scientist.† ""My editor was like, ""òThis is the book. Help us figure out who we should be listening to and then help us figure out what the hell they're saying,'""ù she said. ""I realized the book could literally be transcribed interviews, essays by me, essays by my coauthors ""¶ some poetry and some original art because I feel like the only way to answer that question is with collective wisdom.""ù Johnson explained why she chooses to emphasize the ""we""ù in climate solutions, saying that it goes back to the values instilled in her as a child. Her parents only had one open-ended expectation of her: ""the one thing that they told me I needed to do when I grew up was to give back.""ù Johnson also discussed the question she gets most frequently as a prominent climate advocate: ""What can I be doing to help?""ù And to this question, she had two answers.† First of all, she highlighted the importance of voting, particularly in this upcoming election year and especially in local elections, where ""the rubber hits the road on implementing climate policy.""ù Additionally, she said, ""When I think about what people can do, my first question is ""òI don't know, what are you good at?' Maybe do that in service of advancing climate solutions.""ù In assisting people on how they can answer this question, she referenced the three-circle Venn diagram framework that she offers in her ""How to Find Joy in Climate Action""ù TedTalk.† ""The first [circle] is ""òwhat are you good at?' What are your skills, resources and networks? What do you bring to the table? And think about that very generously, we all have a lot to offer.""ù ""The second circle is ""òwhat is the work that needs doing?' What are the climate and justice solutions that you want to focus on? Because there are literally hundreds of things ""¶ and we can't do them all so pick one, pick two, pick a few.""ù ""And the third [circle] is ""òwhat brings you joy?' What gets you out of bed in the morning? ""¶ What brings you satisfaction? Or what's gratifying? Or what's rewarding enough that you keep going?""ù At the intersection of these three questions, Johnson believes that everybody can find their specific contribution to the solutions that we need. †""I personally love this framework because it really is a chance for each of us to leverage our superpowers, and that's really what we need.""ù

science,Diversifying the outdoors with wildlife biologist Rae Wynn-Grant,16-May-24,9:00 AM,['Lauryn Cummins'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-16/diversifying-the-outdoors-with-wildlife-biologist-rae-wynn-grant/,"Four-time Emmy-nominated ecologist, television personality, author and Bren School of Environmental Science and Management researcher Rae Wynn-Grant spoke at the Pacific View Room at UC Santa Barbara on April 23. There, she divulged her journey of becoming a renowned researcher and advocate for diversity within the environmental education sphere. Wynn-Grant emphasized the need for more minority representation in science, as a Black woman who grew up without seeing her reflection in her mentors and her field as a whole. Her recently published book, ""Wild Life: Finding My Purpose in an Untamed World,""ù discusses her journey following her childhood dreams to become a wildlife ecologist. Although she grew up in the urban jungle of Cincinnati, Ohio, Wynn-Grant had a fascination with nature from a young age. Early on, she knew she wanted to hold a job similar to the white male explorers on popularized nature television shows. Wynn-Grant reflected on the lack of diversity in the natural spaces she observed on television as a child. ""It was those shows that showed me wild animals and the people who work with them because I had no idea that there were jobs or careers in wildlife ecology,""ù Wynn-Grant said. ""So all those British and Australian middle-aged white guys were absolutely my heroes and still are, many of them. But they were so different.""ù† Despite the boundaries set by the lack of representation, she continued to pursue her passion for environmental science in her young adulthood. Unsure what to major in at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, she decided to try to pursue environmental science in the hopes that it would give her insight into becoming a nature host. ""In that department, I kind of realized, you know what, there's more to this nature show host thing, you know. It's cool to be on TV and to, you know, be able to communicate that science, but this is a mission-critical field,""ù Wynn-Grant said. ""I learned there's a lot of environmental challenges going on and these people can train me to be a solution maker.""ù During an immersive study abroad program in rural Kenya, Wynn-Grant received news of Hurricane Katrina and the mismanagement of the natural disaster that led to the deaths of many people of color. The news led her to the realization that social justice was something she needed to fight for, regardless of where she was in the world or the work she was doing. ""I'm always going to have to do both and infuse both of these things together: ecology and wildlife conservation with social justice and empowerment of communities that are facing marginalization,""ù Wynn-Grant said. While abroad in Kenya, Wynn-Grant witnessed instances of young poachers being arrested for the illegal hunting of giraffes. After their arrests, Wynn-Grant described watching Indigenous women of the Maasai tribe come to collect the giraffe meat for food. Watching this unfold, she realized that the issue at hand was how the lack of resources in Black communities contributes to wildlife crimes. Wynn-Grant walked the audience through the socioeconomic complexity of poaching, sharing her initial ignorance of the ""highly racialized economic inequality across Africa, where one person's life can be snuffed out.""ù Expanding her point, she revealed, ""my science background had trained me to only see the wildlife problem and stay blind to the needs of nearby villages.""ù This experience, which she described as a ""whiplash moment,""ù helped Wynn-Grant merge her scientific work with social studies, giving her an interdisciplinary perspective as a wildlife ecologist.† Throughout her career, Wynn-Grant was determined to diversify fields in which she often did not see her own reflection. At a previous office job, many of her coworkers turned a blind eye to a march for Black lives when they had been supportive of a previously held Women's March. She decided to take a stance. ""I remember standing up in a staff meeting and saying, ""òOkay, here's what's going to change,'""ù Wynn-Grant recalled. """"òIf we as a community support science ""¶ that means we have to support scientists, and scientists are women, black, brown, any kind of racial group, from the LGBTQ+ community and immigrants because we are all intersectional people that come from different places. You don't just get to support science in a vacuum.'""ù Highlighting people of color has been a recent theme in her work, including one of her major projects, a podcast called ""Going Wild""ù with the Public Broadcasting Service. It features an array of accomplished BIPOC wildlife ecologists and shares their most interesting stories about their experiences working in the field.† ""In seasons 2 and 3 the entirety of guests featured were BIPOC,""ù she stated. In addition to this, Wynn-Grant stressed the need to allocate more resources to engage low-income communities in the field of science, especially in the face of a warming climate and socio-economic change.† Wynn-Grant continues to advocate for diversity in science and the exposure of low-income communities to research and mental health resources. Reflecting on her experiences in the scientific community, Wynn-Grant acknowledges that there has been a positive shift in the conversation.† ""I talked about painful moments that have come up in my life and in my career, but there's also a lot of emerging discussions that are happening and that are healing,""ù Wynn-Grant said.

science,Making sure it‚'s Correkt: a group of UCSB students set out to revolutionize the ethics of AI chatbots,16-May-24,9:00 AM,['Na Huang'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-16/making-sure-its-correkt-a-group-of-ucsb-students-set-out-to-revolutionize-the-ethics-of-ai-chatbots/,"When second-year computer science major Alexzendor Misra first came to UC Santa Barbara in Fall Quarter 2022, he had no idea an ill-fated encounter with a conspiracy-believing peer would inspire the creation of an artificial intelligence search engine, Correkt.† Merely two months into college, Misra began a project that he hopes can truly change the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.† Now, Misra and his team, consisting of first-year statistics and data science major Andre Braga, first-year computer science major Ryan Hung, first-year statistics and data science major Chan Park, first-year computer engineering major Khilan Surapaneni and second-year computer science majors Noah Wang and Ramon Wang, are ready to showcase the outcome of their project. They are preparing themselves to present their product, Correkt, an AI search engine, to the UCSB community at the AI Community of Practice (CoP) Spring Symposium on May 20.† Correkt is not so different from ChatGPT ""î in fact, what ChatGPT does, Correkt can do too. Yet, Correkt aims to solve one critical issue with ChatGPT: misinformation.† It is known that ChatGPT is prone to ""hallucinations,""ù and according to IBM, it refers to the generation of false information due to the AI software's misinterpretation of patterns or objects. Correkt is designed to prevent these instances of misinformation dissemination in two ways.† Correkt is linked solely to reputable data sources ""î newspapers, textbooks and peer-reviewed journals. The AI model currently draws its information from an expansive data bank of over 180 million well-established, trustworthy resources ""î a number set to grow with time. This greatly lowers the risk of receiving inaccurate information by eliminating unreliable sources. However, it still does not give users the freedom to verify the information they access. This is where Correkt truly sets itself apart from pre-existing AI chatbots: it includes a built-in citation function that details the precise location where every piece of information it presents to the user was retrieved. Essentially, Correkt is a hybrid between a search engine and an AI chatbot. The citation function allows users to judge for themselves the accuracy and validity of the information they receive as they would when conducting research through a search engine. The difference would be that the results will be much more streamlined with the support of AI.† ""[Correkt] has so much more value as a way to find information, like a new generation of [a] search engine,""ù Misra comments enthusiastically.† Looking back, Misra recalls how the initial idea of building a fact-checking software had come to him in November 2022.† During his first year, Misra was shocked to discover that one of his peers' worldview was deeply impacted by the many inaccurate conspiracy theories they believed in. After much contemplation, Misra identified the power of misinformation to lead people to become brainwashed in such a way.† ""That sort of misinformation, that sort of brainwashing happens when sources of information that you consider trustworthy become polluted,""ù he shares. Examining the immense impact of AI chatbots only two years after their release, Misra foresees that it will only be a matter of time until AI becomes a main source of information for people. Paired with the hallucinating nature of AI chatbots, this could lead to a particularly dangerous era of information misalignment. Hence, when an opportunity unveiled itself at the club Data Science UCSB to pitch an innovative project for a club-wide competition, Misra did not hesitate to gather a group of like-minded individuals to find a potential solution to the problem of AI misinformation. Though he had initially incentivized his teammates to pursue the project with the competition and a good mark on a resume, he was delighted to discover that his team unanimously supported his ambition of continuing the project beyond Data Science UCSB's activities.† By the time the competition ended in the Spring Quarter 2023, the team had completed basic information software that they excitedly presented to those around them. Although the project had not started out intending to create a product for the average person to use, Misra's team was quick to recognize its potential to be of help to the general public.† With this in mind, over the summer, the team of engineers began reaching out to more potential users to test their software, which led them to focus on creating a fact-checking AI catered to the needs of college students.† The past year for Misra and his team has been one of discovery and dedication. As young college students who are still in the process of gaining the knowledge and the experience required to accomplish a great feat, they took it upon themselves to seek out mentors and learning opportunities along the way.† Their hard work paid off when they launched their website, Correkt.ai, on April 25 and received positive feedback from close family and friends. The success of their startup can also be observed from the 5,000 users they have been able to reach organically within this short time.† The group has now entered a new phase of their project; their attention is directed towards marketing and promoting Correkt.ai, and the upcoming AI CoP Spring Symposium could be helpful with this. The engineers behind Correkt will present their project at 3 p.m. on May 20 at an online panel that all UCSB students and faculty are able to register for. They are hoping to grow their users and attract potential investors with this presentation.† Finally, Misra and his teammates emphasize their goal of adapting AI to advocate for more ethical usage of information. ""Transparency is the number one priority for AI ethics and credibility,""ù says Park, one of the engineers who has worked alongside Misra since Fall Quarter 2023.† The Pandora's box to an era of AI information has been opened, and projects like ""Correkt""ù give hope that this complex balance between technological advancement and ethics can be navigated.†

science,UCSB hosts collegiate California Workshop on Evolutionary Social Science,23-May-24,9:00 AM,['Isabelle Kang'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-23/ucsb-hosts-collegiate-california-workshop-on-evolutionary-social-science/,"UC Santa Barbara hosted the annual California Workshop on Evolutionary Social Science for the first time since 2018 from May 3-5.† Founded in 2000, the California Workshop on Evolutionary Social Science (C-WESS) began as a social science research meeting between students and faculty at UC Santa Barbara and UC Los Angeles. In 2006, this convention grew to include UC Davis and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, eventually expanding to Cal State Fullerton, Chapman University, Stanford University, Loyola Marymount, Arizona State University and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Today, C-WESS brings together multiple universities as a student-led conference that features undergraduate and graduate research presentations in the social sciences. Research topics revolve around the examination of human behavior through an evolutionary perspective, encompassing topics such as sociology, psychology, anthropology and geography.† The hosting campus for the annual convention is determined by a general rotation around the participating universities. This year, C-WESS was held at the UCSB West Conference Center, located on Santa Rosa Avenue. Hannah Frogge and Joseph Kilgallen, anthropological science graduate students at UCSB, were the main organizers for the 2024 convention. Frogge expressed looking forward to hosting the event.† ""Especially since we're in the middle of the state, it's a good place to hold the conference,""ù explained Frogge. ""Everyone was excited for it to be at UCSB, and it happened to be our turn to host.""ù C-WESS was established with the goals of collaboration, knowledge exchange and most importantly, accessibility. Participation is free of charge, along with meals, lodging and travel fares.† ""Something particularly special about C-WESS is that a lot of academic conferences are difficult to access,""ù expressed Kilgallen. Either membership fees are expensive, or travel is expensive, or you have to register for a conference. All of these costs stack up, so a really cool thing about C-WESS is that it was formed with the idea of making it accessible to everyone. It's free for all students to attend, undergrad and graduate.""ù† Camping is a long-standing tradition for C-WESS that not only serves as a fun way to destress and meet other participants, but it also helps waive living costs. Campers enjoyed an opening bonfire Friday night, along with catering and casual conversation. This year, C-WESS participants camped at Cachuma Lake Campgrounds in Santa Ynez Valley, located 30 minutes northwest of UCSB.† According to Frogge and Kilgallen, the event was a success, with a turnout of approximately 70 participants. The convention's events consisted of a poster session, in which undergraduates presented their research posters comfortably in low-pressure settings and 15-20 speaker sessions that allowed graduates and professors to present their individual research subjects. These speaker sessions were followed by small breakout groups for participants to engage with professors and graduates and ask questions about their research, graduate school and overlapping interests.† Keynote speaker Dr. Annie Wertz, a new hire at UCSB, presented her research on how plants contribute to social learning and cognitive development in children through an evolutionary perspective.† ""We focused on trying to find an exciting keynote that we thought could speak across different interests,""ù Kilgallen responded, when asked how Wertz was chosen to be the keynote speaker. ""The evolutionary social sciences pulls in a lot of anthropologists, as well as psychologists, and we wanted someone who would have wide appeal and was doing new and exciting research. So we were lucky and super happy to have Dr. Wertz speak for us.""ù Across the board, Frogge and Kilgallen received positive feedback for the convention, which is one of the reasons why C-WESS 2025 is tentatively set at UCSB for the second year in a row.† ""We did too well,""ù joked Kilgallen. ""That was our mistake.""ù† Although retiring as lead organizers, Frogge and Kilgallen have high hopes as for what C-WESS will look like next year ""î some of its main improvements being in funding and undergraduate involvement. ""A thing about C-WESS is that we pull money from different departments across the UC and other participating campuses,""ù explained Frogge. ""Because C-WESS is a longer-standing conference and evolutionary social sciences are so deeply rooted in California, we are hoping to ask for further support and involvement from people at the higher levels, such as the dean, in the future.""ù Kilgallen echoed a similar sentiment, and recalled the principles of C-WESS: to be accessible and welcoming of social science research at all collegiate levels.† ""The founding values of C-WESS stand, and we don't want to change that by any means,""ù stated Kilgallen. ""Especially coming out of Covid, it's been hard organizing people, so our goals moving forward may be to continue to build the conference, and the people that it reaches. This year was successful pulling in undergrads, which is something we hope to do more of in the future.""ù The success of C-WESS 2024 at UC Santa Barbara has set the tone for the growth of future conferences, including the following convention being tentatively scheduled at UCSB in the spring. As C-WESS continues to expand its breadth in students and funding, it remains steadfast to its fundamental pillars of accessibility, undergrad and graduate involvement and student-faculty collaboration.†

science,Maykonome: Conservationist and photographer Cristina Mittermeier speaks on ocean protection efforts,23-May-24,9:00 AM,['Natalie LeFevre'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-23/maykonome-conservationist-and-photographer-cristina-mittermeier-speaks-on-ocean-protection-efforts/,"""Ikigai""ù: the Japanese word for the purpose of one's life. To National Geographic photographer and SeaLegacy founder Cristina Mittermeier, this is the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what makes money and what the world needs. On Friday, May 10, Mittermeier spoke as part of UC Santa Barbara's Arts and Lectures ""Earth, Air, Fire, Water""ù series, sharing with audiences her experiences as a photographer and how they led to her life-long dedication to ocean conservation ""î her ikigai. Ocean and environmental conversation is a pressing topic for today's generation. Issues like climate change and rising sea levels have become part of daily conversations, and conservationists like Mittermeier are seeking to address them. Mittermeier started her journey with what she calls a ""traditional Mexican woman's upbringing""ù in Mexico City. She came from a family with little interest in the environment, but found herself fascinated with the ocean from a young age.† This fascination stayed with her, and Mittermeier went on to study at the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey in Mexico, gaining a degree in biochemical engineering in marine sciences. Although she had gone to school intending to learn more about how to protect the ocean, she later realized that she was actually learning ""everything you need to know about how to extract enormous amounts of biomass from the ocean.""ù Mittermeier quickly realized this was not what she wanted to pursue, but she knew she had a desire to be involved in ocean conservation. Despite her scientific background, she decided to approach the issue through storytelling. Not knowing where to start, she settled on borrowing a camera and began shooting. She attended Corcoran School of the Arts & Design's fine art photography program, where she honed her skills. Over the course of her career, she has traveled to 133 countries as a photographer on assignment and her work has been featured in National Geographic, TIME Magazine, CNN and many other publications. Mittermeier's goal is to build awareness of people's responsibility to the environment, and our duty to protect it. Mittermeier is adamant about the importance of storytelling in enacting change, particularly in ocean and environmental conservation. According to Mittermeier, ""without stories, the ocean dies in silence,""ù arguing that ""the right story can change everything.""ù Telling the right story is just what Mittermeier has set out to do throughout her career. She described her first assignment photographing Indigenous peoples in Brazil who were going to be displaced due to the construction of the world's fourth largest hydroelectric power plant, the Belo Monte Dam. Mittermeier hoped that her photographs would bring attention to these peoples, and perhaps halt the dam's construction. Mittermeier was unsuccessful and the dam was constructed. However, she said her job was ""to tell the story of the mothers, the children, the families that were going to lose their homes.""ù Mittermeier did exactly that, detailing the peoples' connection to the Amazon. She described their tattoos made from semi-permanent ink, derived from the genipap fruit, which indicates their marital status, household and much more. Every two weeks this has to be reapplied, with children sitting for hours as their mothers paint them. Mittermeier even described the people's desires to paint her, and her struggles in communicating with them about it. According to Mittermeier, it was incredibly difficult to speak with the Indigenous people, even with a translator. But one term she did pick up was ""maykonome,""ù a common greeting meaning ""I see you.""ù Mittemeier emphasized the significance of the word's meaning, explaining that ""your life depends on being seen by the rest of the community, on being accountable""ù. It is this ideology and ingenuity of Indigenous peoples that Mittermeier believes we need to learn from in order to address current environmental and oceanic issues. She wishes to implement their techniques and approaches to problem solving for conservation. Despite being highly successful and sought after, Mittermeier decided to leave her position as a professional photographer for National Geographic at the height of her career and founded the nonprofit SeaLegacy. SeaLegacy's mission is to ""inspire people to fall in love with the ocean, amplify a network of changemakers around the world, and catalyze hands-on diplomacy through hopeful, world-class visual storytelling.""ù SeaLegacy aims to tell stories in the hopes of† saving the ocean and help the world meet the seven recovery wedges that comprise the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These recovery wedges are steps meant to restore the ocean's health and ocean wildlife. They include protecting more of the ocean, preserving biodiversity, restoring degraded habitats, stemming the flow of ocean pollution, rethinking how food from the ocean is sourced, viewing the ocean as a solution to climate change and achieving ocean equity and justice for coastal communities. Mittermeier believes that following these wedges would allow marine life to rebuild in a single generation. However, she says we have to do so ourselves, because ""No one is coming to save us.""ù To realize this, Mittermeier has been raising funds and working to protect the environment. For example, when the Canadian government refused to protect a subspecies of gray wolves specific to British Columbia from hunting, Mittermeir and a group of photographers took matters into their own hands. To protect them from being hunted, the group raised funds and bought all of the hunting licenses for these wolves. Mittermeier emphasizes the importance of not only the work by conservationists and nonprofit organizations, but also efforts at an individual level. She describes Americans as ""the most philanthropic people on planet Earth,""ù donating 480 billion dollars per year on average. Yet of this, only 1.8% goes to the environment, 0.25% to the ocean specifically. She urges people to donate more towards the environment, stating that ""our lives depend on it.""ù Mittermeier also described her newest crowdfunded project, ""Hope""ù, a book featuring a collection of her work throughout her career. Proceeds will be donated to the communities photographed within the book.† ""Hope is a choice ""¶ the minute we lose the hope we have lost the fight,""ù Mittermeier said. To close, Mittermeier emulated the beginning of her talk, and the accountability we owe each other. Mittermeier urged the audience to say, ""I am accountable to you, I'm going to do everything in my power to keep our planet alive.""ù As, according to Mittermeier, ""That's what I'm doing the rest of my life ""¶ maykonome to all of you.""ù

science,Best of Scientific Breakthroughs,30-May-24,9:00 AM,"['Nandini Kuppa', 'Kaitlin Lee', 'Katharine Chi', 'Olivia Lohrer']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-30/best-of-scientific-breakthroughs/,"A look back on notable scientific achievements from UCSB researchers during the 2023-2024 year. † UCSB Professor earns early technical achievement award By: Nandini Kuppa MICHELLE WU / DAILY NEXUS In the rapidly advancing field of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI), the struggle to balance the accuracy and ability of machine linguistics has come to a head. With AI often missing the mark on replicating verbal and written human interpretations of the world, William Wang, a professor in the Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara and director of UCSB's Center for Responsible Machine Learning, took on the responsibility of developing the necessary scalable algorithms to pose a solution.† His work earned him the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Signal Processing Society's Pierre-Simon Laplace Early Career Technical Achievement Award in April 2024, which he accepted in Seoul, South Korea.† Wang primarily focused on problems in structured learning, where multiple outputs could be created by a single data input, and continues to use logic programs to enhance this critical process in the realm of AI. Although achieving the balance between accuracy and scalability continues to be an avenue for improvement, Wang's ingenuity in machine language models stands as a strong foundation for future research. † Cannibal cells for cancer therapy By: Kaitlin Lee MICHELLE WU / DAILY NEXUS UC Santa Barbara molecular, cellular and developmental biology professors Denise Montell and Meghan Morrissey made a once in a lifetime discovery when they found the cause of a rare human disease ""î a gene that they also found has the potential to be used for cancer therapy.† The gene in question is Rac2, a regulator of immune cell shape and function. Montell, a Duggan Professor and Distinguished Professor at UCSB, previously studied the Rac2 gene in fruit flies 25 years ago and found that activating the gene in just a few cells of the egg chamber destroyed the entire structure. It wasn't until this recent breakthrough that Montell found the mechanism to be cellular cannibalism: a hyperactive Rac2 causes cells to be eaten alive by other cells. Montell, Morrissey and their team showed that this hyperactivity was responsible for a human immunodeficiency disease due to the stimulation of macrophages, a type of white blood cell, to cannibalize and engulf active immune system T cells.† Morrissey had previously worked with programming macrophages to consume cancer cells, and found that adding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to the macrophages increased this activity. In this study, she and her team demonstrated that CAR macrophages were significantly more efficient at ""eating""ù cancer cells when Rac2 was hyperactive. However, active Rac2 did not increase activity of CAR macrophages when the correct receptor was not present. This is good news for clinical applications, as it provides another level of control to hopefully prevent CAR-M treatment from attacking any important immune cells, such as T cells. The discovery has potential to help find a clinical treatment that can successfully target different types of cancers. † Cargo ship speed tracking program to mitigate whale mortality By: Katharine Chi MICHELLE WU / DAILY NEXUS UC Santa Barbara students have created a vessel tracking tool which tracks the near real-time movement of cargo ships and North Atlantic right whales going up and down the North American East Coast. The vessel analytic tool is a pivotal part of the Whale Safe program that was developed by the UCSB Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory. Whale Safe merges whale tracking, blue whale habitat modeling and reports from citizen scientists in the Santa Barbara channel, with the tools already being used to track vessels and prevent collision between the two. The mass implementation of the vessel monitoring tool and the efforts behind Whale Safe were led by UCSB associate professor and marine ecologist Douglas McCauley. Ship strikes are one of the major causes of whale killings on both the East and West Coasts of North America. By allowing resource managers, conservationists, shipping companies, retailers and the general public to see the location and speed of cargo ships as well as the traveling paths of whales, the tool helps users gain an understanding of ocean traffic and vessel speed limit zones.† The North Atlantic right whale is a highly endangered species as there are approximately only 350 left in the world, and many of them are dying due to ship strikes. This tool provides transparency and places accountability to shipping operations, which ultimately helps mitigate whale mortality rates. The data also helps scientists and researchers determine where to allocate resources. The goal is to promote awareness of the whales as they intersect with the world's busiest shipping routes during their own migrations and encourage slower vessel speeds in these zones. Since Whale Safe has been implemented in the Bay Area in 2022, there has been a decline in whale-ship collisions along the West Coast.† † Coastal monitoring app By: Olivia Lohrer MICHELLE WU / DAILY NEXUS You may have seen it if you've recently found yourself over by East Campus Beach: a small sign inviting you to scan a QR code, take a picture, and upload it to the CoastSnap app. Our campus is home to the first installation of the CoastSnap Project in Santa Barbara County.†† The CoastSnap app was developed by researchers in Australia hoping to monitor how coastlines change over time. Typically, long-term and continuous documentation can be a challenge when monitoring the complex geological and climatological processes that impact a specific place. CoastSnap, however, is revolutionizing how this qualitative data is collected through ""low-cost""ù ""citizen science,""ù where the average beach goer gets an opportunity to participate in this essential research with a tool that they are already likely to be carrying""ìtheir smartphone. East Campus Beach is an optimal location for a CoastSnap station for a couple of reasons. First of all, it is a high-traffic area that students and campus non-affiliates enjoy frequently. Furthermore, East Campus Beach is regarded as an especially ""dynamic""ù stretch of coastline. Tide fluctuations are dramatic: low-tides allow for a walk on the sandy beach, while high tides often reach the bluffs and submerge the bottom of the staircase underwater, making the beach impassable. Continual photographic data can help clue scientists in to how the tides are changing over the long-term as a result of sea level rise. Changing tide patterns also have important implications for bluff erosion, which currently poses a challenge for the university.† UC Santa Barbara marine researcher Kyle Emery is currently working on expanding CoastSnap spots along California's coastline. Additionally, he is working to establish a website that displays all the photos captured from these spots. The website would create a comprehensive visual timeline of the California coast, allowing civilians to witness firsthand how their favorite beaches are changing as a result of shifting tides, storm surges and human activity. CoastSnap is about more than just research ""ì it is a community-driven approach to engaging a wider public in environmental monitoring and alerting them to the fragility of our coasts.†

science,AAPI Faculty Highlight: UCSB professor Thuc-Quyen Nguyen‚'s path to pioneering chemistry,30-May-24,9:00 AM,"['Nandini Kuppa', 'Qien Feng']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-30/aapi-faculty-highlight-ucsb-professor-thuc-quyen-nguyens-path-to-pioneering-chemistry/,"Thuc-Quyen Nguyen, an award-winning researcher at UC Santa Barbara and Director of Center for Polymers and Organic Solids, has made significant contributions to modern organic electronic devices as a means of improving global access to electricity. By using organic compounds and manipulating the packing of molecules, Nguyen and her team progress towards a future of cost-efficient solar devices.† Not only is Nguyen a prolific pioneer in her field, but she is also making strides for AAPI women. Nguyen's nontraditional journey from her childhood in Vietnam to her college, post-graduate, and research experiences in the U.S. have come to shape her view and impact on today's world. Nguyen lived her childhood and adolescent life in the town of Buon Ma Thuot, Vietnam. Growing up, she did not have access to most basic needs, including food, water, clothing and electricity. Nguyen recalls how she and her family had to fit their daily schedules to the patterns of the sun, often going to bed and waking up early to make use of their time in the light. ""Because of that difficult life, I have a lot of creativity and motivation,""ù Nguyen said. ""I always dreamed that if I could capture the sunlight and put it into a jar then I could use the night-time to study, read books and do something.""ù Nguyen's life in Vietnam was never devoid of imagination and the opportunity to learn. In fact, she was able to discover her inherent passion for teaching at a young age; with four generations of teachers in her family, including her mother. Nguyen was readily exposed to the art of teaching. Without access to child-care, Nguyen often attended her mother's classes, and there she began to gain a better understanding of the classroom and grow keen toward it.† ""I remember one day I got bored playing with my sister and I decided to stare at the classroom and watch my mother,""ù Nguyen recalled. ""I watched the students take notes and listen so well""¶ I remember saying, ""òwow, when I grow up I want to be just like my mother.'""ù At the age of 21, Nguyen and her family moved to America, where she began her commitment to learning the culture and language of this new place. Her dedication to adapting to a new society manifested itself as she took heavy loads of classes and attended regular tutoring as a means of improving her English. ""It is terrifying as [international students] have to face culture shock""¶ I went through all of that; I understand it very well,""ù Nguyen shared. ""Still, you have to put yourself out there ""¶ to learn and adapt quickly.""ù In 1995, Nguyen graduated with her associate's degree and went on to receive her bachelor's degree in Chemistry at UCLA. It was during her time at UCLA that Nguyen had her first exposure to research. She joined a biology lab where she learned to navigate herself around the lab environment. Just like any other undergraduate students, Nguyen engaged in basic lab processes such as cleaning glassware and carrying out fundamental procedures. Nguyen treated this opportunity with much gratitude and appreciation.† ""When I came to college, I was so curious about how things work""¶I would open drawers to look at the different shapes of glassware,""ù Nguyen said. ""For students, I advise to question everything; learn about cleaning, [ask] ""òwhy is cleaning important? What happens to the reaction if there is soap in the glassware? What happens if the glassware is contaminated?'""ù After finishing her time as an undergraduate, Nguyen continued to build her passions in chemistry at UCLA, where she earned her master's and doctorate degrees in Physical Chemistry with the initial goal of getting a company job.† ""During the interview process, I realized that with my personality and my passion, I love the freedom to do things on my own and dig deep into a problem,""ù Nguyen reflected. ""It is hard to do that at a company level; I realized that I would not be happy there.""ù Nguyen continued to explore the field of chemistry and molecular electronics while doing postdoctoral work at Columbia University under the guidance of professor Louis Brus and the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. During this time, Nguyen switched her major and research groups multiple times until she affirmed her desire to pursue chemistry.†† Nguyen especially encourages students who are currently pursuing their collegiate endeavors to ""pay attention to understand the process of learning something. If you know how to do that, later when you go on to real life, you know the process of how to acquire knowledge and learn things on your own. You have to learn how to learn.""ù She believes that no matter what degrees students end up obtaining, the ability to cultivate new information in a short period of time is the most valuable. In July 2004, Nguyen was hired by UCSB to take on the role of assistant professor at the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, a culmination of her educational achievements that intertwined her disciplines in chemistry and teaching. ""I did not know whether to apply for only a teaching position or research,""ù Nguyen said with a laugh. ""So I did both.""ù† Today, she continues her role as a full-professor while maintaining her passions of chemistry both through her teaching and research group.† ""I really, really, love my job, and that is the reason why I work a lot,""ù Nguyen said. In addition to her research and teaching endeavors, Nguyen acts as an academic life-coach to more than 40 students across the globe, some of whom she has never met in person.† ""I cannot return the favor to the people who helped me, but I can pass on this to younger generations,""ù Nguyen said.† In this way, Nguyen tries to support as many students as she can by sharing her wisdom and giving guidance to students in need.† Nguyen's non-linear path toward obtaining her dream career is an example that showcases the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the field of the sciences. Above all, she advocates for a piece of advice she hopes all people can resonate with and strive towards: ""You need to learn your strengths and your weaknesses,""ù Nguyen affirmed. ""The strengths, you can use to your advantage. All of us have weaknesses, at least one. Put in the effort to plan what we can do to improve [those weaknesses].""ù† Today, Nguyen stands as evidence for the scientific community of UCSB students and scholars worldwide that having a drive and a strong goal is the key to living out one's dreams. With determination and a well-founded plan, she affirms the ability of students to achieve their personal versions of success. After all these years, Nguyen was able to fulfill her childhood dreams of capturing the sun's light within her research and now hopes to help others fulfill their own.

science,Simply Stated: Is pulling an all-nighter for an exam worth it?,11-Jun-24,8:06 PM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-06-11/simply-stated-is-pulling-an-all-nighter-for-an-exam-worth-it/,"We've all been there ""î it's the night before your 8 a.m. final and the library announces that late-night study is moving to the first and second floors. You experience a rude awakening to the sheer amount of material you have left to cram inside your brain before the morning. The question is: Do you get a good night's sleep or do you pull an all-nighter in an attempt to succeed?† Some swear by the all-nighter ritual, while others decide to call it a night and head to bed. But what does science say about the effectiveness of pulling an all-nighter to study? According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, staying awake for a prolonged period of time can lead to cognitive and physiological impairment at the level of alcohol intoxication. In other words, being awake for 24 hours can hinder thinking to the same extent as having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.10%.† For reference, it's illegal in the United States to drive with a BAC of 0.08% or higher as someone over the age of 21. As you can imagine, your brain might not be at its sharpest when taking a test under these conditions. Sleep also plays a key role in learning, memory and consolidation of information. One study investigated the effects of an all-nighter, clinically termed ""total sleep deprivation,""ù before and after learning. The data suggested that total sleep deprivation had significantly harmful effects on the memory of learned material. The researchers found that adequate sleep was associated with priming the brain for learning and strengthening memory from the day before. In addition, getting a good night's sleep is important for maintaining health. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and Sleep Research Society (SRS), the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is 7-9 hours. Sleeping less than 7 hours on a regular basis can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, depression, diabetes, stroke and other diseases, as well as an increased risk of accidents and errors. So, an all-nighter before a test might not be as effective as you would think. But if you do decide to tough out the night, there are some ways you can maximize your learning and retention of information. One is to make sure you stay hydrated and feed your brain with a balanced, healthy meal. The brain uses glucose as its main source of energy, but processed sugars in candy and soda burn out quickly, causing a crash in energy. Instead, opt for complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Caffeine can be helpful to stay focused, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend consuming more than 400 mg of caffeine per day. Caffeine is dehydrating, so accompany that Red Bull with a tall glass of water.† According to the Sleep Foundation, it can be effective to take a 10-20 minute nap to help you stay alert, but avoid snoozing, as 30 or more minutes can cause you to feel groggy. Study in a room with bright lights to keep yourself stimulated. If you feel yourself falling asleep, take a walk or do a quick physical activity to refocus your mind. All-nighters should be reserved as a desperate last resort; try to avoid them if you can! The most effective way to retain information is to give yourself ample time to learn material and space out your study sessions over a longer period of time than the night before your exam. For most college students, however, this may be easier said than done. Whether you choose to pull an all-nighter or hit the hay, Science and Tech is wishing you all the best this finals season!

science,"OPINION: My journey through topical steroid withdrawal, a failure of the medical community",13-Jul-24,4:24 PM,['Kaitlin Lee'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-07-13/opinion-my-journey-through-topical-steroid-withdrawal-a-failure-of-the-medical-community/,"MICHELLE WU / DAILY NEXUS Over the past few months, my skin developed a full-body rash characterized by cycles of red, burning, inflamed skin and relentless itching. I am struggling with a condition called topical steroid withdrawal (TSW), a diagnosis that has yet to be officially recognized by the National Health Service. This debilitating condition was caused by the very medications prescribed to me for relief ""î a result of the medical community's failure to recognize and address the long-term risks associated with topical steroid use. Growing up with eczema, a chronic skin disease that causes dry, itchy patches of skin, my symptoms were always mild. It never interfered with my day-to-day life, so I grew used to it, accepting it as just part of who I was.† It wasn't until I went to the dermatologist for the first time in my adult life that I was unknowingly prescribed the most potent steroid cream on the market. At first it worked like magic, until my skin took a turn for the worse. Topical steroids are a popular first-line method of treatment that can be incredibly beneficial for many people with eczema. However, it is important to use them correctly and safely. Overuse can lead to negative side effects such as thinning of the skin, inflamed hair follicles and acne. In more serious cases, it can cause conditions like topical steroid withdrawal and Cushing syndrome, resulting from excess cortisol and leading to symptoms such as weight gain, high blood pressure and bone loss. Topical steroid creams constrict blood vessels, reducing inflammation in the skin and treating skin diseases like eczema and psoriasis. Over time the body can become dependent on the creams and result in topical steroid addiction ""î a condition in which the skin no longer responds to the creams. In this case, dermatologists often prescribe stronger and stronger steroid creams, increasing the skin's dependency. Researchers Marvin J. Rapaport and Mark Lebwohl theorize that discontinuing steroid treatment dilates blood vessels, causing TSW, also known as Red Skin Syndrome (RSS), a term coined by Rapaport. The result is commonly a full-body rash characterized by intense burning, itching and erythroderma, or severely inflamed skin. Other common symptoms are oozing and weeping, flaking and shedding of the skin, insomnia and hair loss. Many dermatologists take topical steroid medical warnings seriously and recommend a safe plan for patients to use them in the short term. But there are far too many who overprescribe topical steroids, sometimes for years, and do not provide patients with the proper warnings. In my case, I was never given any instructions on the recommended usage and trusted that it was a harmless medicine. After all, how dangerous could a topical cream be? Little did I know that its recommended usage was for no more than two weeks. I proceeded to use it for over a year before I began hearing about TSW on social media, where many individuals suffering from the condition shared their journey online to raise awareness.† When I first learned about TSW I was shocked that such severe side effects could occur and stopped using steroid creams immediately. With TSW being relatively rare, I hadn't thought my usage could have affected me in the same way. Nevertheless, red inflammation began to spread all over my body ""î it burned in a way that I had never experienced before. When I went back to the dermatologist, they suggested more steroid creams to manage the symptoms. I knew that what I was experiencing was topical steroid withdrawal, but my concerns were dismissed and I was told that it was just a more severe case of eczema. In my distrust, I decided not to use any more topical steroids. Looking for testimonials online, I found that many others had similar experiences: dismissal from doctors, concerns going unheard and no acknowledgement of TSW being a legitimate condition. It is a disappointing experience to realize that the people who are supposed to take care of your health are failing to address such a serious condition. The medical community should be responsible for familiarizing themselves with the adverse effects of topical steroids and how to prevent and treat them, rather than leaving so many people in the dark to suffer. Scientists know very little about TSW, and many dermatologists don't even believe that it exists. The lack of support and information leaves people struggling with TSW to diagnose themselves, find their own treatments, lose faith in medicine and be more vulnerable to misinformation. Like many others with TSW, I scoured Reddit and Facebook groups attempting to find something that would help. I tried everything from countless supplements to different lotions, creams, oils and all kinds of diets. What seems to work for some people will make symptoms worse for others, and everyone seems to be reaching in the dark for some sort of cure. The only reliable healer appears to be time ""î most people with TSW experience symptoms for months to years, a long journey that is not for the faint of heart. No one should have to go through something so preventable. If doctors were more responsible and patients were more aware of the condition, many cases of topical steroid withdrawal could be avoided. Right now, raising awareness is one of the most important things we can do to help prevent TSW.† Fortunately, the tide appears to be turning as more and more people are spreading awareness about the condition. Briana Banos, a TSW advocate who has been struggling with TSW since 2015, created a documentary called ""Preventable: Protecting our largest organ.""ù It shares her story, along with others from around the globe suffering from TSW, highlighting the urgent need to find ways to help them. The organization International Topical Steroid Awareness Network (ITSAN) works to educate people about TSW and even offers resources and support for those struggling with the condition. A study was recently published investigating the dermatopathology of TSW, or the mechanism by which the disease occurs. This research was the first of its kind to identify that TSW is medically distinct from eczema due to physiological markers and symptoms such as burning, flushing and thermodysregulation. Researchers found that TSW is associated with abnormally high levels of NAD+ oxidation due to increased expression of mitochondrial complex I as a result of exposure to steroids. NAD+ is linked to activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors that regulate itch, which may be the cause of the bone-deep itchiness I am all too familiar with. It also increases signaling of the transcription factor Wnt, which activates certain genes that result in symptoms associated with TSW. However, this study is currently waiting to be peer reviewed, meaning that it needs to be evaluated before it can be used to guide any sort of clinical practice. Despite this, the fact that new research is being conducted to study TSW is another step towards the condition being medically recognized and to finding a proper treatment.† For people struggling with TSW or moderate to severe eczema, there are fortunately other medication options now available that are not known to cause withdrawal symptoms. Some examples are biologics, which are a class of medicines that are isolated from organic sources such as humans, animals or microorganisms. Dupixent (dupilumab) and Adbry (tralokinumab-ldrm) are becoming common treatments for eczema and TSW.† In my journey with TSW, I initially refused to use any medications to treat my skin and wanted to heal naturally. But it proved to be very difficult to go about my daily life as normal. I was hanging on by a thread, rarely making it to class and other obligations, sleep deprived from insomnia and frequently bedridden due to painful flares. After months of this I decided it was time that I needed treatment and am now looking towards biologics as an option.† However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no ""cure""ù for TSW or eczema ""î these medications work to mask symptoms but do not treat the underlying cause of the condition. As a result, many patients who choose medication tend to be on them for life or until topical steroid withdrawal runs its course. Like so many others, I sought treatment for a mild skin condition and now find myself battling the severe symptoms of TSW as a result of simply following my doctor's instructions. The experience opened my eyes to the shortcomings of the medical community that have failed to be addressed. Patients deserve better care and transparency about the potential risks of treatments, with healthcare providers taking responsibility for understanding and communicating these risks. Despite the ongoing struggle, there is hope as individuals among the TSW community continue to raise awareness and advocate for change in the medical community. I am confident that topical steroid withdrawal will someday be a recognized and treatable diagnosis that, most importantly, is prevented.
