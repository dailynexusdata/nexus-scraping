la-vista,Introduciendo La Vista,Introducing The View,"After two years of dedication and too many Zoom conferences, we are proud to announce the creation of La Vista, the new Spanish section of the Daily Nexus, with the goal of becoming a more inclusive and representative space for the UC Santa Spanish-speaking community. Barbara. Daniela Gomez / Daily Nexus The Daily Nexus, originally known as El íguila, began printing in 1930 and has undergone many changes since then. In 2015, UCSB was designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution; However, Daily Nexus' coverage does not accurately reflect this. We serve the student population, but at this time, that only extends to the English-speaking population at UCSB and Isla Vista. In the 2021-22 school year, Latino and Chicano students represented 27% of the UCSB student body. In order to meet the expectations of a Hispanic-serving institution, we seek to diversify our media coverage to include the Hispanic and Latino communities, providing Spanish translations of Nexus articles, as well as our own original content in Spanish, covering local news, arts and culture, and more. We, the creators of La Vista, grew up watching popular Spanish-language television shows like Univision and Telemundo and recognize the importance of these shows to the communities around us. Coming to UCSB and being part of the Nexus and the Hispanic and Latino population, we felt that this element of community was missing. We understand the importance of Hispanic media, not only at the national level, but at the university campus level. The incorporation of Spanish media into the Daily Nexus has a two-phase purpose: to diversify our media coverage, but also to create a home for those who long for a sense of community."
la-vista,"""Euforia"": ¿un caso de éxtasis o miseria?","""Euphoria"": a case of ecstasy or misery?","Written by Zuri Wilson Translated by Nora Okamoto The link for the English version There is something that is both charming and extremely heartbreaking about the Netflix series called ""Euphoria"", by Sam Levinson, the series that manages to evoke the opposite of its title while living up to his title, simultaneously. Esmé Puzio / Daily Nexus “Euforia” tells the story of Rue, a teenager navigating mental health, drug abuse and social issues among a cast of actors. Since its release, ""Euforia"" has quickly become a cultural phenomenon due to its stimulating visual cinematography, soundtrack and acting talent, and has grown in popularity with the recent premiere of Season 2. However, among the praise of series, a common controversy raised by many is its extensive depiction of drug culture and whether or not it glorifies and glamorizes drug use. A leading reviewer of the series, D. A. R. E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), criticized ""Euphoria"" for glorifying drug use and illustrating it as common and normalized in the lives of today's teenagers, even requesting a meeting with Levinson. First, let's put this statement in the context of what glamor and glorification mean. According to Merriam Webster, ""glamorize"" means to represent something as glamorous or romantic. Similarly, Merriam Webster describes the meaning of “glorify” as representing something admirable and honorable. It seems reasonable that people perceive the series to achieve both; The show itself appears visually glamorous between the bright makeup and vibrant colors. However, these aspects serve to corroborate the overall message of the series: beneath the glitz and glamor lies a dangerous, terrifying, and heartbreaking reality of mental health and drug abuse. Therefore, I would argue that the show does not, in fact, glorify drug use, but instead projects a realistic perspective on teenage drug abuse and its devastating effects on the individual and their relationships. I can't evaluate the glamorization of ""Euphoria"", or rather the lack thereof, without referencing specific moments in the show, especially moments within the new season. So, before you read on, be warned: there will be spoilers for seasons 1 and 2, read at your own risk. Don't say I didn't warn you. Okay, now that that's established, let's dive in. D. A. R. E. may claim that ""Euphoria"" glorifies drug use. However, if glamor means making something look desirable, then Euphoria certainly doesn't do that. Watching Rue in the first season, viewers are quickly exposed to difficult and heartbreaking scenes: Rue's sister finding her unconscious on the floor due to an overdose, the many fights between Rue and her mother, and more. One of the hardest scenes to watch during the first season was when Rue was banging on her friend Fez's door in anger, begging him for drugs. Seeing Rue hurling such damaging insults, viewers feel her desperation to satisfy the cravings caused by her drug use, even if it harms those she loves. These are the types of effects that drugs can have on an individual, and ""Euphoria"" doesn't shy away from showing that. One of the first times we see Rue truly happy on the show, smiling and laughing, is after she stops using drugs and begins to repair her relationships. Viewers watch Rue skate with Jules and Lexi, genuinely laughing and having fun. Here, we see Rue hiding beneath the influences and effects of the drugs she consumes. However, the first season shows us that this happiness is temporary, giving life to an interesting dichotomy: the relationship that drugs have with mental health. In fact, this complicated relationship is one of the central themes of ""Euphoria"". This conversation actually comes to fruition after season 1, during Rue's one-hour special episode. In particular, this episode features a long conversation between Rue and her sponsor, Ali. During this argument, Rue makes the heartbreaking comment that drugs are probably the only reason she's still alive. Rue's anxiety and struggles with depression contribute to her drug use as she uses them to escape the thoughts and feelings in her head, illustrating another reason why Euphoria is so prolific and impactful. . For Rue, drugs are the only thing she sees that makes her life worth living. This is not a glamorous discovery at all. This episode is important and impactful for many more reasons, showing what the series is about. Much of the reasoning behind people claiming that ""Euphoria"" glamorizes drug use is due to the stylish makeup production and lush cinematography that complements the series. However, in this episode, the parties, makeup, and fancy suits are stripped away. Instead, viewers are left with an intense character analysis between Rue and Ali, who makes heartbreaking discoveries and discovers ""Euphoria"" for what it is: a moving and tragic story about a high school student in an internal battle with herself over mental health and drug use, and the consequences of that reality. This episode illuminates the complexity of drug abuse, as Rue exposes her many regrets in the ways she treated her loved ones due to drugs, while also expressing her ""need"" for them to cope with her depression, anxiety and feelings about losing his father. So what happens when you bring back lighting and makeup, the aspects of the show that are considered glamorous? Is the message of the program lost? I would say no. Season 2, so far, has really shown Rue's intense downward spiral deeper and deeper into drug abuse. The final episodes, 4 and 5, show her cutting ties with everyone she loves and those who love her. She hurts her sister, says hurtful things to her girlfriend, disrespects one of her only mentors and supporters, and gets physically violent with her friends and family in search of drugs. Witnessing Rue's psychological spiral and then witnessing the heartbreaking aftermath demonstrates an accurate and raw depiction of how drugs can affect everyone involved. None of it is admirable and the cinematography and overall aesthetic don't detract from what's happening; instead, she immerses us in Rue's world in sensory overload so that, as audience members, we can experience the temporary euphoria she feels. With makeup, music and cinematography, we transcend the colorful vitality that drugs give to the world. However, that feeling is temporary, and when that glamor wears off, we are left with the heartbreaking truth of the consequences that follow. Rue's constant transition from anger to immense sadness at her actions highlights the internal turmoil that arises from drug abuse. None of this is glamorous. None of this is glorified. Instead, the show uses the seemingly glamorous aspects as a tool to highlight the initial attraction of what it's like to be high and then contradict it with the reality of what happens when that high wears off and you're faced with the consequences of your actions. This way, viewers can truly understand the appeal and effects of drug use. Beautiful photography doesn't take away from the message, it enhances it. However, this message is easily misinterpreted due to the popularity of the show. Fans of the show throw “Euforia”-themed parties, post “Euforia”-themed makeup tutorials, and even post memes that come from “Euforia” content. I mean, this makes sense. ""Euphoria"" has solidified as a cultural statement and its prominence, popularity and aesthetics contribute to this. People are attracted to her. However, as we have seen, Rue's life is far from glamorous. ""Euforia""'s depiction of the realities of drug use illuminates the way it can ruin friendships and family relationships and even affect one's self-perception. Not only that, but it's also very impactful in showing the traumatic and difficult events each character goes through that leads them to where they are now, unpacking the impact of mental health issues in the process. To be guilty of glorifying drug use, the show would have to portray it as idealistic and admirable. However, ""Euphoria"" does the opposite; sparks conversation and raises awareness about mental health issues and drug abuse. So, the next time you watch ""Euphoria,"" try not to get caught up in the show's vibrant aesthetic, but rather, delve deeper into the series. If you do, you will discover the crux of the message of ""Euphoria"" and the struggles that these characters, specifically Rue, are going through. Zuri Wilson believes that ""Euphoria"" uses ecstasy to convey the raw misery and reality of drug use in today's culture."
la-vista,"Cinco años después, el fútbol femenino de Estados Unidos gana la igualdad salarial","Five years later, US women's soccer wins equal pay","Written by Abagail Monti Translated by Nora Okamoto Linked to the English version On Feb 22. In 2021, the United States women's national soccer team's six-year battle for equal pay finally concluded, resulting in a victory against gender discrimination. Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus The original lawsuit, which accused the United States Soccer Committee of pay discrimination and unequal working conditions, was filed in 2016 by players Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Becky Sauerbrunn and Hope Solo. When that was unsuccessful, 28 players sued the United States Soccer Federation again in 2019. They argued that female players were paid less than male players despite their greater success, which is an understatement for dramatic proportions. The women's national team has four Olympic gold medals and four World Cup titles, while the men's national team has never won either. Despite this astonishing fact, in 2020, Chief Justice Robert Gary Klausner ruled against the US women's national team's equality claims. However, the United States women's national team persisted, filing an appeal in 2021 that eventually found its way back to court. Despite years of denial, the United States Soccer Federation agreed last week to pay $24 million to finalize the deal. A total of 22 million will go directly to the athletes as compensation for years of unequal pay, and the remaining 2 million will create a fund for charitable grants and to secure the finances of the players after they retire as athletes. One of the reasons, among many, that the women's victory came to fruition after six years of lawsuits is Cindy Parlow Cone, who replaced Carlos Cordeiro in 2020 as the first president of the United States Soccer Federation. As a former women's national team player, Cone understood the pressing need for equal pay and helped execute the demands of the United States women's national team. Although the settlement is nowhere near the $66 million in back pay that was initially demanded, most players agree that the smaller settlement still represents a substantial victory for female athletes around the world. More significant, perhaps, was the United States Soccer Federation's commitment to keep salary rates the same for all future tournaments and games. While the multibillion-dollar deal resolved pay inequality issues domestically, much of the international issue remains in the hands of FIFA, soccer's global governing body. FIFA hands out exponentially larger payments for the men's World Cup tournament than for the women's, which makes up the majority of the pay gap. Honorably, the United States Men's National Team has agreed to share and deliver millions of dollars in future FIFA World Cup payments to maintain equality for the United States National Soccer Teams. The consequences of this agreement have echoed around the world, inspiring other national teams to push for equality. Ireland, Norway, Australia and the Netherlands are just some of the countries that have recently gained national support to close the gender pay gap in football. It is important to note that the multi-billion dollar deal has not yet been officially cemented. The deal remains contingent on the ratification of a collective bargaining agreement (or CBA) for the United States women's national team and final court approval. In terms of equality between men and women in all sports, this is a small step in a much longer journey. Therefore, while this feat of persistence and strength deserves to be celebrated, the world must continue to strive for the best."

la-vista,¡Digan Queso! Alternativos al queso vegano en el cooperativo de Isla Vista,Say Cheese! Alternatives to vegan cheese at the Isla Vista cooperative,"Written by Yuriko Chavez and Haydin Zogaric Translated by Pricila Flores Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus In recent years, vegan food has taken over the culinary world. From impossible meat to various milk substitutes, plant-based meals are growing. For many non-vegans, these meat and dairy alternatives may seem unnecessary. However, switching to vegan alternatives is glebe in numerous ways; It is healthy, ecological, and prevents harm to animals. On April 6, the Isla Vista Food Cooperative hosted a vegan cheese tasting for vegans and non-vegans alike. Isla Vista Food Co-op marketing and outreach manager Allison Baymiller, also a UC Santa Barbara alumna, led the event. She said the reason the cooperative decided to promote vegan cheeses instead of dairy cheeses is ""because of the variable environmental impact where there are high land and water uses associated with sustainably raising dairy cows."" Vegan cheese is often made from cashews, which provide a creamy, nutty flavor, and are fermented to enhance the tangy, aged flavor of dairy cheese. She elaborated on the environmental impact being positive, while also recognizing that cheeses made from nuts can also have a high water consumption and fair trade impact. ""There's some of that to consider with the environmental and social impact as well,"" Baymiller said. “But, there is still less animal use associated with vegan cheese.” Yuriko Chavez, second-year Chicano studies major, and Haydin Zogaric, first-year political science and global studies double major, tried the cooperative variety of vegan cheeses for that you don't have"" but you're definitely going to want to try. Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus Loco por Queso Súper Azul ($8.99) The food co-op in Isla Vista is currently highlighting Loco por Queso, a UK-based vegan cheese company specializing in artisanal, dairy-free cheeses. First on their list is their “super blue cheese”—a semi-firm, aromatic wedge of blue cheese layered with spirulina, or blue algae, to create that classic blue look. And: Blue cheese is currently one of my favorite cheeses! Admittedly, I was a little skeptical whether vegan cheese will be able to fully capture its crumbly character and strong aftertaste. However, I was pleasantly surprised that ""super blue"" was intense, creamy, aromatic, and had a nice pungent punch reminiscent of that strong aftertaste of classic white cheese. The main component that was different from dairy cheese was that it was not as crumbly, instead having a similar character to that of hummus. Rating: 5/5 H: Although blue cheese is not my personal favorite, I enjoyed trying this cheese and would recommend it to those who are hesitant toward eating penicillium, or edible mold, in dairy blue cheese. ""Super Blue"" is exactly what I expected from a blue cheese, from the distinct pungency to the creamy texture. It will be a good substitute for blue cheese in any recipe, such as a fresh Cobb salad or a creamy dressing or dip. Rating: 2/5 Loco por Queso, Queso Ajo Negro The “Black Garlic Taste” of Loco Por Queso is an earthy, garlicky, semi-firm wedge with an activated charcoal peel. And: Like a fervent lover of the garlic, I was more excited about this cheese. Although the intense and creamy texture was maintained with a subtle hint of garlic, I was not a fan of this cheese. The beginnings were very subtle. I can see it working more as an addition to it. other ingredients and flavors. The Rating: 2/5 H: I could eat this whole cheese wedge! It had the perfect amount of acidity and creamy texture with subtle hints of garlic. The activated charcoal gives it a unique depth and smokiness. However, as an enthusiastic garlic lover, I agree that they could definitely up the garlic flavor. This cheese was a good pairing with the crunchy, crunchy, seed-filled Mary's Gone Crackers also sold at the co-op. . The Rating: 4/5 Crazy for Cheese, Artichoke and Herbs Cheese ($8.99) The last flavor we tried from Crazy for Cheese was ""Artichoke and Herbs"", a semi-firm wedge with a nutty and artichoke flavor and hints of fresh herbs . And: This cheese had beautiful flavors, the hints of artichoke paired the herbs well. It's a versatile cheese with a good balance of flavor and creaminess, and I could see it pairing well with fruit and bread. The Rating: 3/5 H: In my opinion, this cheese outshone the others! Absolutely love the soft and subtle style of the artichoke with the brightness of the lemon and basil. It's so creamy and versatile; It would work well with any cookie or bread in any context, from afternoon snack to a sophisticated charcuterie board. Rating 5/5 We were very impressed with the Loco por Queso collection! You would never have guessed that their creamy, flavorful cheeses are plant-based and dairy-free. We recommend a check out their website, including a recipe page that posts luxurious dishes using these cheeses! Miyokos Dairy Sun-Dried Tomato Cheese ($8.99) The next cheese on the itinerary to try is from Miyokos Dairy, which Baymiller described as “first on the scene for vegan cheese.” Miyoko boasts its large collection of creamy vegan cheeses including their soft, spreadable cheeses in the “double creamy sun-dried tomato garlic” flavor. And: This cheese had a different texture from the others; It wasn't creamy and didn't feel as spreadable as the others mentioned. I enjoyed that I could pick up more hints of garlic than I could in the black garlic cheese, and the slices of the sun-dried tomatoes were a nice addition to the flavor. Although the flavors were good, I feel that the cream is a very important factor for the cheese and this to me tastes more like a good style of hummus instead of cheese. H: The sweetness of sun-dried tomatoes definitely takes center stage in this cheese with a creamy spread. Notes of garlic contribute to the savory and robust flavor. It reminds me of Italian food, like the smell of garlic sautéed in boiling tomato sauce. I see it working well with a pasta dish melted into a toasted cheese sandwich or bagel. The Rating: 3/5 Haydin Zogaric / Daily Nexus Violife Same As Feta Cheese ($4.49) Violife, a wildly popular and lauded vegan cheese company, says its Same As Feta is a nod to its start in Thessaloniki, Greece . It is a cheese based on potato starch soaked in a salty brine. Y: This was, personally, my favorite cheese! It had a soft, buttery quality that beautifully fulfilled a slice of apple. It doesn't crumble easily like feta, but the flavor was remarkably similar and intensely refreshing compared to a fruit. I'm definitely going to buy it, as it only has a fresh and creamy flavor, but also versatile for salads and fruits. It is also the most environmentally friendly because it does not rely on dairy or nuts. The Rating: 5/5 H: Before you bite into this cheese, you might smell the familiar, pungent odor associated with Greek feta. It was pleasantly strong and bright with delicious creamy texture ""” incredibly precise to dairy feta. It will be perfect for breaking up a Greek salad or baked with filo pastry and agave nectar for an elevated appetizer. The Rating: 4.5/5 Although none of us We are vegan, we absolutely enjoy indulging in the Cooperative's vegan cheese. They are just as creamy, decadent and delicious as dairy cheese, although having less impact on the environment or animals. We encourage you to try them for yourself ""” pay a visit on the la. vegan section at the food cooperative in Isla Vista, where you can buy all of these cheeses and more.

la-vista,Los estudiantes universitarios pueden ser saludables en Isla Vista?,Can college students be healthy in Isla Vista?,"Written by: Athina Mihalopoulos Translated by: Nora Okamoto Daniela Gomez / Daily Nexus Leaving the comfort of my home and going to university has been very exciting, as I am finally independent to do what I want. However, it has also involved taking complete care of my body and myself. This is probably the hardest thing I have done since moving to Isla Vista, mainly because maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be expensive and demanding. That's what most college students lack: time and money. Which results in more than 70% of college students eating fast food at least once a day, according to a 2015 study. Considering how stressful and arduous college life is, fast food may seem like a solution. smart, but it may not be the best way to get enough energy and nutrients for good overall well-being. Many students might be satisfied with that way of life and think that since it works, there is no reason to change it. I could eat fast food every day and still feel healthy, but my lifestyle now is also what could determine my health when I'm older. Several studies conducted in Western countries revealed that changing the typical American diet and lifestyle could prevent most cases of coronary artery disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular problems and many cancers. The World Health Organization published a report in 2003 that highlighted certain dietary changes that could protect you from developing some chronic diseases. Specifically, the report suggests that replacing saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats, as well as limiting sugar and sodium intake, could have positive long-term health effects. Not surprisingly, most fast foods are high in sugar, saturated fat, and trans fat, making it one of the most dangerous food choices college students make. The COVID-19 pandemic is another reason to fight for a strong immune system. With in-person classes, there is always the risk of contracting the virus, and along with the protection we take by wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, taking care of our bodies is an additional step we can take to combat the virus. Strengthening a good immune system requires eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and foods with healthy fats. A study conducted in six countries in 2021 found that people who followed a plant-based or pescetarian diet were less likely to contract COVID-19 at moderate to severe levels. Although a good immune system does not guarantee that you will not contract COVID, it can ensure that the body is more prepared to fight the virus and has fewer health consequences. Before moving to Isla Vista, I heard stories about the many illnesses that circulate at UCSB and how common it is to get sick. After two years living here, I agree that Isla Vista is indeed very prone to disease outbreaks, and I constantly see students getting sick with the flu, respiratory infections, mononucleosis, or strep throat. This is one more reason why it is important to keep our immune systems healthy and take care of our bodies while we live here. A study was conducted in the United States to find out what percentage of college students had been diagnosed with health problems in the last 12 months as of fall 2020, and it turned out that 28.2% of college students had to deal with a virus or a respiratory illness. Sometimes being healthy is not only important for our health, but also for environmental sustainability. As shocking as it may sound, the food choices we make every day directly affect the environment and global warming emissions. There are foods that require more energy and release more pollution, such as highly processed foods and foods higher on the food chain, which contribute to many environmental concerns. Conversely, foods lower on the food chain and fresh, organic foods can reduce our carbon footprint. The fast food industry is known for its excessive fuel consumption, waste of disposable packaging, water pollution and the emission of volatile organic compounds, which are extremely harmful to our planet. Hopefully, knowing that impact can serve as another reason to stay away from fast food and build a sustainable lifestyle. Even though you argue that being healthy in college is very important, many might protest that they don't have the time or money to adapt to all those habits and maintain a healthy lifestyle, especially in a city like I.V. that has limited food options. However, after researching all the markets and food stores in our city, I believe there are many ways to stay healthy without it being expensive and time-consuming. When it comes to grocery shopping, I always have the Isla Vista Food Cooperative (Co-op) in mind. The Cooperative is just one block from campus, and is Santa Barbara County's only community-owned grocery store. This means it contains high-quality products from local farmers. Two of the Cooperative's strategic priorities are providing access to nutritious, high-quality, economically accessible and culturally inclusive foods, as well as modeling environmentally sustainable products. I've been shopping there since I moved here, and I can always find well-priced food options that are also quick and easy to cook. When I have free time during the week, I always choose to buy my fruits and vegetables at the Mercado Camino Real farmers market in Goleta. Shopping at a farmers market not only supports family farmers, but also protects the environment and nourishes the body. Food at the farmers' market is grown with sustainable methods and transported over shorter distances, avoiding the environmental damage caused by large conventional agriculture chains that pollute water, land and air. Therefore, it is always a good idea to prefer foods grown with sustainable techniques instead of the highly processed foods found in supermarkets. If the price of healthy food seems to be a barrier, applying for CalFresh is my next suggestion. California's food stamp program can be indispensable for those who do not have a large grocery budget. All you need to do is apply, and once approved, you'll get a fresh grocery EBT card that works at most grocery stores and markets. All eligibility requirements for CalFresh can be found on the UCSB Basic Needs Resources website, and it is a great option for students who are also eligible for Work Study. UCSB also has Basic Needs Advocates who can streamline the CalFresh process for students, so be sure to stop by the Student Needs Advising Center at UCen to get all the support you need. Fresh, free, nutritious food can also be found at the Associated Students Food Bank. It is located at the UCen, next to the Ortega entrance, and is open Monday to Thursday from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Fridays from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. There are times when I don't have the time or energy to go. to the food bank or the Co-op, and I begin to debate whether I should order fast food as a solution. That's when I remember that there are quick solutions in our town that don't involve processed foods. Through Instacart, you can order groceries online, choosing from a wide variety of sustainable grocery options, and it will be delivered to you within hours. If that's too time-consuming, try ordering something through the 10-minute delivery services Snag or Duffel. Both stores have healthy options that can nutritiously satisfy you on a stressful study night when you don't have time to go out or cook. In general, it is not as expensive or time-consuming to live a healthy lifestyle as most people assume. It all comes down to the decisions you make every day and the priorities you set. Healthy food choices can be combined with other daily habits, such as using a bicycle instead of a car, joining a sports club for exercise. Since early adulthood is a period of physical and mental development, it is important that we make the right choices for our bodies and take care of ourselves as best we can. Athina Mihalopoulos argues that there are ways to be healthy as a college student living in Isla Vista without it being expensive and time-consuming."

According to the press release, these changes are planned to last through the spring and summer, and any additional adjustments will be communicated by MTD. “The reliability of our schedules is crucial and due to the current labor shortage, temporarily reducing service is a necessary step,” MTD General Manager Jerry Estrada said in the press release. ""We hope that these temporary reductions will allow us time to work properly and return to higher levels of service later this year."""
la-vista,"Zócalo, un pedazo de la ciudad de México, llega a Isla Vista","Zócalo, a piece of Mexico City, comes to Isla Vista","The Hernández family (left to right) Jaime Hernández Jr., Olivia Hernández, Edwin Hernández, Hannia Hernandez and Jaime Hernández Sr. Ewa Zakrzewska / Daily Nexus On April 1, 2022 Isla Vista welcomed a Mexican family restaurant, Zócalo. The idea for the restaurant began when the previous tenants of the space went to the father of the family, Jaime Hernández Sr., when they were closing their business and were offered the space. At first, Jaime Sr. Hernández expressed doubts about the business, but after a year, he accepted. Now that the restaurant is open, the family describes this story as if it were destiny. The family felt it was a sign of fate that Jaime Hernández Jr. finished his last exam to complete his chemistry degree on the same day and time that the previous tenants moved out. They thought they should open Zócalo because of the timing of the two incidents. ""[We thought] If the Lord wants, by March if [Jaime Jr.] finishes his [school] career then it will be [true] and if not, well we really don't want to. And everything was like that, exactly how it happened, "" Hernandez Sr. said. Mexico City is home to Zócalo Square, where people celebrate and everyone feels the cry of independence. Now, Isla Vista has its own piece of Mexico, the new restaurant, Zócalo. Zócalo opened to integrate authentic Mexican food to Isla Vista. The restaurant is run by the Hernández family. Jaime Hernández Jr., a recent first-generation chemistry graduate and the eldest son of the Hernández family, took care of all the administrative matters before they opened. Hernández Jr. did not have a restaurant in his plans, however today he sees it as a backup plan. ""The restaurant plan is like a retirement plan for my parents. They took care of me when I was little and this is my way of taking care of them and if it works, I can go start my degree in chemistry,"" Hernández Jr. said. The family emigrated to the United States after Jaime was born and settled in Carpintería. Olivia Hernández, the mother of the family, grew up in a small town in the State of Mexico and has worked in restaurants as a prep cook. Additionally, Jaime Sr. grew up in Mexico City and also worked in many restaurants. These jobs gave them the experience to know how to run a restaurant and be directors of Zócalo. ""Since my childhood, I have worked as a dishwasher. I started on a soda box and I climbed up there to wash the dishes because I was very small. That was in Mexico and there I went up to the kitchen, to cook, I was a bartender, here In the United States I worked in many restaurants,"" Hernández Sr. said. While Jaime Jr. Hernández covered the administrative work and completed his studies, the entire family was working in the restaurant. ""We are all part of the restaurant, my son is more into the technology, how the menu works, he is in charge of everything administrative but he is also part of the kitchen,"" Hernández Sr. said. Although most of the family can support the restaurant physically, the family's daughter, Hannia Hernández, a student at UC Los Angeles, is in charge of the social media presence. Although he can't be there to help every day, he has found alternative ways to help despite the distance. The youngest son, Edwin Hernández, designed the website and is also working on designing merchandise such as shirts. ""Other people take months to learn the cashier system at a restaurant but he learned it in an hour,"" Hernández Jr. said. As they approached opening their doors, they knew they wanted to make Zócalo unique. ""We walked the streets of Isla Vista and noticed that no one says hello anymore. We want this restaurant to feel like home,"" Hernández Sr. said. In addition to the culture of the restaurant, they also want to make their menu unique. ""Breakfast was one of those things that we think that sometimes young people can no longer enjoy breakfast because they missed the morning. There are many who crave a bagel in the afternoon with bacon and chipotle cream. In the afternoons We can see we're almost out of bagels,"" Hernandez Sr. said. Featuring bagels and other more traditionally Mexican foods, Zócalo offers a menu that includes a variety of drinks from traditional agua frescoes to a horchata made in-house. Additionally, the menu is always developing. The family is always looking to grow their menu and make it even more unique. The horchata made in the restaurant. There is also an option to add coffee to the drink. Ewa Zakrzewska / Daily Nexus With this menu, Zócalo prioritizes and remains proud that they use the best and freshest ingredients. Olivia Hernández laughs as she tells us that although she is not going to give us her recipe, she emphasizes that everything is natural. ""Everything is natural. Even the seasonings, when you walk into the kitchen, the only thing you find is garlic salt, but all the ingredients are natural,"" Olivia Hernández said. Hernandez Sr. also agrees with this. ""We don't just grab any meat from the store. We try to buy the best meat and we know that even if it is a little expensive, we want to give the best so that customers can feel that freshness in the food,"" Hernández Sr. said. As soon as they opened the doors to the Isla Vista community, they realized that the restaurant had a huge impact on their lives. In addition to their unique menu, they also want to offer this place for the community. ""A girl said, 'I came yesterday, I'm embarrassed to come' and I told her not to be embarrassed. She had a guava and I offered her a piece and she said 'or really?' and when she I said yes, he told me that he feels a lot of love and I was like, wow,"" Olivia Hernández said. Zócalo in Mexico City reminds the family of their home. Now, they want Zócalo in Isla Vista to bring a taste of home to college students. ""Zócalo is a place where everyone gathers, where they can share and where they can come to a place that feels like home. You can come and taste that seasoning that you miss from home,"" Hernández Sr. said."

UU.,Vice President Kamala Harris visits Vandenberg Space Force Base and announces ban on US anti-satellite missile testing.,"Written by: Atmika Iyer and Mark Alfred Translated by: Jaynar de la Cruz Ochoa United States Vice President Kamala Harris joined Congressman Salud Carbajal and Senator Alex Padilla at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Lompoc on 18 April. Speaking before members of the U.S. Space Force, known as Guardians, Harris announced that the United States would become the first nation to commit to not launching missiles aimed at satellites in space. Mark Alfred / Daily Nexus Harris, accompanied by Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, landed aboard Air Force Two at approximately 2:45 p.m. m. and greeted his former teammates from California, Carbajal and Padilla. From there, the vice president was motored to a private briefing at the Combined Space Operations Center, followed by a private meeting with service members and their families. Around 4:40 p.m. m., a series of speakers took the stage in a warehouse at the Vandenberg base to highlight the importance of the Space Force, along with its ties to the Central Coast. Speakers include Carbajal, Padilla, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and Harris. In her speech, Harris highlighted the importance of the United States Space Force, citing its efforts to clear dangerous debris left behind by a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007. ""I just received a report from the 18th Defense Squadron space and his work is incredibly impressive,"" said Harris. ""So far, the 18th has identified more than 1,600 pieces of debris from the Russian test. This debris presents a risk to the safety of our astronauts, our satellites, and our growing commercial presence."" Harris discussed how the United States is setting new norms for how countries behave and use space, announcing the United States' intention to ban the launch of missiles aimed at satellites in space, and said the current administration will take up the work of encouraging other countries to follow their example. ""We have consistently condemned these tests and called them reckless, but that is not enough. Today, we go further. I am pleased to announce that, starting today, the United States is committing to no destructive testing of direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles. Simply put, these tests are dangerous and we will not pass them,"" Harris said. ""We are the first nation to make such a commitment. And today, on behalf of the United States of America, I call on all nations to join us, whether a nation goes to space or not,"" he continued . ""We believe this will benefit everyone, just as space benefits everyone. In the coming days and months, we will work with other nations to establish this as a new international standard for responsible behavior in space."" During his speech, Carbajal recognized the importance of Vandenberg's location and said that the central coast is preparing to accelerate the work being carried out at the base. ""We are preparing for a possible doubling of launch rates over the next five years and are preparing, if and when the Space Force comes calling, to make Vandenberg the new headquarters for STARCOM [Space Training and Readiness Command]"" , said Carbajal. Senator Padilla said the Vandenberg Space Force Base will be a leader in space operations in the 21st century. ""Not only do I see Vandenberg as strategically perfect for this and other missions, because of how close it is geographically to cutting-edge aerospace technologies. ""Not to mention that some of the best universities in the world are also here,"" Padilla said. ""I know everyone here had the opportunity today to see how Vandenberg can and will be a leader in 21st century space operations."" The Biden/Harris administration pledged $27.6 billion to the United States Space Force for the 2022-23 fiscal year. According to Hicks, this is the largest amount of military space spending of any administration. ""Funds two more GPS satellites and invests in the development of secure, survivable satellite communications and funds the Department of Defense's transition to a new resilient missile warning and missile tracking architecture. Every nation on Earth benefits from space"" , Hicks said. Harris also addressed the role of the Space Force as the Biden/Harris administration navigates Russian aggression toward Ukraine. ""As we have seen in Ukraine, Russia has completely violated the set of international rules and norms established after World War II, which [had] provided unprecedented peace and security in Europe,"" Harris said. ""In the face of Russian brutality, the worlds come together to say these roles, and these rules and norms must be respected. I am heartened to see such a strong affirmation of their importance."" ""At the same time, our administration is working to establish new rules and regulations for the new challenges of the 21st century, areas such as emerging technologies, cybersecurity and, of course, space,"" he continued. Harris left the base at approximately 6 p.m. to attend a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Los Angeles."
la-vista,Nexus descubre la nueva maqueta de Munger Hall,Nexus discovers the new model of Munger Hall,"Written by Mark Alfred Translated by Mariana Benitez Arreola Just north of the Santa Ynez apartment complex at UC Santa Barbara, there is a warehouse that is home to the model of Munger Hall. Warehouse of the model of Munger Hall. Mark Alfred / Daily Nexus This past November, they sent photos to Nexus detailing the large-scale model of a two-story house, including a kitchen, a common area, and the infamous windowless rooms. New images taken last week and obtained from the Nexus from an anonymous source reflect a number of changes to the proposed idea. The previously furnished shelves and walls were decorated to look as if the students were living in the model. A ""90s Movie Night"" poster appears on freshly painted hallway walls. A new installation occurs in the place of tables and chairs, which have been moved to the common area to function as study desks. Room spaces underwent the most drastic changes, with the furniture all being replaced with shelves, furniture, a bed frame and a desk. The old ceiling light has been replaced with an overhead fan. The rooms are newly equipped. with personal items and various decorations representing the lifestyle of a hypothetical student in that 70-by-20-foot room. This proposed mega dormitory sparked national outrage last year for its unique design. The mockup was recently visited by some students from the school. advanced environmental planning course, ENV 135B taught by Professor Rita Bright, which gave them a tour of the model after the Nexus became public last year. Nexus also identified the location of the warehouse where it is keeping the model: 389 South Los Carneros Road. Formerly the location of Mammoth Moving and Storage, Inc. The warehouse has done little to advertise the current contents ""up to keeping the rusty MAMMOTH sign outside on the wall.

Vans belonging to Oak Harbor Freight Lines, Inc. ““a West Coast-based transportation brand”“ can also be seen transporting warehouse products. The company does not have locations in Goleta or Santa Barbara, the closest being Santa Maria. Currently, UCSB spokesperson Shelly Leachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment through the university's warehouse operations. Leachman told The Nexus that the project is being funded by ""the donor,"" referring to billionaire and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charles Munger, who designed the controversial dormitory being proposed.

""In January, I had the idea of ​​having an event where we would make a collage of handprints and have 'We stand with the survivors' in several different languages. That was the multicultural [aspect],"" Cheenath said. . A long table was set up where people could paint on their own mini canvases, along with a large collaborative canvas where people put their painted handprints. Some painted their country's flag on their hand to incorporate their cultural background into their handprint. At least 50 people attended and the event continued until 3 pm.

la-vista,El Impacto desproporcionado de la pandemia en los trabajadores esenciales migrantes en California,The Disproportionate Impact of the Pandemic on Migrant Essential Workers in California,"Written by: Opinion Editor Translated by: Nora Okamoto Daniela Gomez / Daily Nexus It has been more than two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began in the United States. And it's time we listen to the workers who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic in California: migrant essential workers. Since the start of the pandemic, essential workers have been simultaneously celebrated and disrespected in America. Some community members and allies have shown their support for essential workers through statements of solidarity and by including themselves in communication platforms such as news articles and documentaries. Despite this, the workers are worn out. They have treated them as disposable, they have yelled at them, and they have even physically attacked them. In California, some media outlets have focused on the pandemic experiences of a specific category of essential workers: migrant workers. These workers, people born outside the United States and employed in an essential workplace, make up one-third of the state's essential workforce. To date, news stories about these community members have highlighted the experiences of poor or lower-middle class farm workers, often of Mexican or Central American origin. This raises additional questions: What are the experiences of migrant essential workers outside of agriculture? What about people from other demographic backgrounds? For the past eleven months, members of our team at the Center for Public Engagement Scholarship at the University of California, Santa Barbara have sought to answer these questions by facilitating in-depth conversations with 40 migrant essential workers across California. The people we spoke to came from 16 different countries across five continents. We have spoken with black, Asian, Latinx, white and multiracial people; We've talked to people who live in urban, suburban and rural communities; and we've talked to poor, working-class, and middle-class workers. We've heard about their work, their health, their aspirations and what they want people to know about their experiences during the pandemic. Here are four things we've learned from them: First, migrant essential workers work in a variety of industries. Although many understand “migrant essential worker” to primarily refer to those who work in California's agricultural industry, the California State Government lists 13 different sectors and hundreds of jobs that could be considered essential workplaces for migrants. The people we spoke to came from 35 different occupations, ranging from information technologists at financial software companies to refugee interpreters, nannies, manufacturing warehouse workers and chemists. We learned that although all migrant essential workers are on the “front line,” this front line is multifaceted: sometimes it is physical, sometimes it is digital. There are several important relief programs in California that are specifically designed to help those in historically dangerous and neglected occupations, such as agricultural and healthcare workers. But it is also important that policies support the large number of professions occupied by other migrant essential workers. Second, migrant essential workers have a wide variety of experiences in their workplaces. We hear many stories about dangers and stress in the workplace. For example, a supermarket worker told us she was afraid of having to ask customers to wear a mask to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Another, a mother of two young children, shared that she was overworked and tired, sometimes working more than 100 hours a week as a hospital receptionist. On the other hand, the pandemic provided significant flexibility to others. As one financial aid counselor said, “It was a privilege to literally be able to stay in my room and not have to physically interact with anyone.”This luxury was not something that all essential workers could access. Those who worked from home, however, were not exempt from work-related stress. They often experienced what we call a “pandemic health paradox” of intense stress and well-being. One teacher told us that the pandemic years were some of his “most difficult as an educator.”But, they were also when he felt most supported by his bosses. Third, migrant essential workers of color experience inequalities in the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed health care inequities and racial disparities for migrant essential workers, many, if not most, of whom are also people of color. People of color are at higher risk of severe illness if they contract COVID-19 due to higher rates of underlying health conditions such as asthma, hypertension and diabetes compared to white people. Additionally, hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 disproportionately affect Black people. What we learned from our interviewees is that many migrant essential workers were uninsured and lacked the usual source of quality care, which was an impediment to accessing COVID-19 testing and treatment services. One supermarket customer who lives in a rural area told us that “it's always hard to find good medical care. Nowadays I still have to drive an hour and a half to take my kids to the pediatrician.” Many migrant essential workers of color told us that They just wish medical services were “more active, better and faster.” Finally, migrant essential workers are mentally exhausted. As one participant said, “part of being healthy is being in the state of mind where you don't have to worry about getting hurt.”His role as an essential worker did not always provide the space for this to be taken into account. Another added: ""I wish people knew that even though we made ourselves a priority, things felt harder than ever.""And they're not alone in this feeling. A recent study from the American Psychological Association found that essential workers in multiple industries are burned out. One of our participants said: ""Because you are considered an essential worker, then you are needed. And because you are needed, you are expected to show up under any circumstances.""This can affect mental health; This participant pushed his political representatives to “really look at the community they are serving and not politicize our lives because a lot of politics really has nothing to do with what we are going through.” Without a doubt, essential workers born in the United States work in a variety of industries. They also have extensive work experiences in each of these industries. Many of them may feel mentally exhausted and burned out by the inequalities of capitalism. And depending on their position, they might also have experienced health inequalities during the pandemic. However, migrant workers often face legal precariousness and/or long-distance family separation in addition to these factors, which can serve as additional stressors in their professional and personal lives. Many migrant essential workers are being worked to the bone as they face the disadvantages of being migrants in the United States, while being stereotyped by some as not contributing to the American workforce. As a community, we must come together to listen and learn about the diversity of experiences of migrant essential workers during the pandemic. It is our duty to be patient and understanding of the challenges they face, and we must support meaningful organizing efforts, such as the Workers' Justice Project, and policy changes, such as the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act, that could ensure greater security for migrant essential workers in California and across the country.

la-vista,Vacaciones: proceda con precaución,Vacation: Proceed with Caution,"Written by: Reese Colbentz Translated by: Jaynar De la Cruz Ochoa Esmé Puzio / Daily Nexus As many are returning from spring break, it has become evident that my classmates have already begun planning their summer vacations. However, even with the abundance of travel and vacations right now, it is important that we continue to practice keeping ourselves and others safe from the coronavirus. Although the severity of COVID-19 is slowly becoming a thing of the past, we are still actively living amid mask and vaccine protocols and are just recovering from the peak of the omicron variant. The omicron variant created a surge in cases in the winter, most pressing in the months of December and January, when it accounted for approximately 99.2% of COVID-19 infections. It is important to recognize that COVID-19 is still categorized as an international phenomenon with lasting effects on the world, even more so in certain nations. Many countries are still facing difficulties and adversities since the beginning of the outbreak in 2020 and, as a result, are really struggling to recover. For example, the economies of Russia, Pakistan, Poland, Peru, and many more, are grappling with the reality of limited access to healthcare infrastructure, closure of educational institutions, job losses, and minimal availability of vaccines and antigen tests for COVID-19. Hong Kong is currently facing its worst outbreak of cases, with a rising number of cases recorded. This outbreak is so serious that they have announced another mass lockdown and banned all travel in and out of the Chinese administration. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has been, and continues to be, an incessant problem for a large number of nations around the world. The flow of the omicron variant has followed a widely expected path, that is, the variant peaked in January and eased its way into a fairly unconcerning element of the COVID-19 battle once it had done its damage. While several variants of COVID-19 have come and gone, the most recent one to recognize is known as BA.2. This subvariant is supposedly 30% more transmissible than its predecessor, and researchers have realized that this subvariant can evade detection in current COVID-19 antigen tests, but this subvariant is the most promising form of the virus that could result in serious illness or hospitalization if you are not vaccinated. For those of you who have done your part to protect yourself and others around you by getting vaccinated, this new subvariant should not be a cause of stress! I am simply bringing them to your attention so that as citizens of our society, we can be diligent and aware of how this pandemic is evolving and likely approaching a state of insignificance. In terms of how this may affect travel plans, I would confidently recommend that rigorous research and planning is the most effective way to be safe and cautious. I think it is only responsible that we are aware of the COVID-19 trends around the world and the severity of which they have affected different nations. However, there are many places around the world that are ready for you to make your vacation debut. If you plan to travel within the United States, most states are looking at new protocols in an attempt to achieve a full reopening status. You can do your own research for the specific state you intend to travel to, but in general, people over the age of 2 should still wear masks indoors, despite vaccination status. Additionally, one is still required to wear a mask while traveling by plane, but we may be told otherwise on April 18 as there may be a further lifting of mandates for public transportation. Stay tuned! For those of you who already have your plans in place, keep these five tips from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in mind so you can enjoy your vacation safely and worry-free! First, the CDC recommends that you stay up to date on your vaccines, which means either get fully vaccinated or commit to getting your booster shot. Additionally, they encourage getting all vaccinations required by the country you plan to vacation in, to ensure protection against all possible diseases you might encounter abroad. Second, do your research and check the travel requirements of the place you want to visit. The CDC offers generators that show the severity level of COVID-19 in each nation. Be diligent in verifying that you are not planning to go to a highly infectious area at this time. Third, talk to your healthcare provider to get the best understanding of the illnesses you may encounter on your trip and to assess your vulnerability to such ailments. Fourth, expect the unexpected! We are living in unprecedented times, so we must learn to be flexible if plans evolve at a moment's notice. So, do what you can to protect yourself, such as purchasing travel insurance or being prepared with health care information in case you need medical care while traveling. Lastly, protect yourself and your loved ones! Please follow current COVID-19 protocols, wear your mask, wash your hands, and make smart choices so you can be happy, healthy, and enjoy your trip! I want to reiterate that I fully support you in any adventure you plan. As long as you are safe, practice healthy and responsible habits, and educate yourself about COVID-19, you will have a great time! Reese Coblentz aims to inform you about the current COVID-19 statistics and occurrences that society should be aware of and how this may influence your future vacation plans."

As they look to their campaign platforms, we ask our elected officials to tell us about their successes and shortcomings during their terms in positions of power. The term under review for the other executives “”President, EVPSA and EVPLA”” can be seen on dailynexus.com. Internal Vice President Bee Schaefer was not available for the term interview under review. External Vice President for State Affairs Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan served with extreme impact and productive commitment to the needs of the student body during the 2021-22 term. Quintero-Cubillan worked to put another platform point “”implementing a safe return to in-person instruction”” they say amid the lack of planning on the part of the university administration. Courtesy of Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan. Quintero-Cubillan, a fifth-year sociology student “” who simultaneously served the University of California Student Association (UCSA) as president during his tenure “” went above and beyond in his duties as External Vice President for State Affairs (EVPSA) and the president of UCSA to advocate for all students, specifically marginalized communities, through lobbying at the legislative, administrative, and student body levels. They worked on a campaign to double the Pell Grant, the largest federal grant for public college students across the nation, and increase the maximum award by more than $2,000. Additionally, they proposed an increase of $6 million for youth within foster care programs in the UC system in the preliminary California state budget. Both political initiatives have been included in the proposal for the next federal and state budget, respectively. The identity of a marginalized person in an institution “that is not built for [them]” was at the forefront of their espoused efforts consistent with both EVPSA and the president of UCSA. ""We are fighting to secure more financial support for our community, but the reason we have $6 million is because I am a former foster youth who went to UCSA and demanded it be included in our portfolio,"" Quintero-Cubillan said. ""We went to the governor's office and the governor's office included [that] in their initial draft of the state budget."" At UCSB, Quintero-Cubillan used the EVSPA budget to allocate $10,000 for basic needs for undocumented students and they fought for an increase in the budget for undocumented student services through the UC system. They also worked to find ""legislative champions"" for a variety of progressive and advocacy-based bills, including AB 367, a menstrual equity bill that provides free menstrual products at all public learning institutions. in California. Quintero-Cubillan also advocates for SB 118 “” which changes how California’s environmental law applies to colleges and saved UC Berkeley from cutting nearly 400 admitted students “” among a plethora of others “There are many things we did. Legislatively, there are actually tangible political things that have changed,"" Quintero-Cubillan said, reflecting his desire for more students to be aware of his office's advocacy. Quintero-Cubillan originally ran for EVPSA on a platform of fighting against tuition increases, addressing basic needs like housing and food insecurity, announcing a safe transition back to in-person instruction, and advocating ethics and responsibility for the environment. UC regents did not vote to approve a multi-year tuition increase last July even though Quintero-Cubillan mobilized students across UC to protest the increase. However, their EVPSA and UCSA offices were able to implement several student-serving commitments toward the original plan, including a five-year reaffirmation vote and an increase in tuition assistance reimbursement. ""We were able to insert a five-year reaffirmation of the vote, meaning that instead of being an endless increase in custody, we can at least stop the gap measure to protect students,"" they say. ""We increased the amount of revenue that would be used on something called aid returns. Aid returns are money taken from tuition dollars and redistributed through scholarships and other forms of financial aid. That, I believe, is a massive victory, ""they said. Quintero-Cubillan worked to meet another platform point “by implementing a safe return to in-person instruction” amid a lack of planning by the university administration, they said. ""I was fucking fighting with the administration. I was fighting with Chancellor [Henry T.] Yang, I was fighting with the COVID-19 task force,"" they said. ""I was the only one who was legitimately screaming, demanding that they do something, because I was terrified [that] nothing would be planned."" ""But when we were fighting for this, we were able to get COVID restrictions that weren't enough but it was something to protect students. I think that was a political gain,"" Quintero-Cubillan continued. During this period, Quintero-Cubillan also advocated on behalf of the student body directly to university administrations on issues such as the Munger Hall dormitory design controversy. After touring the original model of Munger Hall with other UCSB student executives, Quintero-Cubillan went to the UC regents and UC President Michael V. Drake to inform them of the Munger Hall mental health crisis raised with the students. ""I said, 'You need this.' “This is a mental health crisis waiting, this is crazy, this is of little merit on the part of the UC,” says Quintero-Cubillan. Quintero-Cubillan's work also prioritizes a purpose of direct aid towards marginalized communities. In his capacity both EVPSA and the president of UCSA, have redistributed funds to a variety of identity-based organizations “I am in a place of institutional power. ""I'm in a place of having great influence, and I'm in a position I've never been in before,"" they say. ""How can I, as someone who considers myself radical, who considers myself leftist and anti-capitalist, to distribute these funds in ways that are meaningful, important, and help sustain the community on campus?"" ""At the end of the day, it's not my job to do that work on campus. I am only an external representative,"" Quintero-Cubillan continued. ""He represented us outside the realm of our campus. But because I have the privilege, I see it as my job to redistribute institutional funds."" Now, they have given more than $55,000 cumulatively to student groups, including the UCSB Nikkei Student Union and the Black Student Union, as well as a variety of ceremonies of cultural groups. “I fought tooth and nail to go [to UCSB],” Quintero-Cubillan said of her experience as a transfer student. “When I got here, people took a chance on me and I can't see any way. I can leave this position without giving back to my community. And this is the way I can give back to them."" As president of UCSA, which Quintero-Cubillan acknowledged as a position that was sometimes traumatizing and difficult, one where they often dealt with transmisogyny. They work to reinforce an advocacy structure in the organization and support organizational campaigns that uplift marginalized students. ""I have always seen two of the most important campaigns being Racial Justice NOW! and Acquire, also known as the two campaigns that have the most involvement of students of color and other marginalized identities,"" they say. ""That was me as president, emphasizing the importance of campaigns and something I'm still working toward."" Quintero-Cubillan is also working on achieving one of the platform points ""advocating for ethics and environmental responsibility"" as president of UCSA with establishing an ongoing UCSA campaign for environmental justice. The goal of the proposed campaign will be ""to begin a new chapter as UC students actively fighting climate change in the institutional system through the defense board of regents, through advocacy with [the office of the president of UC] and with advocacy from the broader UC network,"" they say. During his tenure as president, they also successfully obtained back pay for UCSA employees who were not compensated for their efforts and work alongside student regent Alexis Atsilvsgi Zaragoza to implement UC's Native American Opportunity Plan, which proposed free UC tuition to California members of federally recognized indigenous tribes. ""Quintero-Cubillan spoke emotionally about what they felt was one of their 'biggest blows' while in office: they couldn't stop creation. of the highly controversial Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), which is scheduled to be built on the sacred land of Mauna Kea Native Hawaiians, during a meeting with UC President Drake. ""I told him, 'This project is genocide of an entire group of indigenous people. I am pleading, please don't do this, as an indigenous student and as someone whose tribe was in first contact with colonization before anyone else, please don't do this to us. Please don't kill another indigenous group,"" they say. TMT is continuing to move forward with the project, as UC continues to invest in the effort annually and is currently seeking funding for its project. ""I was thinking about going to the meeting , if anyone can persuade you, it would be me because I spent these past two years learning how to talk to people. Learning how to speak in a way that makes people care about what we have to say. And that still wasn't enough—I'm sorry that I failed in my promise to my community,"" Quintero-Cubillan continued. He also said they wished they had communicated more clearly with the student body about several legislative gains and direct advocacy they achieved during their tenure. “I wish there was more publicity in the way we win and fight for the people,” says Quintero-Cubillan. “I wish we had made more efforts to convey how representative our office is and how we truly serve you.” “Quintero-Cubillan. believes that successor Marvia Cunanan, who is currently serving as the director of campus organizing in the EVPSA office, will bring a similar perspective of empathy and empowerment to marginalized communities on campus, with a focus on disability justice. ""Marvia is the future,"" they say. ""I think she was honest in a way that enhanced how I ran [for office], and she will still embody the ideas of fairness, care and justice."" During her time in office, it is clear that the work of A place of empathy and lived experience remains central to Quintero-Cubillan's passion for empowering and advocating for marginalized communities, the structure and mission of the EVPSA office, which they reformed to ensure safety and well-being for the majority. QRBIPOC employees “” to the time they spent advocating for marginalized students seeking help. ""What keeps me going and what empowers me is thinking about how my ancestors fought for me to be here and how I am a direct product of resilience, their care and their love, this has always sustained me,"" said Quintero-Cubillan . ""It's important to me that marginalized students on campus look at someone like me, look at someone like them, fighting for them and understanding, fundamentally, that I'm here for them. I'm here because they took a risk for me and I I'm going to give it all back to them."" A version of this article appeared on page 4 of the May 5 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

It is a six-month pilot project that will provide access to sanitary pads, including tampons, in the building's nine bathrooms. Menstrual products are located in four neutral bathrooms on the first and second floors, as well as in the women's bathroom on the fourth floor. Esmé Puzo/ Daily Nexus Menstrual products will be available in dispensers in 4 neutral bathrooms on the first and second floors of the library, and in one in the ladies' bathroom on the fourth floor. The Associated Students Commission on Student Welfare (COSWB) is a commission dedicated to the well-being of UCSB's undergraduate population with an emphasis on physical, nutritional and mental well-being, according to its website. Their newest project attempts to address poverty associated with menstruation ""“ defined as the lack of access to one's own menstrual products by any individual who needs it ""“ according to COSWB publicity coordinator Emily Zomoroudi. ""The goal is to combat period poverty, or the lack of access to menstrual products for people who do not have sufficient funds to pay for them,"" Zomoroudi said in a statement to the Nexus. The project is a renewed version of the ""Period Project"" that COSWB launched in 2021 in collaboration with the UCSB Period chapter, which is a community organization that works to combat and educate the community about period poverty. COSWB is also distributing menstrual products to the Isla Vista community at Pizza My Heart, Woodstock ""˜s Pizza and Rock Fire Grill in conjunction with the library. A junior in the biology department and Womxn""™ coordinator COSWB Health Michelle Tu spoke about the need to give all students equal access to menstrual products. ""It's important to have these products available because a period is not something you can control,"" said Tu. ""I think it's important to recognize the needs of students. Having menstrual cramps [and] while trying to find a menstrual product is stressful, so something that can relieve students' stress while they attend to their studies is quite important too. The pilot project of Six months will serve as a launching pad to implement distribution permanently across the UCSB campus, according to Tu. Additionally, she said COSWB hopes to expand the program ""We put it into six months because, hopefully, we would love to implement this as something permanent,"" said Tu. “Hopefully we can also provide menstrual products that are reusable to have a sustainable solution in the future.” Providing long-term reusable products coincides with COSWB's long-term goals of ensuring a reduced carbon footprint, he said. Tu. “I think providing more menstrual products that are reusable [is a more permanent solution],”said Tu. “Reducing environmental impact is also one of our big goals.” “There's a big stigma behind [menstrual products]. reusable] too."" she continued. ""I think trying to educate people about other sustainable solutions, compared to single-use products, is also one of our goals."" The products will be restocked by COSWB by volunteers who are students. Students can notify COSWB if necessary following a QR code that is posted on each dispenser. Tu said giving students an opportunity to volunteer to help resupply,"" Tu said. ""I think it's a good way to incorporate the student population into the community. I think it provides a connection between how students can be more involved on campus and help by volunteering as well."" This project has been months in the making, as Tu said, it was originally planned to take place before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 “We started the spring quarter [officially] but because the pandemic happened, we just shipped [the products] to off-campus locations,” Tu said Tu emphasized that period poverty is not an issue. It not only affects the UCSB campus community, but also all parts of a student's health. “Period poverty affects all parts of a student's well-being,” said Tu. and recognize that not everyone can afford them.” Tu said community feedback on the project has already been positive and said she hopes to continue the pilot project and expand the mission of creating greater accessibility to menstrual supplies. ""I remember people saying [the products] were a lifesaver, and I felt like my work putting this together was rewarding,"" Tu said. ""It's really about helping people in the moment and being able to relieve some of the stress that people have. I'm super grateful to be able to do that."""

Mark Alfred / Daily Nexus Mark Alfred / Daily Nexus The three unions representing various California University employees are in the process of renegotiating contracts and labor to leverage the combined more than 48,000 members to obtain concessions. the university on this issue including affordable housing, wages and child care. Members from all three unions gathered on campuses across UC to coordinate a march, advocating for fair wages and workplace policy. The largest protest. took place at UC San Diego, UC Berkeley and UC Los Angeles where supporters blocked the streets in their march and were encountered by police in SWAT gear. At UC Santa Barbara, members and supporters gathered outside Cheadle Hall, where individuals gave a speech before the group marched to Henry T. Yang's fifth-floor office. PhD student researcher in biomolecular science and engineering Payton DeMarzo said she wants to focus on discrimination protection. ""We shouldn't have to endure this toxicity because we're afraid of being moved out of the lab and having to start the thesis all over again,"" she says. ""We should not be penalized for the actions of the perpetrator, and that is one thing that matters a lot to me."" ""We are making them listen to us by coming out and teaching them that this is something we are not going to give up. Humanitarian rights cannot be negotiate,"" continues DeMarzo. PhD candidate in molecular biology and member of the Student Researchers United (SRU) Katherine Dickson led the group in a series of chants, reciting, ""48,000 ready to fight, postdocs, ARs, grads, united.""

Plunkett said the union has waited more than half an hour for him to arrive. the representative for the university, only to present a package identical to the one they presented six months ago. ""The university presented a compensation package six months ago, without changes, instead of talking about how they are going to pay us enough to live and work in the community,"" he says. ""There is talk of how an altered pay schedule will somehow magically address the problem of millions of dollars being stolen from the pockets of postdocs through back and delayed salaries."" In negotiations beginning with SRU, the university has stated that they ""are committed to ensuring that [union members] are fairly compensated for [their] work,"" as well as ""ensuring a work environment for all employees is safe, respectful and supportive."" Robert McLaughlin , a doctoral student researcher in computer science, said that, while many UC employees are members of different unions, they share similar struggles, including the burden of high income and the need for child care. ""So, we are specifically asking for a joint negotiating table for these issues. But the UC has really rejected this,"" he says. After the speech, members of the three unions wrote personal, unsigned messages advocating for the unions' goals on a poster addressed to Yang that read, ""Can you tell who is who?"" The group eventually made their way to the fifth floor of Cheadle. Hall, taping the poster over the chancellor's office door and posing for photos.

This exchange is one of many details revealed via email from Yang's office between June and September 2021 of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project. Partially funded by the University of California, the project is an effort to build. a scientific telescope on the big island of Hawaii. UC students and activists are protesting the project, which is located on Mauna Kea, sacred land for indigenous Hawaiians. UC has kept most of the details and its annual contributions to the project a secret. For years, TMT has been mired in controversy, delays and funding shortfalls.

The Nexus filed the California Public Records Act with the Office of the President of the University of California on July 31, 2021 and receives documents and emails from that month request. Yang's responsibilities as president of TMT are poorly explained on the TMT website, through documents received by the Nexus he indicated involvement and authority. The documents also show that UC has invested $73,114,382 in the project since December 2020. TMT board members have avoided public discussion about the project, revealed through emails from Yang's office. CEO of Canada's National Research Council Luc Simard, who is a member of TMT's board of directors, planned to speak about TMT at the Hawaii executive conference this January. However, Simard raised concerns with the visibility of the conversation via email.

""Most native women will face violence at the age of 18 and I faced violence at the age of 15. Specifically at the intersection of being gender nonconforming, trans native and a [feminine] person I always expected that my expectation of life would be 32 years"""", they said. ""If you are black or indigenous and you are trans or two-spirit, the probability that you will see beyond 35 years is slim, extremely slim"" ""I have lived my life believing. that I will disappear from this earth and be stolen from my family, from my community, from my friends at that age. And every year when my birthday passed, it never seemed like a time of celebration; ""I always felt like I was approaching the day of my death,"" Quintero-Cubillan continued. Quintero-Cubillan said that this fear as an indigenous and queer individual instilled in them the need to raise awareness about murders, kidnappings and violence against women, girls and peoples. two-spirit indigenous people to ensure that life can be celebrated with joy, without fear of violence. Together with the First Peoples in the Diaspora Collective, the American Indian and Indigenous Cultural Resource Center and the protectors of Mauna Kea, the Office of the External Vice President for State Affairs of Quintero-Cubillan held an awareness campaign on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People (MMIWG2S) event through a death on May 5, a day of national celebration in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day. About 40 people participated in the ""die-in,"" a demonstration where people gather and lie on the ground as if they were dead, mid-morning at the Arbor. . Cameran Bahnsen, a fifth-year environmental studies student and mentor for the American Indian and Indian Cultural Resource Center, said MMIWG2S Day is an opportunity to bring the discussion about violence against Indigenous communities to the forefront of the national conversation. “I think Indigenous communities and issues are often overlooked, so MMIWG2S Day is a way to bring visibility to what affects us as Indigenous people,” Bahnsen said. ""We have faced violence since the Europeans arrived, and now we continue to face violence for a variety of reasons."" Bahnsen said that because UCSB is a land-grant university, a university built on indigenous lands, it is imperative that students understand the violence perpetrated against the Chumash people in order to create the university. “Land-grant universities were formed on the basis of the violent removal of indigenous people from their lands,” Bahnsen said. ""All of us who attend UCSB and other schools in the UC system benefit from that violent history because we can be here and we can go to school and receive education on the ancestral lands of indigenous people like our Chumash relatives."" . ""Highlighting Indigenous communities, Indigenous voices, and Indigenous issues is crucial for us because we benefit from that system,"" he continued. The death began with a circle of intentions among event organizers to talk about why they chose to be present during the demonstration. Reflecting on the event, Quintero-Cubillan said they offered their traditional medicine to those in the circle during the discussion of intentions. “This is my abalone shell and I filled it with our sacred herbs,” said Quintero-Cubillan, showing a shell filled with tobacco, mugwort and sage. ""When we talk about medicine, we talk about our sacred herbs that are meant to heal us, free us, and provide a sense of common connection"". Protesters at the event stood on the ground in front of the Arbor at UC Santa Barbara to show solidarity and support for the indigenous community, physically blocking witnesses from passing by without acknowledging the participants. ""It's really easy to turn off the rest of the world and its problems because we become self-consumed with our own,"" Quintero-Cubillan said. ""Seeing the community stand up and raise our voices, it's a way of forcing us to pay attention, because how else are you going to hear it unless you're already involved or someone brings it to you directly?"" Then, the organizers and assistants created a banner, painting their hands red and gluing them to the paper. ""This is a collective banner of all of us putting our footprints because the red footprint is a symbol of an MMIW movement,"" Quintero-Cubillan said. ""I also wanted us to create something together to show that we are united, to show that it's not just about the natives. It's our allies, it's everyone in the community who is showing that they care."" The event ended with Quintero-Cubillan, Bahnsen and the doctoral candidate in feminist studies and advisor to the Collective of Native Peoples in the Diaspora Nancy Morales speaking about the importance of May 5 and their respective organizations. ""Then our Chumash relatives gave us some songs, and after they sang, we got together, did a lot of hugs, a lot of care work, and we were done,"" said Quintero-Cubillan. Quintero-Cubillan spoke about why the group decided to organize a death event to spread the word about MMIWG2S this year. ""The deaths are really effective because it's a way to force people to interrupt their daily lives and pay attention to the death and violence against the community,"" Quintero-Cubillan said, noting that community reactions were mixed. . “I noticed a lot of people and we had a lot of people around us,” Quintero-Cubillan said. ""We also had a teacher who threatened to call the police because his students were taking a midterm, and our response was, 'Your midterm is not worth our lives, a midterm is not worth a complete genocide.'"" During last year's MMIWG2S Day, Indigenous student organizations honored the day of celebration through other methods such as presentations. However, Morales said the decision to make this year's awareness event a die-in was to send a physically disruptive message to the campus community about the seriousness of the problem. ""Death makes a stronger message to really make people feel uncomfortable and provide some visibility on campus,"" Morales said. ""It's to create some kind of momentum, so whether some people were upset or not, if they were, that was the goal: to create discomfort and disruption on campus."" She said conversations about MMIWG2S cannot stop after a single day of awareness because the issue is a daily struggle for Indigenous communities. Regardless, Morales was grateful for the community's participation and support during the death. Morales pointed out that ""May 5 is not just a one-day event, we don't just come on this day to do this, but it is an everyday fight."" ""I am very grateful for all the students and people who participated that day,"" Morales continued. ""It was an honor and a privilege to be there with them to create the space together."" Quintero-Cubillan spoke about the importance of MMIWG2S day as a native two-spirit individual. ""I have many identities: I'm queer, I'm two-spirit, I'm Native, those are some of my main identities,"" they said. ""I have been personally impacted by the crisis. As a trans and two-spirit person, I have faced physical, emotional, social and colonial violence; [throughout] my entire existence as a person, I have faced violence."" “I want people to see and hear what it feels like to be legitimately forced to pay attention to us,” Quintero-Cubillan said. ""I am dying, and I am dying in silence. I am dying in silence and I will disappear from this world if this crisis continues and I refuse to die in silence"". Furthermore, Quintero-Cubillan emphasized that the world does not need to know these violence statistics to care for the indigenous community. ""90% of Native women will face violence, but you don't need to know that statistic to worry because, at the end of the day, we are human,"" they said. ""If you care about the future of humanity, you will care about indigenous peoples because we protect more than 80% of this world's biodiversity, but we are 5% of the world's population"". “When you fight for indigenous peoples, you are fighting for your planet and you are fighting for our collective future,” said Quintero-Cubillan. ""Please don't wait until we die to finally care about the movement because there will come a day when I may get lost in the violence, and I don't want that to be the reason people start to care."" .

The announcement came after members of the Associated Students (A.S.) organizations expressed surprise and confusion that their budgets had been reduced to zero for next year with the expectation. The Senate ultimately voted to extend the application deadline for reinvestment funds to accommodate entities that were not informed of the upcoming budget cuts. The Senate budget for the 2021-22 academic year was $13,689,460.91 and the incoming budget will be approved in the coming weeks, Third year political science and sociology double major, current Senator of Letters and Sciences and Chair of Finance and Business (F&B ) Committee Hailey Stankiewicz said during the public forum. Stankiewicz said the Food and Beverage Committee cut this year's overfunded entities' budgets to zero in hopes they will apply to keep the money, known as rollover funds, for next year. Entities that were eliminated included Collaborative Black Women's Health Center (BWHC), A.S. Book Bank, Disability Equality Commission, Public Safety Commission, UCIV, Environmental Justice Alliance, A.S. Food Bank, Human Rights Board, A.S. Public and Mental Health Commission, Students Against Sexual Assault, and Transfer Student Alliance. ""We didn't want the organizations that didn't have transfers to be left with nothing and have no budget to work with, so we looked at the organizations that did have transfers in the hope that they requested the transfer,"" Stankiewicz said. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors that led to the current budget decrease, the Food and Beverage Committee faced difficult decisions about which entities to provide reduced funds to, according to Stankiewicz. However, several A.S. Entities, including BWHC and TSA, told the Senate during a public forum that they were not aware that their budgets were being reduced to zero or that they were expected to request their transfer of funds to fund their organizations for the 2022-23 year. Halle Dawite, BWHC co-president and fourth-year sociology student, criticized A.S. for their lack of communication in their decision to reduce the organizations' budgets to zero. “I am very confused as to why I found out an hour ago from another co-chair that my budget will be reduced to zero dollars next year,” Dawite said. ""The budget was only sent to like, five different co-presidents [from different organizations] whose budgets were significantly reduced, and then one of those co-presidents who is a friend of mine sent me the budget and said, 'Do it.' Do you know you have zero dollars next year?""™"" ""[The school food bank] has been cut, [Trans and Queer Commission] has been cut. I'm very confused about where the transparency is, because Why hasn't anyone told me what's going on? She continued. Stankiewicz said she didn't know it was under the jurisdiction of the Food and Beverage Committee to inform the organizations about the proposed budget cuts and tell them that they will request transfer of funds. and I, Adam Majcher, didn't realize that we were required to let everyone know who was at zero,"" he said. ""We recommend that these entities apply for rollover because rollover was considered when we considered what to zero out."" Stankiewicz said it would be communicated promptly to the entities expected to use its transferred funds. Monica Sassounian, a fourth-year sociology student, co-president of TSA, also expressed the same experience as Dawite and asked for more communication from A.S. to Boards, Committees and Units (BCU), a task that corresponds to the Senators. ""We also didn't know about the budget until our advisor sent it to us. I think there definitely needs to be more transparency,"" Sassounian said. Sassounian said that when TSA requested $80,000 for its budget, the organization only received $16,000 without any explanation of the budget rollover and reduction process. ""A.S. needs to do more to keep us involved, and A.S. needs to be more representative of its BCUs"". A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 12, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus."
la-vista,"Salud y Bienestar de UCSB acoge ""hablemos: imagen del cuerpo masculino en UCSB""","UCSB Health and Wellness Hosts ""Let's Talk: Male Body Image at UCSB""","Written by: Melea Maglalang Translated by: Mariana Benítez Arreola Health and Wellness at UC Santa Barbara had a community discussion event titled “Let's Talk: Male Body Image at UCSB” on May 5 in the women's center lounge, inviting students to learn about stigmas around normalizations of the male body and how to support male-identifying individuals fighting a certain body image. The event began with a screening of an episode of ""Enough Man,"" a television series that follows conversations between Hollywood actors discussing what it means to be a man today. Esmé Puzio / Daily Nexus After the episode, attendees shared their thoughts about the difficulties in talking about body image and how their experiences aligned with what they saw in the episode. Fourth-year cell and developmental biology student Odin Dalio works for Health and Wellness at UCSB as a health promotion intern specializing in male body image and men's eating disorders. He says the purpose of the event is to encourage conversations around body image by providing a welcome space for people to share perspectives on the issue. ""What we really wanted to do was just get men and women talking about male body image, eating disorders and things like that, just allowing a space where people can have conversations about these things,"" says Dalio. ""Because really, in our society, it's not something that many people talk about openly, much less know [that] it's a problem."" According to Dalio, body image is generally marked as a woman's problem, and many conversations around of body image focus on women. He says this problem is just as common among men, but conversations can be difficult to have because they require expressing vulnerability, which can be perceived negatively by men. ""[Body image] is generally known as a women's issue,"" a lot of people don't know that it's definitely a problem among men as well,"" says Dalio. ""It's genuinely difficult for men to open up about this issue [of body image]. of the body] because when you talk about this, you have to put yourself in a vulnerable spot, which [is] associated with weakness and weakness is bad."" ""You have this box that all men have to put inside, and you have to be strong all the time when, in reality, it's hard to be strong all the time,"" the continuum. Health and wellness health education specialist Joanna Hill says they made efforts in the past to encourage conversations from the male-identifying student body , but they were often met with resistance from those in attendance. ""[Health and Wellness] had big workshops for large groups of men, and it just wasn't good because the words weren't there. They were like, ""What are you talking about?"" This is normal,"" she says. ""Sometimes I'm the first person they hear it from."" Hill reiterated this sentiment, saying that an intrinsic awareness of the ""Fifteen to 22 is about the range that is much, much more likely to have an eating disorder. Your body is going through all these changes,"" she says. ""Some of these changes are praised by society, networks, etc. So, it's a pretty vulnerable time in your life."" Dalio says that society perceives the ideal male body as an image of an individual ""toned"" and ""having a lot of muscle"" and bodies outside the standard of being healthy, a misconception that he argues against at the event. Providing support for those who are struggling with their own body image can start with having discussions, such as with the community event or with introducing the topic to friends in a safe and welcoming environment, depending on Dalio. ""If one person is having a meaningful conversation with another person about these issues, especially their female-identifying people talking openly and vulnerably and honestly about it, then maybe those two people could be talking openly and vulnerably with two other friends. -in-one, because it's hard to get a lot of people to change everything at once,"" says Dalio. Hill reflected on the community discussion event as an important first step in introducing healthy body image conversations for students male-identifying students on campus, especially having female-identifying students trending as well to facilitate discussion. ""[Talking about] male body image is very difficult. There's a lot of resistance. It's a tough topic, and women are well versed in this,"" says Hill. ""I'm thinking of all the different ways to attract men to this conversation and that is discussing body image with women, introducing the idea of ​​having conversations with the men who are in your life and who matter to you."" Dalio added that having these conversations with people around you can help bring about community change and normalize these discussions and provide support for each other. ""Some kind of social movement builds from [having conversations with each other], then all these people can start jumping in, and then that's when you get community change,"" he says.

MKP UCSB will give public and written testimony to the UC Board of Regents at its next meeting on May 18 against the TMT project. Sydney Haupt / Daily Nexus The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project is a partially UC-funded effort to build a large scientific telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea, sacred land to Native Hawaiians, for astronomy purposes. Student groups, including the Mauna Kea Protectors, have protested the project, an effort led by Chancellor Henry T. Yang, since Mauna Kea was chosen as the preferred site for the telescope in 2009. Mauna Kea Protectors(MKP) UCSB It was established approximately between 2017 and 2018 in light of the construction of the telescope. “There were a lot of protectors blocking construction on Mauna Kea in 2019 and that's when about 33 elders were arrested on top of there,” said Honu Nichols, fourth-year political science student and president of MKP UCSB, a Hawaii native. Currently, MKP UCSB will give public and written testimony to the UC Board of Regents at its next meeting on May 18 against the TMT project. ""Our main action is to try to get as many people to use their voice directly to the regents who, at the end of the day, make these decisions about whether this project happens or not,"" Nichols said. ""The main reason we are doing this is not just to put it on their radar, but we want them to publicly denounce and get rid of the Thirty Meter Telescope, so our main focus is to target the regents, [the president of UC Michael V .] Drake and Yang directly through letters and phone comments"". Much of MKP UCSB's divestment activism stalled due to the pandemic, forcing the organization to work remotely until this spring quarter. “There was a lot of movement that stopped quickly due to the pandemic, but UC Divest TMT didn't stop there. We just moved remotely, but a lot of our in-person actions were obviously on hold,” Nichols said. ""It wasn't until this spring quarter that we were able to communicate and build in-person capacity on the UCSB campus, and that's where we started to get a lot of our movement going."" MKP UCSB's top priority is protecting Native Hawaiian sacred land and elevating the voices of indigenous peoples, Nichols said. ""This project has opened up a really special opportunity for people to understand indigenous peoples, and their sovereignty and consent to that land is actually a legitimate concern because of the illegal occupation [of] Hawaii by the United States"" , said. MKP UCSB recently held an event on May 11 on the lagoon lawn at UCen to raise awareness about Mauna Kea and to call for student activism at UCSB regarding the TMT project. The event featured live music, ceremony, food and a panel on the Sacred Public Commentary and Poetry Workshop, ending the day with the screening of the short film ""Hawaiian Soul"" at the multicultural center. “I wanted to make sure [the event] was deeply rooted in ancestral teachings and kÅ«puna and that it asked permission and consent from the Chumash natives of the lands on which our university resides,” Nichols said. The event began in protocol, which works to properly begin and open spaces with the permission of indigenous peoples to enter their land, where members of the Chumash peoples came and welcomed MKP UCSB as guests on their land. ""We had the tribal chairman and some other Chumash people come and welcome us into protocol,"" Nichols said. ""We share songs and prayers with them, asking their permission, saying that we are guests in this land and that we ask to be welcome in their land."" This protocol process ended with attendees forming a line, meaning MKP UCSB was officially welcomed to the land. Nichols spoke of this ceremony stating why the TMT project violates the consent process that is fundamental to indigenous peoples and their lands. ""Consent was given [during the event], which is a very important part of why TMT is not okay, because they are not addressing people's consent,"" he said. ""The protocol not only asked for permission, but it also asked for guidance from our ancestors and these chants that we were doing were asking for divine knowledge and calling them into the space just to make it a sacred space"". The panel that followed during the event addressed issues of settler colonialism and its lasting impacts for the Chumash people. Panelists also discussed the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People movement and the importance of UC's involvement with TMT. Nichols said the event presented an opportunity for Indigenous people to come together as a community. ""I wanted the event to not only be a sacred space, but a safe space for indigenous people to speak openly about their concerns, their struggles and know that they are not alone,"" they said. Nichols added that the event provided space to bring intersectional marginalized voices to the forefront. “Having mostly women and queer women on that panel also gives people [the opportunity] to recognize the people on the panel who are part of this movement and see that in themselves,” she said. ""I want to encourage Indigenous students by creating a space, giving them a platform to use their voice in community with other Indigenous students."" Nichols spoke about the importance of MKP UCSB's existence on the UCSB campus due to the university's extensive involvement in the TMT project. “It is vital that MKP engages and mobilizes people on the UCSB campus because UCSB is the home base in terms of UC Divest TMT,” they said. ""Chancellor Yang serves on the board of governors as chair of this project, so we have a really special opportunity on the UCSB campus to hold our chancellor, our administration, and all of UC as a whole accountable for their decisions and where they are providing our money."" Nichols said she has a personal stake in the TMT project as a Native Hawaiian and a responsibility to her people back home to ensure Mauna Kea's sacred land is protected. ""I have a very deep responsibility to my people and my community at home to take advantage of this opportunity while I am abroad, trying to obtain a higher education,"" he said. ""I want to use the little time I have because I am a transfer student to use my voice and advocate for my people and get justice before I return home."""
la-vista,UC Santa Barbara planea cerrar la clí­nica dental del campus,UC Santa Barbara plans to close campus dental clinic,"Written by: Mark Alfred and Nisha Malley Translated by: Jaynar de la Cruz Ochoa UC Santa Barbara Student Health Services will close its Dental Care Center, the only clinic on campus that offers dental services to all graduate and undergraduate students with care from the UC Student Health Insurance Plan, by June 30, citing financial considerations, insufficient clinic utilization and a shift to invest resources in other medical services. Libby Holmes / Daily Nexus The dental clinic offers dental cleanings, dental x-rays, cancer screenings, fillings and emergency services, according to the Student Health Service (SHS) website. With the return to in-person learning for the fall quarter of 2021, the dental clinic announced that it had ""resumped all dental services, including restorative and surgical treatments,"" the website reads. The closure has been in the works for more than a year, according to SHS CEO Dr. Vejas Skripkus. At that time, the university did not consult with the student population about the clinic's closure or inform them of the clinic's planned closure, according to Skripkus. The university also did not notify dental clinic staff of the closure and only discussed the decision with staff supervisors, Skripkus said at a meeting held with the United Students Labor Action Coalition (USLAC) on March 6. May. Skripkus apologized for the university's handling of the decision during a May 18 Zoom meeting with members of USLAC, United Auto Workers 2865, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and dental clinic staff. Information about the closure was released by USLAC, a network of university organizations that support labor and worker rights. USLAC circulated a petition to signal support for the dental clinic in an effort to prevent its closure and reached 147 signatures as of May 17, according to USLAC. ""The communication of this change was insufficient and we apologize, myself and everyone here on the call, for the confusion and concern this process has caused. We recognize that this change could have been communicated much more effectively"", Skripkus said at the May 18 meeting. ""This change was carefully considered with concern for the students and staff involved. We regret that the communication did not meet expectations and we take this lesson very seriously,"" he continued. UCSB has not made an official university-wide announcement about the clinic's closure. Skripkus said UCSB expects private clinics in the area to absorb the Dental Care Center's patient load. “There are several dental offices around campus that are accepting applications for the UCSB Delta Dental PPO plan,” Skripkus said. ""So, the volume of our dental clinic will not overwhelm the local market, as our operation has only involved a single full-time dentist for quite some time, who recently left for another organization."" During the May 18 meeting, community members expressed concerns about student access to essential and affordable health services, potential layoffs due to the clinic closure, and lack of communication from the university about the decision. According to the university, UCSB SHS conducted periodic evaluations of the dental clinic's utilization, financial stability and services offered, information that guided the decision behind the clinic's closure. UCSB Media Relations Manager Kiki Reyes specifically cited declining use of the clinic's services by the student body. ""With declining utilization numbers seen at the dental care facility in recent years, consultation began with the SHS governing body and student health advisory committee regarding dental options for UCSB students within the community,"" Reyes said in a statement. Skripkus said at the meeting that the dental clinic only accepts UC SHIP insurance, limiting its ability to serve UCSB students, more than half of whom are enrolled in a non-university insurance program. ""Given the large number of dental providers in the surrounding area who accept UC SHIP-sponsored Delta Dental insurance and can provide the same level of insurance benefit coverage for our students, SHS decided that the dental care center was not the service most beneficial they could provide,"" Reyes said in a statement. Students expressed concerns about wait times to book an appointment at private clinics in the area, as well as transportation issues that could arise from not having access to an on-campus facility. “We are committed to providing transportation assistance as we transition our dental clinic operations off campus,” Skripkus said in response. Skripkus said consideration of the clinic's long-term financial viability also factored into the decision, citing the need for ""extraordinarily expensive"" investments in the clinic's facilities if the university sought to keep it open. “Our dental clinic infrastructure is approaching need for renovation, and will be extraordinarily expensive, requiring additional space renovations, equipment and more,” Skripkus said at the May 18 meeting. UCSB dental hygienist Linda Metcalfe responded by questioning the need for substantial renovations at the meeting and said most of the equipment and facilities are in good working order. She said the only problem facing the dental clinic currently is the loss of its only full-time dentist, who abruptly left his position this year. ""Our clinic is doing well,"" Metcalfe said. ""We've been up and running and fully operational. The only problem is we lost our dentist. So, the demand is there, the equipment is there, the need is certainly there. It was just that our dentist left quite unexpectedly and left us in this hole."" Student activists are protesting the closing of the dental clinic because of the necessary on-campus services it provides to students, according to the petition. ""This is a decision that is not in the best interest of students, as it will force many people to seek help in Goleta and Santa Barbara instead of having a local clinic to solve their dental problems,"" the petition said. ""These private clinics have no guarantee that they will have the same expert care as our UC workers and no guarantee that they have any interest in the students' health beyond what their insurance can pay."" Kimberlee Keithley, a chemical engineering research student, expressed her personal frustration with the lack of communication from the university about the clinic closing. ""I just don't understand why there wasn't earlier communication at least a few months ago, so that people could schedule something off-campus and not have a six-month to a year delay in their dental cleanings,"" Keithley said at the meeting. . “This has been a difficult decision to make,” UCSB Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn said at the meeting. ""It's really about what we're seeing in terms of the services that students need to have on campus and what's available in the community."" Fourth-year history student Jarod Ramirez laid out USLAC's demands regarding the clinic, asking that the clinic remain open fully or at least through the summer. Metcalfe affirmed this, saying outgoing seniors tend to make appointments during the months of July and August and would benefit from an extension of the clinic's operations. ""Instead of making our closing date June 30, I think we could possibly push it to at least the end of August so we can take care of our seniors,"" Metcalfe said. ""Usually we would have that scheduled for July and August, and I feel bad. We're leaving them in the lurch with only two months left on their insurance and their lease."" Ramirez asked Skripkus directly if there was any chance they wouldn't close the clinic. “Any possible way for [the clinic] to stay open?” he asked. ""Jarod, right now, the answer is no to that,"" Skripkus responded. Skripkus said the clinic's closure cannot be delayed, as UCSB's pharmacy expansion work will begin with the closure of the dental clinic. With the closure of the dental clinic, SHS is shifting its resources to invest in other medical services for students, expanding pharmacy, gynecology and sports medicine services, as well as hiring more primary care providers, according to Reyes. “While the future vision for student health is not an admission into dental specialties, it will provide outstanding, comprehensive primary medical care and behavioral health,” Skripkus said. Following the university's rejection of USLAC's initial demands to keep the clinic open, the organization plans to hold a rally on May 25 in front of the library in protest of the clinic's closure. Skripkus promised to respond to USLAC's closure requests within a week. A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 19, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus."
la-vista,Un estudio de caso: pasión versus beneficio,A case study: passion versus profit,"Written by: Amitha Bhat Translated by: Jaynar de la Cruz Ochoa You don't need to refer to your old mock trial notes for this because this is a classic case you won't forget. Will you dive headfirst into what you're truly passionate about, neglecting a safety net, or take the safe route with guaranteed financial stability? For many people, this debate begins with their future college major, but for others, it begins much earlier. Audrey Kenyon / Daily Nexus Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the immense privilege I already have. Having the option to pursue higher education is a gift in itself and is not something I take for granted. I understand that while the debate between passion and profit is a common experience, many people have no choice due to factors such as socioeconomic status and home life. That being said, I hope this article illuminates a collective experience that many students, like myself, go through. Ever since the concept of a college major had entered my consciousness, I had decided that mine would be English. My reasoning was simple: writing has always consumed my life, reading was my favorite activity, second only to writing, and English was my favorite school subject (you know, when everything was simplified into the four domains of English, history , mathematics and science). He had come up with a plan: In retrospect, it was a pretty expensive plan. At the time of devising this plan, I had reached the highly mature age of 12. And as a 12-year-old, it was my self-proclaimed responsibility to speak as loudly as possible about virtually everything. Then, when I repeatedly informed my father about my genius idea, he experienced something akin to heart palpitations. Let me tell you about my father. He grew up middle class and eventually immigrated to the United States from India. He's self-taught with cameras, a connoisseur of film and photography, an avid reader, and can outdo his resident ""˜film bro'"". These are all activities outside of your job as a program director. Ultimately, it embodies the classic immigrant story: the lived experience of working hard to get where you are. With the immigrant story comes the immigrant mentality: above all, your priority should be to support yourself financially. My father believed, in his bones, that it would be extremely difficult, almost impossible, to obtain financial security with a liberal arts degree. But I always wanted to star in my own movie ""Mission: Impossible."" As the years went by, I maintained that I would move forward with my plan. My dad dismissed me, treating my academic interest as a mere phase that he could turn into a hobby once he grew up. Honestly, I think he was just worried about me. He didn't want to see me struggle all my life, staggering to pay the rent. I didn't want to see myself fail, to see myself helpless, to be forced to reckon with the idea that I wasn't good enough to succeed in such a competitive field, one where to make enough money to live freely, you needed to be the best. He knew he'd seen people throw themselves headlong into their passion, only to watch them drown. But I also knew that I always was, and still am, incredibly passionate about writing – it's my entire life. I know there's nothing like the feeling I get when I'm stuck on a project, my mind moving with the cadence of my words. I know these things, but I often wondered if he ever did it. Combine their protective instinct with the mentality that ""tough love"" sets them straight, and you have a fight erupting every time you mention the word ""English."" Or, when my dad spontaneously says, “You know you're going to get an MBA, right?” This is the conversation, always. My father, representing profit: The humanities are already a dead field. Fewer and fewer people are earning liberal arts degrees. It is incredibly difficult to find a well-paying job with an English degree, and the limited well-paying jobs are highly competitive and require you to go through extensive education. [Insert family friend I've never met in my life] majored in liberal arts and are struggling to find a job! Do you want it to be you? I'll send you this article on how AI software can write articles better than most people, and soon your work will be obsolete! Or something like that. And sure, hearing it all right now may make sense, but will it make sense when my soul is dying from the inside out? I don't believe it. Myself, representing the passion: Humanities degrees are incredibly useful. They are a master class in reading, writing, critical thinking, content analysis and creativity. There are many opportunities for an English major, such as publishing, journalism, and even marketing! If in 10 years I make $200,000 at a job I hate, I'll curse myself for never trying to do what I love. My mother comes from a similar background to my father and as a result has a similar mindset. However, as the eternal peacemaker of the family, she sympathizes much more with my passion, which leaves her stuck in the middle more often than not. If these incessant shouting matches have taught me anything, it is that profit is not the villain of this story, but rather a harsh reality that we are forced to consider. Sometimes it doesn't work. ""Sometimes"" might be generous, actually. People who ""dive in"" headfirst are more likely to end up not with what they had originally imagined, but with a lot of debt and trampled dreams. Of course, this may seem very cynical, but it is still immensely important to consider the reality of the situation. My father urged me to listen to the source, to the many people who earned degrees they now regret. Fast forward to college application and decision season. In other words, we have come to one of the most painful decisions of my life, torn between two wonderfully different schools and two conflicting careers. It was completely my own decision to attend UC Santa Barbara and I have no regrets. However, in this case, UCSB was actually the “profit” side of the debate. My specialty, communication, is the best of both worlds. I wanted to explore my varied interests and challenge myself outside of the classroom. I joined the Daily Nexus to continue writing, as well as the American Marketing Association (AMA) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) business team. I really love all of that. My father and I were still somewhat dissatisfied for completely different reasons. While I longed for the fulfillment of my literary desires, my father now began to worry that communication erred too much on the side of passion and feared that I would not be able to find a job once I graduated. We both had a synchronized lightbulb moment: the long-sought double header! I could dub in English, thus fulfilling my creative desires. My father, on the other hand, thought about economics. And, for the first time in my 18 years of existence, I didn't entirely object to his suggestion. I liked the work I was doing with AMA and SAE, and a degree in economics would only enhance my experience and job prospects. And no, I was not at all motivated by the fact that one of my favorite characters from my favorite movie of all time is an economics student, absolutely not. This shift in my mindset triggered a comically large dose of cognitive dissonance, in which I defensively justified choices I hadn't even made yet. While taking Econ 1 last trimester, I kept trying to tell myself that I enjoyed it, that it was interesting to me, that I was going to do this. I would find a great, well-paying job and the added respect from my peers and mentors would be just a small bonus. My professor was great and I found the material interesting at times, but there was a nagging voice in the back of my head telling me I was giving up on my dream. I didn't feel like I was selling myself until that moment, right when I saw the cover sheet and thought, “Okay, I'll do this.”. I didn't hate economics, it wasn't that simple, but I knew that if I continued to neglect my true desires, I would. And the idea that I could hate an aspect of my upbringing, something I valued so deeply and strongly, something I had associated with electric passion and immense satisfaction, was intolerable. So, I changed my mind. Again. I decided I would dive, but not without a safety net. I'm still not entirely sure what that means for me, but I'm ready to find out. And I know it sounds so silly, because the allure of immersing yourself in your passion is the idea that you really have nothing else to turn to. You've given up everything for your one true love, just like Jonathan Larson and Mia Dolan. You are all included. But, I truly believe you can still be all-in while taking care of yourself. I could make a joke here about how we can't afford to do it ""in this economy,"" but I realized it's so undeniably true that it wouldn't even be funny. We really can't. You can, and should, pursue both passion and profit. We need both. Having both means something different to everyone. It is difficult to navigate and maintain balance, but it is very necessary. Not only does it alleviate the all-consuming anxiety of “what will you do with your life if all this creative stuff doesn't work out”, but it also broadens your perspective, skill set, and experiences. And years later, when I've figured all this out, I hope to be able to sit with my dad over coffee and laugh about the trials and tribulations we put each other through and how it was so crucial and insignificant at the same time. time because, I did it. Whatever that means, anyway. Amitha Bhat implores you to try to sidestep the false dichotomy of passion versus profit because you can have both, and you should."

la-vista,Residentes de Santa Bárbara realizan una vigilia en protesta por la anulación de Roe v. Wade,Santa Barbara residents hold vigil to protest the overturning of Roe v. Wade,"Written By: Mark Alfred Translated by: Jaynar de la Cruz Ochoa Hundreds gathered outside the Santa Barbara County Courthouse for a vigil following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the loss of federal abortion rights protections. Luz Reyes-Martín, vice president of the California Central Coast Planned Parenthood branch who organized Friday's event, addressed the crowd from the courthouse steps. ""Whether you came tonight because you are devastated, angry or simply exhausted, we share the belief that everyone's body is theirs and theirs alone,"" Martin said. ""Today we cry but tomorrow we continue fighting."" Several women shared their abortion stories at the event, including Hillside House board member Pam Flynt-Tambo. 51 years ago in a small town in Indiana, Tambo became pregnant. In a pre-Roe America, Tambo's options were limited, but she shuddered at the thought of having a third child she couldn't financially care for. ""It didn't even occur to me to ask my doctor how to get an abortion, and at the time it was illegal in Indiana,"" Tambo said. Just days after a doctor confirmed her pregnancy, she came across a Ball State University newspaper with an ad on the back page that said, ""Abortions are legal in New York."" ""The next day I brought that newspaper home and talked to my husband about how we weren't in a position to have a third child,"" she said. ""We barely broke even at the end of each month; having a third child was not something we could afford financially or emotionally."" On Valentine's Day 1971, she made the trip to New York and had an abortion. More than half a century later, Tambo shared her story with hundreds gathered in support of reproductive rights, saying she ""never regretted having an abortion,"" encouraging others to tell their stories. The overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that secured federal protection of abortion rights, has sparked nationwide protests and at least 11 states banning or severely restricting abortion. Planned Parenthood began preparing for its response to the Supreme Court decision in May 2022, when a draft majority opinion was leaked to the public, according to Reyes-Martín. ""We had a plan to have a meeting like this. Even a few days ago, we alerted all our followers that every time decision day comes, this is the plan,"" he said. ""This morning at 7 a.m. when that decision came out, we set out to implement that plan."" President and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Central Coast of California, Jenna Tosh, spoke about the severity of the Court's decision and the devastating health care crisis it is creating. ""Today I was talking on the phone with colleagues across the country who were making devastating decisions like canceling abortion appointments, turning away patients, even patients who had registered and were physically at the health center to receive services,"" she said. ""This decision has created a national health care crisis because we have never before asked 24 states to care for patients in all 50 states."" Tosh warned that the loss of Roe v. Wade may be just the first of more restrictions, including a complete federal ban on abortion that has been raised as a priority of national Republicans, including former Vice President Mike Pence. ""If we let them, their ultimate goal is to pass a nationwide abortion ban that would even affect California,"" he said. ""The judges have made it clear, they have made it clear today that they are also coming for other rights. They are coming for our right to contraception, they are coming for our right to marry who we love."" The crowd erupted into a ""Hell no"" chant at Tosh's warning. The Rev. David Moore of the New Covenant Worship Center and elected board member at the local Planned Parenthood branch described the Court's decision as one created by fear and anger. ""We must not forget that the drafters of our founding documents only intended for a few people to make decisions for others,"" he said. ""The Supreme Court doesn't respect our right to vote because they don't care about our voice because the Supreme Court is afraid and angry, and it represents people who are afraid and angry."" Moore encouraged the crowd not to be defeated by the decision, but to be motivated to fight for reproductive rights. ""Although we have received some body blows and it seems that it is better that we give up because we are losing our breath, remember that we trained to receive these body blows,"" he said. ""We exercised, we built the muscles to withstand all of this and so instead of despairing, instead of getting discouraged, instead of throwing in the towel and saying 'what's the point with America?', we're ready to take on the challenge of defending women's rights."" Planned Parenthood Central Coast President Elena Anderson took the stage lamenting the loss of Roe v. Wade. ""We knew this was coming, but it still doesn't take away the sting. There are still so many feelings of pain, anguish, disappointment, sadness, grief, anger, fury,"" he said. Anderson said the decision would disproportionately affect marginalized groups, including people of color and people who identify as LGBTQ+. Reyes-Martín ended her remarks to the crowd by encouraging supporters to destigmatize abortion through their individual stories and solidarity with one another. ""More than ever, it's those individual conversations, it's dismantling the stigma that will be so important,"" he said. ""Your commitment and solidarity help drive this movement. Generations before us have fought tirelessly to obtain and protect our rights, and now it is our turn."""

la-vista,Empleados de Goleta Starbucks buscan sindicalizarse,Goleta Starbucks employees seek to unionize,"Written by: Mark Alfred Translated by: Nora Okamoto Starbucks workers at the Goleta location at Hollister Avenue and Storke Road began casting their votes on June 1 in a unionization election. The election, organized through the National Labor Relations Board, could make them the third Starbucks to successfully unionize in California. Store manager Brynn Campos, a sophomore biology student at UC Santa Barbara, and eight other employees sent a letter to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on April 20, announcing their intention to unionize the store in Goleta. ""Starbucks workers across the country have felt ignored and undervalued by this company,"" the letter obtained by The Nexus said. ""This store itself faces daily issues related to workforce shortages, unfair overwork, and lack of compensation. Our hope with unionization is to come together so we can negotiate our working conditions with our employers on equal terms."" In an email statement to The Nexus, the Starbucks corporation said that while the unionization efforts were not in the best interest of workers, they were taking the organizer's concerns into consideration. ""We are listening and learning from partners in these stores as we always do across the country,"" the statement said. ""From the beginning, we have been clear in our belief that we are better together as partners, without a union between us, and that belief has not changed."" The company also cited its decision to increase minimum wages to $15 an hour for summer 2022, as evidence that unionization is not necessary for competitive wages. Campos said the changes enacted by the cooperation are not enough to keep up with the high cost of living in states like California. ""We have all felt the effects of inflation,"" he said. ""The minimum wage is $15 in California, which is the highest anywhere and still not enough to live on."" Campos said she was inspired to start unionizing efforts after joining the Starbucks subreddit and learning about the movement to unionize in franchises across the country, with the Buffalo, New York location being the first to successfully unionize. ""I saw more stores coming forward and just seeing what everyone was talking about and learning more about unions, I thought, 'This is something I definitely want to see in my store,'"" he said. ""I realized that, If it's going to happen in my store, someone has to make it happen and I could be that person too."" Campos started the push over spring break, talking to co-workers, about the possibility of unionizing. ""About nine years ago weeks, when I first thought, ""Okay, I'm going to start talking to my store associates,"" and for a week or two I was talking to people,"" he said. ""The next week, I was signing union cards [and] the next week we were presenting."" One of Campos' partners, Santa Barbara City College student Brooke Moore, recalled when she first heard about the unionization effort. ""Brynn called me to tell me and, At first, I just wanted to support her and any of her endeavors,"" he said. ""Then as I learned more about it, I realized it was a bit more personal for me, too. Just for the sake of all minimum wage workers, not just Starbucks employees."" Moore said that The company has a responsibility as a trendsetter to lead the way with higher wages and better hours. ""Starbucks has always been the company to set an example for others, with the support they provide to the LGBTQ+ community and the non-judgmental training they have been giving us every year,"" he said. ""They always say they're the leaders in being here for the people, and they're being a little lazy and letting us down. So I feel like we need to take responsibility."" On May 13, Starbucks stores in Long Beach and Lakewood closed. They became the first, and so far only, locations to successfully unionize in California. Campos met with organizers from both locations who helped her navigate the organizing process at her store. “I had a Zoom call with them pretty early [about] the unionization process and they gave me advice about our letter of intent to unionize and how that helps protect us as workers,” he said. ""They basically told us everything that came out of my district manager's mouth before she said it,"" Campos continued. ""I go to the back and I'm talking to my district manager and she's saying the exact same things. They have a script."" Campos described how management mobilized against the unionization effort once it started in his store. ""Our district manager [was] in the store with us a lot, having conversations with every colleague, telling everyone how scary union dues are and how bad unionization could turn out,"" he said. ""They were putting up signs in the back telling us, ""™These are the benefits [and] upgrades your guys will get in August and if you unionize, we can't guarantee them""™, which makes it look like we're going to lose an increase, in benefits, in tips."" Store workers met with Campos less frequently after she began organizing efforts, she said. ""In my work schedule, I noticed a lot fewer colleagues scheduled to work with me, specifically.

la-vista,Es Poco Probable Que Munger Hall Cumpla Con El Objetivo De Apertura De 2025,Munger Hall Unlikely to Meet 2025 Opening Goal,"Written by: Mark Alfred Translated by: Nora Okamoto UC Santa Barbara could begin construction of Munger Hall, the controversial dorm designed by billionaire Charles Munger, in the winter quarter of 2023. Courtesy of UCSB Current The university expects construction of Munger Hall will take approximately 40 months, according to UCSB Media Relations Manager Kiki Reyes, meaning the dormitory would be completed after the summer of 2026. This construction schedule is behind projections provided by UCSB last year. last, who anticipated the hall would be available to house students in the fall of 2025. ""Project timelines, as with all construction projects, can be affected by many variables and are therefore difficult predict with any specificity,"" Reyes said in an email statement to The Nexus on June 23. Flyers handed out to students and faculty during tours of UCSB's model of Munger Hall announced that the hall avoided specific targets. ""While we do not yet have a final completion date, we expect the project to take several years before welcoming students,"" the brochure said. “Additional project details will be shared as plans progress.” UCSB also has a contractual agreement known as the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) with the city of Goleta to provide housing for an additional 5,000 students by 2025, in in line with its projected enrollment growth outlined in the University of California's 2021-27 Capital Financial Plan. The university said in the document that it intends to meet LRDP requirements through Munger Hall. ""The LRDP requires the campus to provide additional housing,"" the document said. ""For every student enrolled above 20,000, the campus has agreed to provide one new bed, representing a total need of 5,000 beds by 2025."" According to the document, 1,000 of the required beds have already been provided, and More than 4,000 more are expected to come from Munger Hall, which will house more than 5,500 students. Although the LRDP calls for the remaining student housing to be completed by 2025, UCSB said an opening of Munger Hall in 2026 would not violate the agreement. “A completion in 2026 would not be inconsistent with the goals of the LRDP and we do not have any plans to amend the LRDP at this time for an increase in enrollment,” Reyes said. Reyes said the university is working with community partners to meet its obligations under the LRDP. “The housing is built in accordance with the LRDP, and the construction of this project is consistent with our LRDP,” Reyes said in a separate email statement. “The University is working hard to meet its obligations under the LRDP and is working with its community partners to mitigate any potential impacts our housing may have.” UCSB Senior Campus Planning and Design Planner Shari Hammond was further, arguing that there is no action the university can take that violates the LRPD, as long as it maintains basic development guidelines, such as designated land use and building height. ""The LRDP is a planning document, with a horizon of 2025; it identifies capital project aspirations for the identified planning horizon and lists our policies that direct that growth,"" Hammond said in an email statement to The Nexus . ""Nothing would constitute a violation of the LRDP."" The City of Goleta is currently suing UCSB for allegedly violating the LRDP, contending that the lack of student housing has caused harm to the city. The ongoing litigation has prevented city officials from commenting on the Munger Hall project, according to City of Goleta Community Relations Manager Kelly Hoover, who declined to comment on behalf of Goleta City Councilmember, James Kyriaco. Santa Barbara County has also accused UCSB of violating the LRPD based on insufficient housing options to keep up with enrollment numbers. Second District Supervisor Gregg Hart pledged to hold UCSB accountable for its housing obligations under the LRPD and emphasized the importance of ongoing conversations between the university and the County on affordable housing issues. ""Santa Barbara County is determined to bring UCSB into compliance with the student, faculty and staff housing requirements adopted in the University's long-range development plan,"" Hart said in an email statement to The Nexus. on July 7. ""Discussions between the University and the County regarding the development of critically needed affordable student housing continue and I am hopeful that these conversations will lead to demonstrable progress on this issue in the very near future."" Hart also praised the recent approval of the Ocean Road housing project as “very welcome news” as it is slated to provide 540 new residential units for faculty and staff that he said are desperately needed. Beyond the construction schedule, there is uncertainty regarding the dormitory's financing and Munger's expected contribution. Originally, it was estimated that $200 million of the more than $1 billion in construction costs came from Munger, the largest donation in UCSB history. However, the amount does not appear to be resolved and the university said it is still working on a precise funding plan. ""We are still working on financing, which we anticipate will include a certain amount of debt financing as well as a gift from Mr. Munger,"" Reyes said. The university has avoided relying solely on debt financing for housing construction because of the difficulties of using student rent as the sole source of payment, according to the university's Munger Hall FAQ. “It is nearly impossible to do this and produce the type of quality residential experience we want for our students,” the FAQ said. Munger has already contributed an undisclosed amount of funds toward the construction of UCSB's model of Munger Hall, which was paid for in full by the billionaire, according to UCSB spokeswoman Shelly Leachman. Going forward, UCSB is preparing an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the project that, when released, will trigger a 45-day public comment period. A final EIR, along with a response to public comments, would be completed before the project is submitted for final approval to the UC Regents, according to Reyes. No timeline has been determined for presenting the project to the Regents, but Reyes said UCSB would need to receive approval from the Regents in November for construction to begin in Winter Quarter 2023.

Yang investigated for fleeing crash,"Written by: Holly Rusch Translated by: Jaynar de la Cruz Ochoa UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry T. Yang was investigated by the California Highway Patrol for allegedly hitting a student who was riding a skateboard in a campus crosswalk on May 16, the LA Times reported today. The California Highway Patrol is not proceeding with legal charges because they were unable to corroborate the hit-and-run allegations or the cause of the collision. Chancellor Henry T. Yang, pictured during the 2016 convocation, denied the allegations. Daily Nexus File Photo According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) report obtained by the LA Times, the student, who suffered minor injuries, identified the chancellor as the driver. The investigation was originally handled by the UCSB Police Department, but was turned over to the CHP due to a conflict of interest. Yang's name was redacted from documents released to the public record and provided to the LA Times, but two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told the LA Times that he was the focus of the investigation and his name was removed from the public record. The student alleged he was struck by the front of the car, rolled on the hood and injured his hip and right foot, according to the police report. He fell to the ground, stood up and clearly saw the driver, a woman in the passenger seat, whom the student later identified as Dilling Yang, made hand gestures at him, but the car then left the scene, he told The authorities. The report detailed that while the student appeared to be unsure which of Yang's cars hit him when they went to Yang's property, he was able to positively identify both Yang and his wife, the alleged passenger, in a photo lineup . In a statement to the LA Times, UCSB denied the allegations and cited the CHP report, which said no physical damage was found on the chancellor's car that would indicate a collision occurred. ""This was not a hit and run,"" the university said in a statement. ""The Chancellor and his wife were surprised to learn of the allegations and have always maintained that their vehicle did not collide with anyone. The University and the Chancellor took this skater's accusations seriously."" Yang ""wants to respect the skater's report of what the skater believed occurred,"" UCSB said in its statement to the LA Times. ""Resources were made available to the skater, if requested, regardless of the origin of the injuries""."

The most significant addition for UC in the new budget, which was first proposed in January, is a $307.3 million increase in UC's ongoing general fund. Of these funds, $200.5 million will be provided over five years to “support college costs” and $98.8 million will be used to support the enrollment of California resident students. The budget also includes a one-time fund of $185 million to support UC research on climate change and $6 million to support programs that help former foster youth students, a project in which former External Affairs Vice President , Esme Quintero-Cubillán, worked during his mandate. UC President Michael V. Drake issued a statement in support of the budget after its passage.

la-vista,"Cómo caen los poderosos, y de manera espectacular","How the powerful fall, and in spectacular fashion","Written by: Blake McQuilkin Translated by: Nora Okamoto Over the past few months, major players in the cryptocurrency market, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, have gone into free fall. Crypto has been steadily losing value, a trend that appears to have been exacerbated by the sudden demise of Terra (LUNA) (now rebranded as “Terra Classic”). Terra Classic plummeted from around $80 in early May to less than a thousandth of a cent at the time of this writing. Eddie Zhao / Daily Nexus LUNA creator Do Kwon alluded to this death spiral in May when he commented on the oversaturation of the cryptocurrency market, stating that it would be fun to watch these new emerging currencies “die.” I guess he didn't think that their own currency would accompany such a group just a week later. Kwon then led a rapid attempt to resurrect his crypto in the form of a new currency, LUNA 2.0. It immediately lost more than 80% of its initial market value. I think the market speaks for itself. Unfortunately, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P 500, three of the most reliable markers of the health of the US stock market, have also seen almost constant losses in recent months, falling each time more in the red. While there are many factors at play, cryptocurrency and the stock market seem to have a terrible influence on each other. As one goes down, the other goes down too. However, instead of driving their own car off a cliff, these savvy investors have their hands on the wheel of the entire US economy. A prospect that would logically devastate not only American citizens but also the global market. Quite a fun way to plunge into a new depression. To get to the bottom of this crypto apocalypse, it must be said that these coins were formed on pillars of sand. Like any speculative market, money is based on trust. If someone trusts Ford Motor Co. to make reliable vehicles that sell, Ford becomes a potentially valuable investment. However, Ford is a company: it has physical products, it does research, it develops technology, and it has a profit margin. Crypto does not. When an investment has absolutely no markers of success and remains completely speculative, then it needs trust. Bitcoin costs as much as it does because people perceive it as not only valuable but also trustworthy. From its peak at $68,000 USD in November 2021, plummeting to around $20,000 today, it is evident that investors have lost confidence. So what is the lesson that can be learned from all this? Should it be seen as a retelling of the Icarus story? Are we seeing a crypto billionaire, once again, fly too close to the sun, only to drag his industry down with him? Possibly. What I maintain American society should learn is this: Leave now. The United States used to produce. Their economy used to be based on the physical world, making products that had use and meaning. If your mindset as an advancing society is to go further and further into the false promises of endless digital capitalism, you will fail. There can be no growth based on the whims of the stupidest investors this nation has ever produced. You simply cannot base an economy on hope, much less a currency. As a young man, I don't have much hope for my country right now. When the main route to wealth is through digital apes and whatever latest scam „¢ dominates the market, I will be the first to throw in the towel and say this isn't working. When the only money-making investments left are not based on physical products but on digital products, I don't expect America's unfettered capitalism to last. For the love of God, let's let the dreams of Bitcoin billionaires go. The time has passed. Blake McQuilkin believes that the decline of the cryptocurrency market is a trend that will ultimately continue."

Vincent has advanced throughout this 2021-22 season, establishing himself as an impact backup and strong rotation player for the Heat. While the Heat primarily play through Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, they rely on their other players like Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson to hit critical shots. With the introduction of Vincent, the Heat went from 19th in 3-point percentage in 2020-21 to third in the league last season. Vincent played a key role in this development with his 8.7 points per game, more than double what he averaged last season. In the postseason, Vincent made an even bigger impact by scoring 15 points in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Prior to his success in the NBA, Vincent had a notable career in the NCAA. He attended the University of California, Santa Barbara as an undergraduate and was a member of the UCSB men's basketball team from 2015 to 2018. As a gaucho, Vincent averaged 12.8 points per game, and in 2016, he led UCSB to the Vegas semifinals. 16. He then went undrafted with the Miami Heat and has improved each season. Vincent has established himself as one of the most developed gauchos in the NBA. With fellow Gaucho JaQuori McLaughlin entering the league last season, there is hope for an upward trend of UCSB alumni finding success in their transition to the NBA. Standing at 6-foot-3 at shooting guard, Vincent has a highly polished playing style that specializes in his shooting and defense. Vincent was named the NBA G League Most Improved Player for the 2019-20 season. His efforts and determination allowed him to be an outstanding undrafted player for the Miami Heat. Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra praised Vincent after he took over the starting job from an injured Kyle Lowry. Spoelstra stated, ""Gabe is a great competitor and he's been able to shapeshift into different roles, which is really important. That's a talent.""The Miami Heat had a 27-23 record when Vincent was on the court. Vincent is paving the way for many college athletes outside of the prestigious NCAA athletic schools. An individual like Vincent, who went undrafted and managed to work his way into a strong rotational role for a contending NBA team, further proves that there is no one path to success. Vincent demonstrates that for people looking to do anything professionally, efforts and skills will exceed any accredited background."
la-vista,Turning Red me pone colorada,Turning Red makes me blush,"Blake Allen / Daily Nexus When I first heard that Pixar announced the release of a new film centered around a Chinese-Canadian girl, I thought it would be a coup for Asian representation in media. I must admit, it was difficult to hide my disappointment after discovering that, once again, the POC (protagonist of color, as I like to call him) transforms into another non-human entity for a significant portion of his screen time. Why is Hollywood obsessed with turning people of color into animals? We should celebrate ""Turning Red."" Directed by Domee Shi, who is notable for her direction on the allegorical short film ""Bao,"" this film stands out as Pixar's first feature film with an Asian lead. The inclusion of Asian-centric world-building in animated films over the past few decades is encouraging. However, I hesitate to celebrate these milestones. ""Such victories are long overdue,"" so why has it been so long? Those who work tirelessly to bring these characters to life deserve to be recognized. The presence of representation for marginalized communities in these films is a sign of progress The fact that this progress even exists ""“ rather than representation being the norm ""“ is, however, intrinsically the result of obstacles in Hollywood initiated by the perpetuation of stereotypes. Movies like “Turning Red” are. crucial to Asian representation, but their success falters when films consistently follow the pattern of relying on the image of Asian individuals and other individuals in the BIPOC community for that matter, as something 100% human Immediately, ""The Princess and the. toad"" comes to mind. Disney's first black princess was a toad rather than a princess for most of the time in her own film, ""ripped of her human qualities and made to prance around like a toad in front of younger viewers and their parents, who some saw themselves being represented as part of the Disney princesses for the first time."" Kuzco, from the movie ""The Emperor and His Follies,"" and Kenya, from the movie ""Land of the Bears,"" are two other examples of characters who have fallen into the hands of the same fate: the Inca emperor becomes an alpaca, and the last Inuit child becomes a bear. Even more recent, the Pixar film ""Soul,"" featuring a jazz pianist who finds himself in the afterlife, repeats the same pattern when the black protagonist transforms into a cat. of therapy for a portion of the film. Someone pointed out to me the possibility that these animation studios value the charm and joyful nature of having talking animals. Beyond the protagonists, animated films for children have a history of including supporting animal characters: Pascal, the chameleon in the movie ""Tangled""; Sebastian and Flounder, the sea creatures in ""The Little Mermaid""; and Gus and Jaq, the mice in ""Cinderella."" Even the movie ""Brave"" follows the same tragic transformation from human to animal when Merida's mother turns into a bear. Don't get me wrong; I love a good Gary Oldman peacock villain, especially one who laments how many times he has to ""kill the same filthy panda."" As funny as the lines are, though, sometimes I want to Listen to them from the point of view of a human, not a peacock. “Turning Red” has a predominantly Asian cast and crew. One thing the film does do well is refer to lived experiences as a reference for the construction. of the story. Although some reviewers have criticized that the film cannot be related much and that it is very narrow because the protagonist is a 13-year-old girl, ""the objective of the film is to transport you into the story. head of someone you've never met to teach you something about yourself in the process. A young film critic applauds ""Turning Red"" for its telling of the discomfort and ""uncontrollable chaos"" that comes with the topic of puberty through the lenses of a Chinese-Canadian teenager. That said, ""life imitates art"" or perhaps art imitates life. Either way, Oscar Wilde would most likely agree that representation has power. Our perception of our lives and the world in What we see on screen can affect the way we look at Asian communities in real life. Is making people of color part of the infamy supposed to happen? Pixar's tradition of animalizing its protagonists is inclusive? Does the blow hit harder because the Asian community already faces racist insults and hate crimes on a daily basis? There is no need to continue the connection that is constant about Asians. and other BIPOC characters with animals. We have come far in terms of Asian representation in the media, but we must make progress if we don't, we risk being stuck in a state where a negative message is sent to Asian observers. young and old alike. And frankly, it's a dehumanizing one. Zoí« Lo has to work things out with Hollywood but sends a lot of love to the Asian creators who work hard to make representation a reality."
la-vista,Garantí­as de alojamiento estudiantil no regresaran hasta que se agrega aún más alojamiento,Student housing guarantees will not return until even more housing is added,"Students at the University of California Santa Barbara have relied on Plan 2 and 2 for years, a housing program that guarantees two years of housing in university apartments to university students as long as they live their first and second years in the school dormitories. As a result of the pandemic, the program and housing guarantees like the will not return until more housing spaces are created, according to UCSB media relations manager Kiki Reyes ""It is currently not possible to offer a guarantee of housing. 4 years considering the increase in interest in university housing that we have seen recently,” Reyes said in a statement to the Nexus. “We hope to be able to offer these options in the future as more bedrooms are added to our inventory.” Testimonials on the site of programs 2 and 2 emphasized the importance towards the student community. ""In my 2nd year of school, I still wanted to live on campus and not have to face the hassle of looking for an apartment"" read a student testimonial, ""I realized It was convenient that I was guaranteed two years in the UCSB apartments which seemed cheaper and less fuss than trying to find a place in IV or Goleta."" A message appeared on the site in the summer of 2020, explaining that ""given the uncertainty surrounding the current public health crisis."" UCSB will not be able to provide housing guarantees ""at this time."" The disclaimer remained there after the summer of 2021 until the site was completely deleted. In the absence of housing guarantees, students who planned to live in on-campus housing were denied contracts and left to search for more expensive apartments in and around Isla Vista. UCSB suggested starting their housing search early and offered a rental listing service in conjunction with an initial housing workshop to help struggling students find housing. Other California University campuses suspended their housing guarantees at the beginning of the pandemic. In an effort to combat COVID-19, UC San Diego allowed students to live only in single and double dorms but not triples, leaving them with fewer bedroom spaces and then suspension of housing guarantees. UCSD announced last month that its housing guarantees would be fully reintroduced for the fall quarter of 2023, when 2,000 university beds are set to be added with the opening of the Theater Living District and Learning Neighborhood. UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Merced showed a form of housing guarantee with the return of students this fall. Only UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Santa Barbara were missing. UCLA recently became the first UC to provide four years of housing for all undergraduates who apply. At UCSB, the shortage of guarantees is just one of the struggles over the lack of housing, which has prompted complaints from the city of Goleta and Santa Barbara County. In response to the most recent complaint, UCSB highlighted its ""recently completed projects"" which added 1,500 student beds, referring to the San Joaquín and Sierra Madre buildings which were completed five and six years ago, respectively. Like UCSD, UCSB needs to build more student housing before reintroducing collateral. The university requested Munger Hall, which would add more than 4,500 student beds if built, to resolve student housing obligations. The dormitory would not be completed until at least 2026, and in the absence of other accommodation options, it is unclear when collateral will return.

I have never been completely alone, without my friends and family who spoke my native language. If you find yourself in the same horrible situation, don't worry, I'll tell you everything you need to know about the Latinx support our new home offers. Acclimatize to the new school year with all the resources at your disposal. In 2015, the university was declared a Hispanic student-serving institution. And to maintain that title, the University of California, Santa Barbara offers many resources for those who identify as Chicanx or Latinx, as they make up 29% of the student population. The Ondas student center is one of those places. The center provides academic support in a focused learning space where students can connect with faculty and other students. The university campus also has two Chicanx/Latinx cultural resource centers. The Arnulfo Casillas Center is located in building 406 and the Chicanx/Latinx Cultural Resource Center (CLCRC) is located in the Student Resources Building (SRB). These centers support the Chicanx/Latinx community with a safe space for people of our identity. There they can study and find solace among other students with similar backgrounds. Here you can appreciate the Hispanic culture and heritage, especially for the traditions they bring to the center such as an altar for the day of the dead. Being away from home is scary but hopefully the reminders that even though you are far away you are not alone bring you a sense of peace. Likewise, the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is a resource that provides mentors, individual counseling and more student support aimed primarily at first-generation students and those who meet the income amount. Undocumented students can also find a space in the monarcha room where they offer legal support and retention services. The campus has approximately 35 organizations targeting Chicanx/Latinx students which include academic, cultural, religious, Greca, political, social organizations and many more. Among these organizations, you are sure to find people with whom you can coexist. UCSB has many community events that can bring you closer to the nostalgic feeling of being home such as Bienvenida, Dia de los Muertos, Celebración de la Familia and even a graduation ceremony specifically for students of Chicanx/Latinx heritage. Although it sounds a little cheesy and perhaps even repetitive, it is true that you can find a place at UCSB. There is always someone to share experiences with and even more importantly, ask for help and support. I myself have found myself using these resources more than anything. Programs like EOP not only help academically, but also emotionally and financially. If you meet the requirements, you may be eligible for some scholarships that pay for your health fractures. They refunded me what I paid out of pocket when I went to the dentist and the eye doctor. Likewise, EOP counselors offer you real advice that shows that they really support you. I also spent and spend a lot of time in El Centro behind Liberia. It's a great place to study: silence and comfortable seats. Personally, Liberia often gives me anxiety because of how shocked it always is but when I'm in El Centro I almost never get the feeling. On the contrary, I get a feeling of tranquility and focus that I use to excel in my studies (and I also like to chat with my Latinx people). I hope this helps you and motivates you to call UCSB home. Always remember: You are not alone."

Maddy Fangio / Daily Nexus Students and volunteers at the St. George Youth Center have completed two new murals in Estero Park this summer. flowers and sunsets over the sea""“ with the help of the Campus Conexiones introductory program. The program was coordinated by recent UC Santa Barbara Gevirtz doctoral graduate Stephanie Arguera with support from the Center for Publicly Engaged Scholarship and the Department of Education, Dr. Rebeca Mireles-Rios. Youth from the youth center began the project in the winter quarter of 2022, attending weekly workshops and activities with Latinx students, faculty, and staff at UCSB. In the spring, the youth center leadership group began the design process to brainstorm, sketch and vote on potential mural ideas. “I was involved in brainstorming and we all helped draw a final draft and stencils for the floral mural,” 8th grade student and muralist Diego Lopez said. ""I like that as a team we were able to create good ideas and accelerate the project. The group decided on two designs after multiple sketches, templates and cardboard mockups. Pieces from previous years included representations of marine animals, nature scenes, quotes and more depictions of youth at I.V. A grand total of six murals have been painted by the youth center since 2017, including the two new addictions ""We really dug into it and put it together because the first idea always sounds great, but It's important to take some time away and come back to it,"" Arguera said. Painting of the murals began in June after the designs were approved by the I.V. Park and Recreation District. A team of 20 youth from the center, along with Arguera and additional community volunteers completed the installations over approximately two weeks. A dedication ceremony took place on June 27 celebrating the unveiling of the two murals. This year's project marked a return to regular operations for the St. George Youth Center, following a disruption to its activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Arguera. ""Young people in the center typically look forward to the big project in the summer, and to have it taken away is unfortunate, without a doubt,"" Arguera said. ""But I will say [this year] it wasn't as easy as previous years. I think we're all returning to a sense of normality, so putting it back into practice was different than years past."" Lopez, who frequents the youth center regularly, she noted that she appreciates all the activities and support accessible at the center. ""I like going to the youth center and not directly home because it's always a good time there,"" Lopez said. ""I like to play Speed ​​with Raul and Connect Four. Sometimes we even cook and play for prizes."" After a few weeks in the summer heat, with snacks and supplies provided by the center, Arguera described the murals as something of the creations of young people. ""My favorite part is just seeing the feeling of success and responsibility over a fairly large piece of art that is public and will be looked at for years,"" she said. ""It takes an investment, but it makes it worth it."" Since the project's completion in June, a portion of the sunset mural has been defaced with graffiti. The center has not yet been able to remove the graffiti, according to youth center director Raul Macias, who also said most of the graffiti took place on a nearby empty wall. ""We noticed it and we felt very sad and we wondered why someone would do something like that on the children's mural,"" Lopez said. ""I hope we fix it soon."" St. George Youth Center is planning to build more murals in the summer of 2023. Beyond painting, the center provides after-school and summer programs for those in grades 5-12, including cooking classes, robotics training, tutoring and various sports. ""The center is basically a safe haven for the local community, teens and families,"" Macias said. ""Isla Vista is a unique place with a high percentage of college population, so we serve underserved communities of families and teens."""
la-vista,IVCSD expande el programa Isla Vista Beautiful,IVCSD Expands Isla Vista Beautiful Program,"Norton recently executed a project to remove shoes hanging from Cox Communications cables in Isla Vista, collecting 341 pairs of shoes that weighed 585 pounds. Courtesy of IVCSD The Isla Vista Community Services District recently hired a team of five employees to conduct operations for the Isla Vista Beautiful program as they expand their program to rid Isla Vista of trash, graffiti and weeds. The Isla Vista Beautiful program originated in 2018 in collaboration with the independent nonprofit United Way ""“ dedicated to serving the Santa Barbara community with a focus on academic achievement, financial empowerment, and crisis response and recovery. In When the contract between the two ended this year, the Isla Vista Community Services District (IVCSD) moved to operate the program directly and employ an in-house staff. Previous collaboration with United Way provided employment opportunities. to people facing housing insecurity after a work experience training program with I.V. Beautiful. ""[United Way couldn't] fulfill the contract so we decided to do it internally so we could follow it,"" IVCSD general manager Jonathan Abboud said. ""They were turning in a different direction as an organization, so this was no longer part of their mission."" Abboud said IVCSD is looking to revive the job training program for community members experiencing homelessness and develop a separate budget with whom to do it. ""We have a separate budget to maybe hire a nonprofit organization who also serves to give work experience to the homeless population,"" Abboud said. ""We will have to specifically contract with other nonprofits as soon as we find someone we can work with."" Norton said that under his leadership, the program will try to continue addressing priority issues for the Isla Vista community, including litter and graffiti . ""We feel that bringing beautification projects to Isla Vista is very important for the well-being of the people who live there and the environment,"" Norton said. ""We want to focus on graffiti abatement, trash pickup, weed removal and streetlight improvements as well as working with local businesses to keep our business district clean and beautiful."" Norton recently executed a project to remove shoes hanging from street lamps. Cox Communications wires after Isla Vista, collecting 341 pairs of shoes with a total weight of 585 pounds. Cox Communications were happy to take the shoes down to deliver to Isla Vista Beautiful, according to Norton. ""Some of the [shoes] were in a condition where they couldn't be worn again, but most of them could, so they collaborated with some local nonprofits who were able to take many of the shoes and distribute them to people those who needed it,"" she said. Norton also emphasized creating a ""culture of respect and care"" among the community to motivate people to limit waste and the environmental damage they create. ""It's in such a special place by the ocean,"" Norton said. ""I hope to do that through education and commitment to the community and general knowledge."" Norton said educating citizens on how to properly dispose of trash and recycling represents a primary mission of Isla Vista Beautiful, especially during student moving season when their leases are up. Norton added that the campaign with Cox Communication to remove shoes also provided an opportunity for community engagement regarding environmental waste harm. ""I hope to take this experience and use it to tell the community how best to donate these shoes,"" she said. ""They accumulate and a lot of them end up in the trash, and it would be better if we didn't throw them there."" Isla Vista Beautiful is operating on a budget of $196,000 for this fiscal year and could potentially expand in the future by holding events volunteers. Abboud said the modernization of Isla Vista Beautiful, with the hiring of Norton and four other employees, has allowed the program to execute projects at a high level of quality and efficiency. ""We haven't had anyone who has really focused on issues like litter and graffiti and lighting at IVCSD, so having someone whose full-time job is to take care of Isla Vista in this way is new for I.V. and I think you're going to see shocking results,"" Abboud said. Abboud recognized Norton's contributions as elevating the program to accomplish larger projects than before. ""Could we have organized what Jenna did with Cox's shoes sooner? Maybe, but it wouldn't have been anywhere near the level of quality of work and we couldn't have done it with the same frequency and efficiency."""
la-vista,Mamá sabe mejor: limpias con huevo y otros dichos,Mom knows best: you clean with eggs and other sayings,"Like any obedient daughter, I never doubted the health mantras my mother taught me, even though they sounded ridiculous. The questions I had were met with ""just because"", ""because I said""or even ""what a question you asked me"", so I just took it as fact. Since I have a few years on me, I can distinguish what is true from what is superstitious, although it does not stop me from following these ways of living. So today I will tell you all the sayings and superstitions that my mother taught me as well as tell you if you should follow them too. ""Don't go out with wet hair!"" We've all heard the famous saying about not going out with wet hair, unless you catch a cold. If you have to go out after a shower, it's better to dry your hair. Likewise, you should not step on the cold floor barefoot since you will see the same result: a few days sick. Although going out with a wet head can be uncomfortable and cold, after discussing with some experts (WebMD) it does not guarantee that you will get sick so continue with your morning showers. Barefoot with Andrés Ah Andrés, the one who visits us every month, the least favorable and most frustrating time. According to all moms, walking barefoot during your menstrual period can even make it worse. Supposedly, when you walk barefoot on the icy floor, your menstrual cramps will be too painful. After rigorous research (Google search), I have found that it is true, because of the arteries that connect our feet to the reproductive organs and the chakras involved with those systems. So this is a physical and spiritual fact! The socks will simply stay on. Onion with socks I never doubted many of the strange things my mom did for my health because for some reason they always worked. When my brothers and I were sick, my mother put a piece of onion in our socks, telling us that it kills viruses and purifies the blood. Although it is not so true, onion still contains antibiotic properties that although it will not alleviate diseases, it can have antibacterial results if you rub it on your legs. I would say who knew but obviously it was my mother. The famous egg cleanse More of a spiritual practice, the egg cleanse cleanses your aura and eliminates bad energies and vibes that could ruin your week. The ritual is said to solve problems such as headaches, general malaise, low mood and envy. I don't know about you, but during these times, I need all the support I can get. Sweep on your feet and you won't get married. Love sayings are some of my favorites and the ones that are always on my mind. Apparently sweeping is not only a chore I had to do, but an act that may dictate the rest of my romantic life. When it was my younger sister's turn to sweep, she never turned down the opportunity to sweep my feet and give me a shout-out for the fact that I'm not getting married. How mean! Buy shoes and they will leave you Another loving saying, if you buy shoes for your partner, it is superstition that they will leave you, or get out of your life. It reminds me of the superstition that you can't knit a sweater for your partner or you'll face the same fate. It makes me wonder if the same thing also applies to a pair of huaraches? They are simply sayings, they are superstitions but when I face them, they fill me with a deep and loving feeling partly because it reminds me of my mother. Although I don't believe it all, rest assured that in my life, my luck will never fail."
la-vista,Los estudiantes hablan sobre el estatus de UCSB como una Institución de Servicio Hispano al momento en que la universidad sintoniza la alianza para las universidades de investigación al servicio de los hispanos.,Students discuss UCSB's status as a Hispanic Serving Institution as the university tunes into the alliance for Hispanic-Serving Research Universities.,"Courtesy of United Sisters. UC Santa Barbara “”named a 2015 Hispanic Serving Institution”“ announced this month its affiliation with the Alliance of Hispanic Serving Universities. The Nexus spoke with Hispanic students affiliated with Latinx-serving student organizations on campus to examine how successfully the university serves these students. The goal of the alliance, “which expands to nine states and twenty institutions,” is to double the number of Latino doctoral students and increase Hispanic faculty by 2030, a UCSB press release in August stated. UCSB has held the Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) designation, “which is earned when 25% of the students enrolled at the institution are Hispanic” for seven years and was the first member of the Association of American Universities to win the title. The designation provides eligibility to apply for Minority Serving Institution grants, internships and partnerships to found various programs serving Hispanic students on campus. Some of these programs include Educational Excellence and Inclusive Training Opportunities, Field-Based Undergraduate Engagement through Research, Teaching and Education, Opening New Doors to Accelerate Success, among others. “UC Santa Barbara has been a trendsetter,” director of the UCSB Institute of Chicano Studies and professor of Chicano studies, Dolores Inés Casillas, said in a press release. ""We are a stronger R-1 institution because we are a minority-serving institution. You cannot offer world-class education and research experience without having a diverse body of students, faculty and staff."" The university failed to respond to multiple requests regarding the details of the partnership and the benefits it will provide to Hispanic students and faculty. Not all of UCSB's Hispanic population believes the university is fully committed to supporting Hispanic students navigate their undergraduate careers. For fifth-year history of public policy and law student Christian Zuñiga, advancing at UCSB as a first-generation student was not easy. ""I'm a first-generation student—I have Mexican ancestors, my parents are immigrants, and at some point the university expelled me,"" Zuñiga said. ""I realized that a lot of things were on my part, but I feel that the institution itself did not adequately prepare me with the knowledge and information that a first-generation student should have to be able to deal with upcoming problems."" Fourth-year student majoring in Spanish, Erik Magaña, spoke about the lack of communication and knowledge of resources on campus. He says that as a Latinx student he always had to go the extra mile to look for resources. “I feel like I'm doing well only because I really took the initiative to look for them,” Magaña said. ""For someone who doesn't know what they want to do, it will be very difficult."" Magaña noted that among his social circles he has seen his friends having difficulty graduating on time or not graduating at all due to the lack of support from the university. ""The number of friends I've had who didn't graduate because of one or two classes that they weren't told about is ridiculous, and that's just in my circle,"" Magaña said. ""This just shows that academic advising is understaffed and under-resourced, and Latinx students are the ones who are going to be the most impacted, as they are more likely to be first generation and low-income."" Similarly, for fourth-year sociology student and Hermanas Unidas member Joanna Jaime, navigating the bureaucracy of UCSB services has been difficult. ""I personally haven't used campus resources [because] I'm not sure how to get them,"" Jaime said. ""I think there could be easier steps for students to know how to access resources."" Zuñiga said he wishes he had known about the resources available for academic assistance and noted that being HIS (Hispanic Serving Institution) does not stop when reaching the enrollment threshold for Hispanic students. ""Yes, I was accepted, but how are you assisting me in retaining and graduating in a specialization that I initially entered with?"" Zuñiga said. ""I remember when I experienced that, feeling very frustrated and thinking I was stupid, when in reality it was an institutional failure."" Students expressed a consensus of frustration regarding the lack of communication between the university and Hispanic students, which resulted in students being uninformed of various resources or leading them to confront the inaccessible system. As part of Hermanas Unidas, “a campus organization that provides leadership opportunities and resources for Latinx students,” fourth-year sociology student Anelis Herrera saw that many juniors and seniors were unaware of the existence of the organization until they tuned in for the first time this year. ""It always saddened me that we had juniors and seniors and we said, 'why didn't you participate since your freshman year?' and they said, 'we didn't know about the club,'"" Herrera said. For Jaime, the initiation and promotion of resources and services for Latinx students is primarily initiated by student-led initiatives alongside campus student organizations, thus taking the lead in retaining spaces by and to support Latinx students. ""I feel supported by the organization I am a part of, not necessarily the school,"" Jaime said. ""I think Hermanas Unidas has provided me with a home away from home. My first year was definitely very difficult in terms of socialization and trying to find a community out there, but this organization has definitely improved my school experience."" Magaña said UCSB should put more care and effort into promoting resources and directing those resources to Latinx students and other marginalized groups who need them most. ""There must be much more communication,"" Magaña said. ""If you Google something, it should be the first thing that comes up. If there's an event and information about opportunities, all of these campus resources should be there. Communication is a big part of why these resources that are supposed to be used are being underutilized and are not being directed to the students who need them most."" Mainly, Magaña said he wants the university to go beyond just reaching an enrollment percentage and work on academic attention and actively support Hispanic students in their journeys through UCSB. “I think the most important part is accepting the HSI status and not just using it as 'we've reached the percentage'” Magaña said. ""Beyond recruitment, you have to go much further with retention."" Magaña added that a more immersive and frequent distribution of resources would benefit UCSB's Latinx student community. “We have now been an HSI for seven years.” “There definitely shouldn't be such a slow move on such a large campus with these initiatives,” he continued. “The money is there. We need recognition at the university level, we have the people here and the money is there[We need] an immersion of HSI-funded initiatives that target underserved communities here.""

la-vista,"Checos en Isla Vista, de apodo a restaurante","Czechs in Isla Vista, from nickname to restaurant","Written by: Pricila Flores, DEI and Co-Founder of La Vista and Mari Villalpando-Ortega, Editor of La Vista The newest restaurant in the Isla Vista neighborhood opened on October 1st. They opened their doors at ten in the morning and by six in the afternoon, all the food was sold. This was the grand debut of the new restaurant, Checos en Isla Vista. Checos offered free tacos for the community to celebrate their first day. Shiuan Cheng/Daily Nexus. Checos' story was not something that Sergio Ortega, the Chef Partner, had planned. Originally, Ortega envisioned creating a more complete restaurant as a tribute to his grandmother, a place where people could sit and read the menu while waiters waited on them. But upon arriving in Isla Vista, Ortega saw that the culture around it was relaxed and student. Then he thought that his first idea did not fit with the environment and changed his vision to make it faster food to be able to keep up with the students at UC Santa Barbara. ""Something faster is customary in Mexico, near the schools where. They serve you quickly and you come and go,"" Ortega says. ""Something more practical that understands the life of the student."" The name, Checos, came easily. As a third generation of men in his family with the name Sergio, the nickname for Ortega was always Czech. In all the projects and restaurants that Ortega has taken part in, there has always been a connection with the family and his ancestors. From Michoacán, Ortega brought flavors from home so that the people of Isla Vista can taste the flavor of downtown. your home. ""Trying to just remember what things taste like. At a point in my career it's easier for me to translate it into a memory or an idea onto a plate,"" Ortega says. ""If I try something and think [about what] they put in it, little by little the recipe comes out."" Checos' menu offers mostly tacos with the option of making a combo with rice and beans. Although the menu has a mushroom taco option, Ortega wants to bring more vegetarian and vegan dishes and tacos. The star of the menu is the carnitas,"" a dish that Ortega researched and experimented with many recipes to find his home specialty. ""The people who make carnitas use family recipes as well as exclusive ones only among themselves, like their treasures. But you learn with the passage of time, really what I put in this recipe already starts with me, maybe I teach it to my daughters,"" Ortega says. ""I only use certain parts of the animal because here too I believe that People don't like kidney, tripe, liver and all that."" Checos' goal is for the food to taste like home. And that's why everything they serve is handmade. ""The sauces are homemade, The rice is Mexican red and it is made at home with the ladies I have in the morning and we make the tortillas here,"" Ortega says. And that is the food of Michoacán and of Mexico in general, food from home, fresh, made right here."" Incorporating his Michoacán roots, Ortega brings something unique to the city of Isla Vista. To ensure that Checos lives up to its brand of authenticity, everything they serve is fresh, just like at home. Ortega didn't expect the support he found when he arrived, especially the enthusiasm and student curiosity. After his big premiere, Ortega plans to incorporate even more specialties from Michoacán, as he shared that he thinks Mexican food is no longer considered foreign. In itself, after a great debut with a lot of support from relatives and UCSB students, Oretga foresees great things for him. the future of Checos in Isla Vista."
la-vista,La Grandeza Mexicana llega a Isla Vista,Mexican Greatness comes to Isla Vista,"A woman dressed in a white lace dress walks out with an expression of sadness mixed with confusion. She places her hands in front of her vibrantly embroidered apron. He enters the audience, his head looking everywhere, as if he were looking for someone. ""He's looking for you,"" a mother tells her son, joking with him. The first Mexican Grandeza show was at the Isla Vista school. Pricila Flores / Daily Nexus. The audience stands still as the woman dressed in white lace finally finds her love. His love, dressed in all white, meets his wife. As soon as they meet, they start dancing to a sensual rhythm. It is obvious that they are a couple. The public shouts and screams at them. That's how Isla Vista's first school was transformed into a stage for the Los Angeles folklore group, Grandeza Mexicana. The group arrived in Santa Barbara for three dance sessions. They came as part of the ""Live the Art of Santa Barbara"" series, which is a program organized by UCSB Arts & Lectures. The program is dedicated to bringing people together to celebrate the culture and heritage of Latin America. Mexican Greatness specifically focuses on preserving the traditions and customs of Mexico's past. Their first show in Santa Barbara was on the Isla Vista school stage. An hour before the doors opened, people were already waiting to enter. The school gym was transformed into a concert space. People filled the room and the chairs that the little students sit every day. The show lasted a full hour with seven dances and costume changes. ""It feels very very nice, we as dancers are full of emotion because we have the opportunity to share what we love to do with other communities,"" said a dancer from the Grandeza Mexicana company, Josue Silva. ""I think the audience has a little more recognition and we have a little more personal relationship because here in Santa Barbara they are more intimate like we have the opportunity to do in the schools."" In every dance and song, Grandeza Mexicana brought the energy to the scenery. Following the first song, 2 dancers came out on stage wearing teal dresses with different colors intertwined in the skirt and blouse of the dress. Members of the audience let out a gasp. ""Is this Frida Kahlo?"" is heard from the audience in a barely inaudible murmur. The audience still hasn't fully appreciated the colors of the dress and the steps when the men come out from behind the stage. Whiffing and screaming, they get on stage to accompany the women. The moment their shoes touch the wood of the stage, they start dancing. Dressed in gentleman mode, complete with a fringed jacket on the shoulders and back. With each movement, the fringes of the jackets jumped in unison, giving more character to the costume and dance. So the night continued, changing songs and costumes to represent different parts of Mexico. In one room the music was suddenly cut off, but the dancers did not stop and the audience joined in with rhythmic applause and shouts to encourage them to continue. The vibes were electrifying with crowd pride. The group enjoyed interacting with audience members throughout the night. And the audience gave him reactions. In the fifth act, similar to how they began the show, the dancers performed a scene. A woman comes out from backstage wearing a bright yellow dress. Go down the stage steps to be on the floor where the audience is sitting. Although her dress is a bright and strong color, she comes out shy. A man walks out of the audience, tipping his hat to a woman in the audience. The woman blushed and her husband teased her. When the man reaches the front, he asks the dancer for her hand to dance. Still shy, she tells him no. After a series of yes or no's, they begin to dance together. Not a minute passes when another woman comes out from behind and breaks the woman's man. The two begin to fight in a playful manner and then they attack the man. The audience laughs as they fake punch each other and run backstage. In song six, the familiar notes of the popular song, El Toro, broke through the gym. The audience began to murmur with excitement, singing along with the lyrics of the song. The dancers, using the vibrations of the audience, kicked like bulls before linking in the dance movements. By the time the last note of the last song was danced, the audience broke into chants of ""˜another, another, another.""™ It was obvious that this show is more about dancing and singing for the audience. This show represents a piece of the country they left behind."
la-vista,"8M: Dí­a internacional de la mujer, un dí­a de reflexión, lucha e inspiración","8M: International Women's Day, a day of reflection, struggle and inspiration","""Girls are not touched"", ""We are the cry of those who no longer have a voice"", ""I am the sister of the woman who will never be touched"", are just some of the phrases that are seen and heard in the streets of Latin America on March 8. The story of how this date originated begins in 1908 when 129 women died in the factory where they worked, while demonstrating demanding better working conditions and fair wages. SIMONE MANSELL / DAILY NEXUS Today this date marks an important day in the fight for rights for women universally. Likewise, it brings to light issues of gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women. Although protests occur all over the world, the large number of women who continually take to the streets in protest is in Latin America, which reflects the way in which the increase in violence and lack of support has been enough and must change. This date is a day when women from Latin America and the world forget their differences and take to the streets to protest, shout, march and make their stories visible to the world. Women protest for their daughters, their sisters, their mothers, friends who in one way or another share the suffering and anger of living in a society that accepts these facts. They shout their pain when they see that no one is interested in seeking justice for the women whose lives have already been claimed by violence. Women paint the streets purple while remembering the names and faces of the girls and women who were victims of violence in which numbers unfortunately increase every day. In these marches, songs are sung that make your skin crawl. One that makes itself known is ""Canción Sin Miedo"" by Vivir Quintana. The depth of its lyrics has made it an emblematic song of the marches and the feminist movement. Other forms of protest that are seen on the streets include reading poems and personal stories, posting photos of feminicides and aggressors who are free, carrying posters with messages and drawings that make your skin crawl, and above all, providing support from woman to woman. . This is to let the government and society know that a change is not only necessary, but demanded. There are many reasons why women march. It is not an isolated situation that only touches the lives of a few women, the violence and inequality resulting from a culture of machismo and misogyny that is seen every day is costing the lives of hundreds of women and their families. According to the national survey on the dynamics of household relationships by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), in Mexico 70% of women aged 15 and over have suffered from violence throughout their lives either psychological, physical, sexual or economic. The case of the Escobedo family is a story that, although it happened fifteen years ago, still touches the hearts of many. Marisela Escobedo Ortiz was the mother of Rubí Escobedo, a 16-year-old girl. The beginning of his life as a social activist began when his daughter was murdered by his partner, Sergio Rafael Barraza. Given the lack of support that the authorities gave her to solve the case, Marisela and her family took on the task of searching for Rubí's feminicide to bring him to justice. They were the ones who found him and handed him over to the authorities. However, although he confessed to his crime and pointed out the exact place where the events occurred, he was declared not guilty and released. After months of protest and strong threats towards Marisela, she was murdered in front of the Chihuahua government palace while protesting against the corrupt government that helped Barraza's release. Her death was not in vain because she was the source of inspiration and example to follow for many women to not stop demanding a life in which fear, violence and aggression do not win. Being a woman brings with it many burdens that have been imposed for centuries. These same burdens limit the full development of not only girls and women, but also boys and men and people identified with other genders. These circles of violence that continue to be present in homes feed a system designed to favor a limited number of typically male people. Violence towards women, although prevalent, is little talked about in Spanish-speaking homes, especially if a culture of machismo is continually being implemented. It is important to highlight that there have been many positive advances that provide support to women and their growth in all capacities, but given that this is seen as a ""privilege"" and not basic human rights and is not provided to all women , whether in rural communities, transgender women, etc. It is more than necessary to go out and demand justice and equity. In a society that ignores and belittles the experience of women on a daily basis, women take up March 8 as a day of ""celebration"" for them and it becomes a day in which it is necessary to raise awareness, start conversations, question and learn. This date is not a day of celebration, it is a day when you need to reflect and educate yourself on how to change the stories of women who were or are being impacted daily by acts of violence. There are many topics that a single article will never cover, such as the ridiculous standards of beauty, the experiences of transgender women and the great contribution they have made to their communities, the ways that sexist culture also affects boys and men, the taboo of menstruation, among other things that this writer probably needs to learn as well as discard the ideas that were imposed by society since childhood. That is why during this month of March, which is women's month, I invite you to learn more about the reasons why these women take to the streets and the role you can play in this community. As Spanish-speaking students at UCSB, it is important not to turn a blind eye to what is happening not only in Latin America but also in our own community. It is our duty to be constantly learning and practicing it, not just listening to the problems. It does not mean that it is mandatory to wear a purple scarf and declare yourself a feminist ""“ no. Sometimes that path is not for everyone and it is respected, but it is necessary to raise your voice. It is not easy to be the person who says enough is enough, but yes Something can be learned from this movement, it is that fear is no longer sufficient motivation to remain silent."
la-vista,Simplemente Dicho: ¿Conoces tu marihuana?,Simply Said: Do you know your marijuana?,"The cannabis plant, a leafy plant of phytocannabinoids, a class of natural chemical compounds and terpenoids, tiny, strong-smelling molecules produced in thousands of species of different plants. The phytocannabinoids in marijuana are responsible for interacting with the brain and body through cellular receptors and chemical interactions, while terpenoids are essential oils which give marijuana its smell and flavor. The two main phytocannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which causes intoxication and is what gives the individual the state of euphoria, and cannabidiol (CBD) which has potentially therapeutic benefits. THC levels have been increasing in cannabis as growers attempt to create hybrids of the substance with an increased THC concentration. Low doses are associated with the reduction of anxiety and stress, while high doses may have ""psychotomimetic"" adverse effects such as increased anxiety and levels of paranoia. Otherwise, CBD is not euphoric and has medicinal benefits associated with reduced pain or nausea and the potential to prevent seizures and relieve migraines. Marijuana is a specific variety of cannabis which contains more than 0.3% THC by weight. Cannabis varieties that contain less than 0.3% THC by weight are classified as hemp or a cannabidiol product. There are several forms of cannabis: Sativa plants, with their thin and tall structure, take longer to mature. They typically have low doses of CBD and high doses of THC. This ratio creates the feeling of being stuck and can reduce anxiety and stress while increasing creativity and focus when consumed. Indica plants have more physical than mental effects on the body. Given a higher dose of CBD and myrcene, this marijuana strain helps with sleep and relaxes or calms the muscles in individuals experiencing anxiety or insomnia. Sativa and indica combinations are classified into three categories. The first type has a high THC dose, the second type is the most common and has a hybrid of THC and CBD, and the third type has a high CBD dose. Although THC and CBD are the main phytocannabinoids, others include cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), and cannabigerol (CBG). CBN can calm the symptoms of neurological conditions such as epilepsy or seizures. THCA may be able to reduce arthritis, autoimmune inflammation, and symptoms of conditions such as Parkinson's and ALS. THCA acts similarly to THC minus the psychoactive effects that give a person a euphoric state associated with marijuana use. Finally, CBG is believed to reduce symptoms of depression, PTSD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. A general rule of thumb is that marijuana with a CBD to THC ratio of 80:20 is best suited for beginners and one can progress to one. 50:50 or 1:1 ratio once you become more comfortable with the potent psychoactive effects. Specifically, marijuana strains more suitable for beginners include sativa-dominant Blue Dream, high-CBD Cannatonic or Harlequin, and Hindu Kush and. Northern Lights are both indica dominant. Each variety has a terpene balance, which causes different effects in different varieties. More recently, some studies are determining that terpenes can significantly influence the body with the use of marijuana in a positive way. Some chemical compounds found in different marijuana strains include bisabolol, caryophyllene, mycenae, pinene, terpinene, limonene, and eucalyptol. The effect or absorption of marijuana after consuming an edible contrasts greatly with the effect of smoking a marijuana joint. When taking an edible, absorption begins in the salivary glands under the tongue, so it is not necessary to swallow an edible for it to take effect. If ingested, the chemical content of the food passes through the liver before a binding effect is perceived. Absorption can take 30 to 60 minutes before reaching the brain when marijuana is ingested. The effects appear more gradually, but last much longer. Smoking a joint or bong, on the other hand, allows a person to feel the effects of THC or intoxication more quickly. However, the almost immediate effect comes at a cost, as smoking marijuana is linked to adverse effects on respiratory health. The reported set of risks associated with smoking marijuana is very similar to the consequences of smoking tobacco, including airway inflammation, barotrauma (tissue damage due to compressive and expansive forces that cause shear stress, and excessive stretching of tissue in the breasts). paranasal or lungs) and obstructive lung problems. Other ways to take marijuana include tinctures (alcohol), vaping, and topicals (lotions or oils). Both medical and recreational marijuana do not have a significant difference in the dose of THC and the variety of marijuana provided. The main distinction between the two categories is that people seeking to purchase marijuana for medical purposes must be licensed and approved by a health care provider in the state, while anyone at least 21 years old can purchase recreational marijuana. There is still insufficient data on the long-lasting and overall health effects of potent marijuana, as well as on the different strains of the product. In the short term, marijuana is an addictive substance. According to the American Addiction Centers, “about 14.2 million people, ages 12 and older, struggled with marijuana addiction in 2020.” The National Institution on Drug Abuse determined that marijuana dependence or addiction occurs ""when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug by reducing production and sensitivity to its own endocannabinoid neurotransmitters."" Therefore, an individual could develop marijuana use disorders if they do not control their use or consumption of marijuana. Marijuana poses psychological risks. It can have consequences such as poor memory, muscle coordination and paranoia. It can have negative effects such as poor immunity, cancer, memory impairment, and long-term heart or lung complications. For these reasons, it is crucial to be cautious and responsible when consuming marijuana for medical or recreational use. Conclusions from marijuana use. It is always valuable to weigh the possible beneficial and adverse effects of consuming or smoking different varieties of marijuana. For now informed marijuana users, have fun while staying safe!

So here is a list of the ideal group to smoke. KIM LE / DAILY NEXUS Paquita la del Barrio: Paquita, the icon that you are. I grew up listening to Two-Legged Rat, feeling all the pain she felt. I mean, ""Venomous snake, waste of life, I hate you and despise you""?? I felt his resentment, his passion, all at the tender age of 10. What is it to say that I wouldn't have the power to raise the faucet I put on today? Dr. Ana Maria Polo: ""Your name is not MOON!"" Queen. Completely. Dr. Ana Maria Polo would definitely be a great addition to our circle. Fair and intelligent, what more can I ask for? She would make me feel safe and because she was safe she would never skip my turn. Humanitarian, judge, presenter, referee, actress and singer ""“What can't she do?? Marco Antonio Solis: Where are we going? There is Marco Antonio Solis, really, where? Well I don't know, but I know If I go with him I will definitely have fun. I think Mr. Bukis would sing to me if for some reason I get nervous. El So-and-So: According to my mom, So-and-so is going to pressure me to smoke. Make it free, put pressure on me. What if I just look for a friend? Also, you taught me not to be afraid of new experiences and to be nice to people. Let me call Ludovico and Federica P. Luche: Although I think they're stingy. Their lifestyle speaks for itself. And maybe they also have access to refined pot, though, I think I'll have to pay for it myself. Oscar Isaac: This is just for me. most formative part of my childhood. Every day at 4pm, before I left for my swimming practice, they filled me in on the gossip, entertained me, really got me ready to face the world alone. Lili Estefan and Raul de Molina, my favorite television presenters, would bring a thousand laughs and lucrative gossip. What more can I ask for? The Nuns of La Iglesia San Malaquías: Listen to me, I know what you're thinking but give me a second to explain. When I was little I went to Catholic school and the nuns were my friends for life!! They always had answers to my questions, and they treated me with great affection. One session with them and my world would be complete. I believe I will come away with the true knowledge of peace. Gregor Samsa: In the form of a cockroach, of course. I think I would benefit from talking to him, especially with the magic toke. I need to understand it intimately, without barriers. How did it feel to be in an insect's body? Talk to me about the insignificance and inconsistency of life, about my purpose in this world, about what we owe to others and to ourselves, but if that doesn't interest you, just tell me, how did you get out of bed? Group of my pot smoking nightmares If I find myself in the position of having to endure a session with these, I will tear my hair out. Yolanda: #AnythingforSelenas Are you free on March 20, 2025? Yes? I hope so because Yolanda could be released and we need to be ready. It seems to me like someone who pinches the joint and leaves saliva. Old pig! Olivia from On my Block: ""If anyone says anything else I'm going to punch them in the mouth."" My boss is telling me that she had to write more but I'm more stuck than shit. Besides, I don't think I have to explain myself. Gina Rodriguez: She had a chance to stand out with her show Jane the Virgin and she still managed to ruin that. Do you remember ""mama let's investigation""? Because I do. How about that video? Mmmhmmm. Fuck you, I like you, fat girl. Maybe he'll call me an insult with the past tense as a joke because we're both Latinas JLo: Look, I won't deny that JLo made history when she played Selena. But, there's something about her that I just don't like. Who wouldn't want to share the stage with Shakira? Just like James K. Polk, they would take away my churrito. Kendall Jenner: First he puts on a peasant costume, the appropriation of Mexican culture, and now he colonizes Benito. What will this family end up with? own? It's time to say enough, and to hell with the colonizing gringos. Please, Benito, come home. Look at me, this is not you. How can you change your mind about El Apagón? colors

la-vista,"América unida ""“ El dí­a Panamericano","United America ""“ Pan American Day","Pan American Day marks the day the International Union of the Americas was formed. The idea was proposed during the Congress of Panama in 1826 by José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar. On April 14, 1890 in Washington, DC, the action of uniting the countries of North and South America was implemented at the First International Conference of American States. This date had also given rise to the idea of ​​the Organization of American States (O.A.S.), which was then established in April 1948. In addition to creating the O.A.S., the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man was approved during the same conference. This document became the first human rights document in the world. President Herbert Hoover declared the first official National Pan American Day on April 14, 1931. In 2015, former President Barack Obama proclaimed April 14 as National Pan American Day. Since 1931, 34 American nations, including the United States and countries in Latin and South America, had marked the occasion with parades, art exhibitions, musical performances, and food to commemorate the alliance of the Americas. The Los Angeles Philharmonic has recently launched an online program where the orchestra performs several pieces in honor of Pan American Day. Its program includes music by Cuban-born composer Tania León, Venezuelan cellist and composer Paul Desenne and ballet composer Aaron Copland. More information about the program can be found at the following link: www.soundstage.laphil.com/a-pan-american-musical-feast/. Recipes in honor of Pan American Day emphasize the importance of spices for flavor. To celebrate the various parts of the Americas, there are a variety of dishes that can be prepared. Some recipes include, but are not limited to: Enchiladas de Guadalajara from Mexico, Eggplant with Tomato from Costa Rica, Coconut Tarts from the Dominican Republic, and Whipped Avocado from Brazil. Each recipe is made with ingredients or a cooking style that are specific to each country. The first two dishes are savory and made from flavorful ingredients like sweet peppers, tomatoes, and onions. These vegetables, along with corn, plantains, and beans, are essential in most Latin and South American cuisines. The third and fourth courses are desserts. The coconut tarts highlight the combination of cottage cheese and coconut, and the whipped avocado accentuates the richness of the sweetened avocado, which is similar in consistency and flavor to a modern avocado mousse. Each recipe has a different meaning in Latin American and South American culture. These recipes were compiled from a New York Times newspaper that was published on April 13, 1950, the day before Pan American Day. The newspaper included a diversity of recipes from other countries in South America and Latin America to emphasize a value of Pan American Day: respect and celebrate the culture and traditions of other American nations. In addition to music and food, Pan American Day is celebrated with gatherings and parades. This year, Central Park in New York City is hosting a virtual Pan American Day program where you can see monuments dedicated to Latin American heroes at the park's Sixth Avenue entrances and experience a virtual walk through the south end of Central Park . This event takes place a few days before Pan American Day, on Wednesday, April 12, via Zoom. To register, click on this following link: www.centralparknyc.org/activities/events/pan-american-day-in-central-park. Pan American Day parades are another way to celebrate. In 2022, a large Pan American parade and street festival were held in Oklahoma City. The streets were filled with Hispanic music and dance performances. The festival generated attention to Hispanic traditions and cultural heritage. The Fiestas de Las Americas took place around the time Belize celebrates Pan American Day, October 12. This day is generally celebrated as Columbus Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day in the United States. Written and translated by Meenakshi Manoj"
la-vista,MCC alberga a la profesora auxiliar de UCLA Ugo Edu para discusión sobre la antropologí­a y el teatro,MCC Hosts UCLA Assistant Professor Ugo Edu for Discussion on Anthropology and Theater,"The UC Santa Barbara MultiCultural Center hosted assistant professor and medicinal anthropologist Ugo Edu on February 13 for an online discussion about anthropology and theater and their connections to Black life, health, history, and culture. ""Forecasting through Anthropology and Theater for Black Life"" focuses on the scientific history of Blackness and how anthropology and theater can be used to promote awareness of Black issues and generally create visibility for members. Black community members. The event, ""part of the MultiCultural Center's (MCC) La Raza Importa series,"" was delayed from November 17, 2022, to the winter quarter in solidarity with the UAW strike. MCC office manager and interim program director Jesse Avila introduced Edu as a ""medical anthropologist who works at the intersection of medicinal anthropology, public health, Black feminism, science, technology, and societal studies."" Edu focuses on reproductive and sexual health, gender, race, aesthetics, body awareness and body modification, Avila said. Edu began his presentation with a dialogue of his work and described it as ""within the contexts of an economy of aesthetics, race and sexuality."" Edu wrote the work while working on his dissertation on voluntary tubal ligations ""“ the cutting of the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy ""“ in Brazil. The specific scene you read follows a woman's effort to receive tubal ligation from a doctor who pressures her to instead take the path of having vaginal plastic surgery. Although the work is fictional, Edu said it was inspired by the stories he heard from testimonials from several women. COURTESY OF THE UCLA DEPARTMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES ""I wrote about what some women told me had happened to them or others. They were only able to secure a tubal ligation after consenting to vaginal plastic surgery. Some were even unsure if the plastic surgery actually happened,"" Edu said. ""I started creating some ideas in my head of scenes and the story I want to tell. I want it to be something that disturbs audiences and unleashes them to take action."" Edu talked about the reactions he has received about his work, and how One audience member focused on access to plastic surgery by having unwanted surgery being performed on an individual. ""My work left white women [focused] on the impossibility of accessing vaginal plastic surgery as if that were on the same level as having to accept the surgery that one was not looking for, in order to access the one that was needed, "" Edu said. Edu then read another scene from his play about an airport officer who interrogated a woman and her daughter, ultimately detaining the woman on suspicion that they left the country for ""holiday break,"" a process in which the parents will carry out daughters to another country where restrictions on certain vaginal surgeries are not as strict. ""The revelation of this evasion justifies increased surveillance and monitoring of particular demographic data at both airports and schools,"" Edu said. Edu spoke about a workshop that took place at the San Francisco International Airport where participants were taught how to identify those at risk of vacation cuts. ""What is most at stake is the lives of women and girls who will be subject to this increased surveillance, search, observation, pricking, touching, study and examination of their bodies,"" Edu said. Edu is planning to finish his work and is currently working on a new project that focuses on body modifications in Nigeria. Edu said that the new project, ""attempts to situate old and new ideals and modify practices within the constellation of aesthetics, health, technology and cultural influences that are local, regional, continental and diasporic."" He expressed concern about maintaining a balance between promoting its investigation and protect the safety of those with whom you work. ""Part of what worries me constantly about this project is how to work creatively behind my encounters in ways that do not further endanger the lives of Nigerian women, and sometimes men and other Black people, around the world who can be involved,"" she said. Edu further discussed how the popularity of body modifications such as Brazilian butt lifts ““a process that transfers fat from the body to the buttocks”“ has given rise to critical discourse on the ethics and impacts of body modifications. “The way the [Brazilian butt lift] era of BBL in the US, specifically, has opened up scrutiny and claims of expertise in reading bodies is something that interests me,” she said. ""I'm hesitant to give more people and reasons for people to look at and reflect on and objectify Black women's bodies, but I think the forgotten or neglected areas of what happens to users of body modification techniques that don't include BBLs maybe it's good to watch and create attention behind the theater."" Edu spoke about the importance of understanding the vulnerability of Black people to medical and health advances, emphasizing the historical precedent of Black women operated on without consent as a justification for the development of modern medicine. ""Also at stake is how we have come to know and position ourselves behind medical and health advances, surveillance and norms and we must not forget the role that Black people, with emphasis on women, have played without consent of the development of modern medicine and knowledge of our bodies,"" Edu said. Edu ended his discussion by talking about his hopes for the future and morals of his work. She also highlighted the importance of making the world more “livable,” particularly for Black women. ""I guess we ended up hoping to do something that disrupts who we think we are, how we think we are, something that leaves us uncomfortable but not so much about the topic at hand, whether it's tubal ligations or female genital modification,"" Edu said . ""But, about how we come to feel about the thing in question and what we do with the possible future before us."" ""We must go and do the work to change our world into something more livable for all of us, especially for the Black women, because when it is livable for Black women, it will be livable for all of us.""

la-vista,"IVRPD alberga segunda ""˜Forward Ever Backward Never""™ celebración con organizaciones Negras en UCSB","IVRPD Hosts Second ""˜Forward Ever Backward Never'™ Celebration with Black Organizations at UCSB","The Isla Vista Park and Recreation District hosted its second annual “Forward Ever Backward Never” celebration on February 28 at the community center in Isla Vista to conclude Black History Month. The event was in collaboration with the Student Association (A.S.) Commission for Culture, Art and Joy Justice (CCAJJ), the Black Student Union (BSU), Arts I.V. and the Office of Black Student Development (OBSD). was primarily sponsored by the Community Relations Commission, an A.S. commission that works to fund groups on and off campus who work to improve I.V. Graduate student in the UCSB education department and CCAJJ co-chair Charlene Macharia addressed the celebration calling for intercultural alliance. She said that many spaces calling for intercultural alliance base it on “mourning” or “anger,” and that it is important to celebrate each other as well “When there is a call for alliance, it is. about something that happened and it's usually in times of mourning or anger,"" he said. ""But I think it's unique that we're actually calling for a celebration and I think that's when a lot of barriers are broken."" ""We just see each other as human beings worthy of joy, worthy of existing and being [a] community,"" Macharia continued in place of the event. ""We're just coming, doing human things, eating together, listening to music and I think that's powerful."" The celebration, which was originally held at Little Acorn Park and changed due to weather conditions, began with a recognition of the land, a performance and speech by Chumash community member Aleqwel Mendoza, who performed the traditional ""swordfish song,"" which represents life, spoke about the history of the Chumash people and land, and ended with a ""welcome song."" ""It's our history before history,"" Mendoza said in an interview with the Nexus about land recognition. “It's really exciting because it actually creates a recognition that we exist.” Third-year economics student Michelle Ohwobete then sang, “Lift Every Voice and Sing” written by James Weldon Johnson ““ a song historically used as an anthem for the pride and Black Strike. The event then transitioned to the first group performance of the night with The Rahka""™s a reggae and soul band who were invited back after performing for ""Forward Ever Backward Never"" last year. The group performed a list of songs nostalgic for Black culture, including Nina Simone's ""Feeling Good"" and music by Bob Marley. ""We are all for the community, and if you look at the cast of my band, we represent the four corners of the earth,"" The Rahka's band member Alla Rahka Mckeon said in an interview with the nexus. ""We chose a list of songs that speak to a lot of people and strike a familiar chord with them."" During The Rahka's performance, planning members served soul food prepared by BSU members and individuals from other groups involved to guests, including chicken wings and macaroni and cheese. The event also featured spoken word poetry, a DJ set by BSU President and fourth-year chemistry student Ethan George, and a panel discussion with Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies Professor and Director of the Collections Repository Archaeological and Ethnographic, Gerardo Aldana. The celebration concluded with a screening of the film “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” Sophomore statistics and data science and African American studies double major and event attendee Zoe McCullough said she loved the nostalgia and community feeling from this year's ""Forward Ever Backward Never"" event. ""It feels like a cookout, it feels like a block party,""™ he said. “There's good music, there's soul food, it feels like a welcoming environment.” Towela Phiri, a sophomore computer science student and event attendee, emphasized that events like this recognize the Black student population while celebrating the existence of community. ""I think it's important to recognize all the students we have on campus, especially the black students, who are minorities,"" he said. ""It's good to acknowledge our existence and come together to celebrate each other."" McCullough echoed Phiri's sentiment and said that the black narrative has historically been driven by trauma and hardship, so it is imperative to have events that are Focus on black joy and progress. ""I feel like a lot of what is understood about the black narrative in America is based on trauma. We don't really celebrate how smart we are, how creative we are, what we can do when we come together as a community,"" she said. CCAJJ co-president Charlene Macharia performs spoken word poetry for the crowd. EUNICE LAI / DAILY NEXUS Last year, the Isla Vista Parks and Recreation District (IVRPD) only collaborated with OBSD for the “Forward Ever Backward Never” event, but IVRPD Coordinator Sophia Lake said it was important to organizers to include a variety of organizations with this year's celebration. “This year, we really wanted to reach out to other Black organizations, as well as get more planning and more creative minds into the planning process,” Lake said. Fourth-year sociology student and BSU Interim Development Coordinator Kylah Jordan said the expansion of the celebration this year reflects the importance of having representatives from a variety of Black entities for an event honoring Black History Month. ""I think it's very significant for us to have representatives of those Black organizations there and helping with the planning, incorporating their ideas, whatever the case may be,"" Jordan said. ""I do think this year will be more meaningful, much more memorable."" Macharia said the expansion of this year's celebration spans across cultures with the incorporation of indigenous people into the event calendar. He spoke about racial groups who historically allied with each other in America and the importance of having meetings which create unity between the Black community and other minorities. ""Black history is world history, all of our stories intertwined. It did not happen in a vacuum,"" Macharia said. ""We should celebrate the contribution of Black people while also recognizing the allyship."" ""It is time for the United States to really break out of those boxes and really work together to recognize and honor the contribution of indigenous peoples, the different enslaved Africans who were brought here,"" he continued. Noting the extremely small population of Black students at UCSB, Jordan said this event is also to encourage community between Black students and Black staff. ""The Black student population at UCSB is only 4%, so we do have a small population,"" she said. “This event is to bring black staff who can learn and recognize Isla Vista since many of them travel and don't really come to Isla Vista and really look around.” Jordan said this event will hopefully create stronger relationships between the entities involved to promote future collaborations. ""It's just a time where we all come together at a big event and really enjoy black culture and express it with other people who also enjoy it,"" he said. McCullough expressed his hope that this event would help showcase the strength of the Black community and that Black History Month would not be the only month of the year to celebrate Black achievements, joy, pride and progress. ""It's really nice to be able to come together and see people who look like you and who really have a sense of community,"" he said. “It's really important to close out Black History Month because it's really the only calendar month of the year where we're treated a little bit better.” “We're not going anywhere, and we're also essential to America,” McCullough continued .

la-vista,Simple Dicho: ¿Que tan poderoso es ChatGPT?,Simple Said: How powerful is ChatGPT?,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, online learning has tempted students to abandon academic integrity. Some familiar programs include Photomath, Quizlet, and Socratic, which are designed to help students with problematic work problems and help them study for the next big exam. Although the creators may have good intentions when creating these programs, they can easily be seen as a major threat to academic honesty. Technology is quickly becoming more present in today's educational system; A big shift is seen as many grading systems convert to the almighty Canvas, a program where you can communicate with anyone in school, view grades, take tests, complete assignments, and plan your schedule. A big question that teachers and administrators ask is “How can we prevent students from cheating?” A remotely assigned exam can be taken with the help of our phones that never leave the palm of our hands. Another approach is to participate in a FaceTime call, making an individual test a group effort. Plus, there are tablet devices, physical notes, and new Google Tabs that are ready to help when needed. As we become even more reliant on technology, a new artificial intelligence (AI) system has attracted a lot of attention. It is known as ChatGPT. ESME PUZIO / DAILY NEXUS So what is ChatGPT? It stands for Generative Chat Pre-Entry Transformer. According to Techopedia, this intricate program works on machine learning algorithms, which is designed to recognize patterns and rules. Technopedia explains how learning algorithms produce learning models that can be applied to data and generate predictions. Technopedia reports that ChatGPT has been trained on a large amount of network data before the year 2022, and with this source of information, the program can perform the natural language generation (GLN) task with higher accuracy. GLN tasks are a subcategory of artificial intelligence and use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and summarize it in a way that looks like a human wrote it. As a conversational chatbot, the goal is to simulate a human conversation. What is so unique about this program is its power to quickly produce custom essays, resumes, solutions to math problems and general answers to any question or command. Every time you have a question or a command, ChatGPT can provide results in the most efficient way. What are the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT? According to writer Maxwell Timothy of MakeUseOf, this program can provide creative and original jokes, songs, and stories. Along with your creative skills, you can answer intricate questions related to topics like dark matter and can even help frustrated students with complicated math problems. A skeptic would expect simple one-line answers, but ChatGPT impresses audiences by being able to write full essays in seconds. Although the program is highly capable, there are limitations to its capacity. According to OpenAI (a nonprofit artificial intelligence research organization that was co-founded by Elon Musk in 2015), ChatGPT was found to ""write answers that sound plausible but incorrect or nonsensical. The model is often overly detailed and abuses certain phrases."" The program is constantly modified to improve performance. A critical issue that OpenAI analyzes is when the chatbot responds to inappropriate questions. In response to these questions, AI trainers are working to have the model reject such requests, but ""sometimes it will respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior."" ChatGPT has its flaws, but it is also a revolutionary creation in terms of the previous AI chatbot. What does this mean for students applying to college, taking tests, writing essays, and completing graded assignments in general? In New York City, the department of education has banned ChatGPT on all devices and networks in its public schools. A department spokeswoman, Jenna Lyle, said the ban was based on ""concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns about the security and accuracy of content."" Another issue that arises is that ChatGPT can motivate students to plagiarize and therefore inhibit the learning process and the growth of critical thinking skills. On the other hand, ChatGPT provides opportunities to learn more about artificial intelligence and this new era of complex technology. Teachers and administrators are trying to find ways to work with ChatGPT without compromising students' education. Dan Lewer, an educator, proposed a solution to require students to submit videos verbally explaining their essays to verify authenticity and develop communication skills. The education system is trying to figure out how to live with ChatGPT, and that can possibly result in more changes to the way we learn and write. What should we do? ChatGPT is foreign waters. There is a possibility that more school systems will regulate or even ban use of the program. ChatGPT is entertaining to interact with and makes one even more curious about its capabilities. The program can help us generate ideas whenever we feel stuck in the creative department, but it can easily become very dangerous when we plagiarize and claim work that was produced by a computer as our own. As realistic as the results are for human-made products, the differentiation of authentic human thoughts and ChatGPT becomes more questionable and blurred.

""We have tried to ask for fair wages and were not taken seriously, so we are officially asking for raises to sign this petition,"" said the demand letter obtained by Nexus. ""We want $17.00 an hour for cashiers and cashiers who are training. $18.00 per hour for cooks and cooks who are training, $18.50 for change leaders who are training and $20 per hour for change leaders, for the next pay period and a $0.50 increase at each beginning of the year."" Salaries will represent an increase of many dollars from the minimum pay saved by cashiers and less than $17 an hour for non-management positions, according to one of the employees. Employees reported to Nexus that the issue of pay increases was raised. often but managers suddenly dismissed the topic.

la-vista,La campaña Oportunidades para Todos aboga qué UC contrate estudiantes indocumentados,Opportunities for All campaign advocates for UC to hire undocumented students,"University of California undocumented student organizers and UC Los Angeles immigration law experts are spearheading the Opportunity for All Campaign, advocating for the University of California to hire undocumented students on all nine campuses. The campaign was launched in October 2022, following a final Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ruling that prohibited new applications from being processed. The campaign was led by the Chain Led by Undocumented Students ""“ a coalition of undocumented students behind the UC system ""“ with support from professors from the UCLA School of Law's Center for Immigration Law and Policy (CILP) and the Center UCLA Labor. CILP argues that the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, which prohibits undocumented immigrants without work permits from legal employment, does not apply to certain state entities, including UC. ""CILP's analysis demonstrates that as an arm of the state, the University of California faces no legal restrictions on hiring undocumented workers,"" an Oct. 19 statement read. CILP faculty wrote a memo detailing the legal theory and submitted it to the UC as a proposal, along with a public signature letter and a letter to Michael V. Drake, asking for his support. ""As law professors with considerable experience in immigration law, we write primarily to state that we believe that the legal basis for hiring undocumented students among UC, as described in the attached memorandum, is sound,"" the co-chairs of the Faculty of CILP, Hiroshi Motomura and Ahilan Arulanantham said in the letter. Ryan King, Associate Director of Media Relations for the UC Office of the President, said the proposal is currently under review, and UC has not yet adopted any plan for its implementation. ""The University of California is certainly committed to supporting our undocumented students. These are complex issues that deserve careful and thoughtful consideration, including the potential impacts and legal risks to the university and our undocumented students,"" King said in a statement. with Nexus. “We are reviewing the proposal and are in the process of determining appropriate next steps.” Third-year UCLA student studying Chicano and Central American Studies and Labor Studies double major and co-president of the UCLA undocumented student organization Improving Dreams, Equity and Access (I.D.E.A.S.) Jeffry Umaña Muñoz said he was hired last summer to lead the campaign's organizing efforts along with other student leaders. ""During the summer of 2022, we began to create a plan on how we could mobilize undocumented students and undocumented alliances behind the state of California and other organizations to advance this campaign and pressure the Regents to hire undocumented students,"" Umaña Muñoz said . The campaign launched this fall, with a series of classes and workshops on several UC campuses, although it has not yet expanded to UC Santa Barbara, Umaña Muñoz said. The group has since advocated for the cause at the January UC Regents meeting and plans to hold a statewide week of action during Week 8 of Winter Quarter 2023. While the proposal continues to undergo evaluation for the UC, Umaña Muñoz emphasized the legal validity of the theory and expressed hope in the campaign. """"Not once was our legal theory questioned. Not once did the UC President's Office or the Board of Regents or the General Counsel's Office question the soundness of our legal theory,"" said Umaña Muñoz. He emphasized the need for UC to comply with the proposal to provide support for undocumented students in their system. ""Students are suffering right now, and UC hides behind this blanket statement of being afraid of what others will do to us when they have the power and authority to protect us regardless of what happens, "" he said.

la-vista,Simple Dicho: Cual es la mejor forma de tomar Cafeí­na,Simple Said: What is the best way to take Caffeine,"With final exams approaching, caffeine is the official sponsor of long nights of studying. So, what should you drink to stay focused? LUCA DISBROW / DAILY NEXUS In the United States, 85% of the adult population drinks caffeine daily, ingesting 135 milligrams per day (1 standard cup is 8 fluid ounces or 235 milliliters). The human body absorbs up to 99% of the caffeine in a cup of coffee, allowing the compound to reach maximum concentration levels in the bloodstream as soon as 15 minutes after consumption. Once absorbed, caffeine crosses the blood-brain barrier and blocks the inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine, making us feel a boost of alertness and instant energy. A daily cup of coffee not only makes you feel more energetic, it also burns fat, improves physical performance, and reduces the risk of several diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cancer. Studies Scientists suggest that coffee may even increase longevity: Two large observational studies reported by Healthline Media revealed that coffee is associated with a 20% reduced risk of death in men and 26% in women ages 18 to 24. But the. Coffee has a strong competitor: caffeinated tea. We'll look at two popular alternatives, starting with matcha. Coffee contains between 90 and 95 milligrams of caffeine per serving, while matcha contains between 38 and 88 milligrams of caffeine per serving. matcha contains less caffeine, it lasts much longer in the body. The small amounts of caffeine in matcha take longer to enter the bloodstream lasting up to six hours. As a result, the ""crash"" one feels after an hour or two. drinking a cup of coffee does not happen with matcha. The main explanation for this revolves around the amino acid L-theanine, which acts with other antioxidants, flavonoids and phytonutrients to slow the body's absorption of caffeine, resulting in a gentle introduction of caffeine into the system and a prolonged period of insomnia. L-theanine stimulates the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that makes us feel happy and can reduce stress and improve mood by lowering blood pressure, reducing cortisol levels and increasing alpha waves in the brain. Abundant in the phytochemical EGCG, matcha has thermogenic properties that increase fat metabolism and help promote weight loss. Unlike coffee, matcha contains antibacterial properties that leave your mouth fresh and your teeth clean. Yerba mate infusion, one of the most popular drinks at UC Santa Barbara, is another tea-based coffee alternative. With 85 milligrams of caffeine per cup, yerba mate contains less caffeine than coffee but more than a regular cup of tea. Like matcha, yerba mate takes a while to introduce caffeine to the body's system, but it lasts longer in the system and avoids the jitters and crashes that coffee gives. Known as ""the drink of the gods"", yerba mate is full of antioxidants; While coffee and matcha are also known for their high antioxidant content, yerba mate surpasses both with 24 different vitamins and minerals, 15 antioxidant-rich amino acids, and 196 volatile chemicals. Preliminary scientific studies have shown that yerba mate can help stimulate fat oxidation and feelings of satiety, leading to weight loss. Its anti-inflammatory compounds reduce markers of inflammation and help prevent colon cancer, urinary tract infections, and kidney stones. Either way, caffeine should be consumed in moderation for it to have the best effect. If you are looking for a quick boost, coffee will be the best option. However, matcha and yerba mate are the best alternatives to maintain long-term energy. Written by: Audrey Moeller Translated by: Chiloé Spelius"

You arrive, hungry, with eyes the color of roses in the spring, and You look with pleasure at the dinner that the family prepared. At the end of a wonderful dinner, you turn your head towards your aunt, who is carrying the bagel and suddenly the twenty hits you: it is January 6, Three Kings Day. That's why the family got together!"", you think. Your previously dry mouth is watering and as your eyes follow the approaching donut, you realize that your mother is looking at you with the intensity that only a mother can procreate. Next, you understand what that look means, ""If for some reason, if by the grace of God you get that damned, helpless, choking danger in the form of baby Jesus, you and only you, You will be in charge of cooking all the tamales for Candlemas Day."" The one whose turn it is to have baby Jesus will have a bigger headache, since that unfortunate person must be in charge of making some food, typically tamales, and offering his house for the celebration. on February 2, or Candlemas Day. That day the presentation of baby Jesus is celebrated but it also has indigenous roots since tamales are symbolic of a blessing from the Gods in the form of rain and an abundant harvest.

la-vista,Simplemente dicho: ¿La vida es una simulación?,Simply put: Is life a simulation?,"Conflict dominates life, through dialogues about ethics, beliefs, socio-economic constructs and more. However, a less discussed aspect of our existence is our reality in general. Almost all of us agree that what we touch, smell, and interact with physically makes up the real world. Anyway, a series of strange and inexplicable phenomena have begun to accumulate among our world. Whether eyewitness accounts, personal experiences, or documented phenomena, the idea that our own reality is a computer simulation has increased in recent years. Such feelings have been consolidated as beliefs, implying that certain aspects of our world appear identical to what we might identify as an artificial construct. These beliefs have coalesced into what is known as ""simulation theory."" Elaborated by technology writer Mike Thomas, ""Since it entered popular consciousness, many have noted that simulation theory is essentially an offshoot of the story of Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"" from the ancient Greek philosopher's book."" ˜The Republic""™, and René Descartes' evil demon hypothesis from the French philosopher and scientist's ""First Meditation""™. Both contain ruminations on perception and the nature of being ""“head-breaking and continually provocative themes” . AUDREY KENYON / THE DAILY NEXUS Without uniform, the most popular iteration of simulation theory dictates the idea that humanity is simply strands of code in a great and unknown computer program which invisibly dictates our lives. The genius behind our artificial existence may not be what humanity usually identifies as ""God."" Instead of an ancient wise figure or unknown cosmic entity, our very existence may be determined by a scoundrel. New York University philosophy professor David Chalmers describes the higher power responsible for this hyper-realistic simulation as a ""programmer of the next universe,"" perhaps one whom we somehow regard as a god, though not necessarily. in the traditional context. ""[They] may just be a teenager,"" Chalmers said, ""hacking into a computer and running five universes in the background. But maybe it's someone who is nonetheless omniscient, all-knowing and all-powerful."" about our world."" The idea that our lives could be a sordid byproduct of a curious teenager's coding seems to induce a sense of existential nihilism. Why exceed expectations if the entirety of your life's work remains a simple code artifice in someone else's grand design? As Scientific American's Fouad Khan writes, the lives we command can be a medium of pleasures that our boss, or bosses, use for their audiovisual stimulation. ""There you have it. The simplest explanation for the existence of consciousness is that it is an experience created for our bodies, but not for us. We are qualia-generating machines,"" Khan said. ""As Grand Theft Auto characters, we exist to create integrated audiovisual media. Also, like Grand Theft Auto characters, our product is perhaps for the benefit of someone experiencing our life behind ourselves."" Qualia is in essence, a general term that describes how humans physically, mentally and emotionally perceive the world around them. If in fact our experiences are nothing more than the byproduct of an incomprehensible machination, it would be necessary to replicate certain qualities, such as taste, smell or emotion. Regardless of whether our every move is dictated for the benefit of someone else, we will still rest tonight and wake up tomorrow to go to class or work. We will still eat, breathe, interact with others, and perform all the needs expected of a socially integrated human being. Our senses, our sight, smell, touch, and how they interact with the world around us, provide a sense of reality sufficient to persist. The implications of the strong possibility that life is a work of quantum computing and digitization may simply be to recognize and move on. Scientific American says it best: ""And yet this utter helplessness, this perfect deception offers us no way out in its revelation. All we can do is come to terms with the reality of the simulation and do what we can. Here on earth. In this life."""

There are so many examples of infidelity in the industry such as Jay-Z, Gabriel Soto, Vicente Fernandez and even the singer-songwriter of ""No me dio perdido"", Juanes. Unfortunately for us, the Latin community does not talk much about infidelity and even supports the forgiveness of unfaithful people. However, my boss doesn't know how to read Spanish and YHLQMDLG (I do whatever I want). Sharing the same sentiment, Shakira, Colombian singer-songwriter, “woman of the year” and “queen of Latin music”, cut the dead weight and is reportedly living her best life. Shakira, as a Latina woman and woman in STEM, used her forensic talents to prove that Pique was cheating on her. And worse ""“ in her own house. Seeing that her cup of strawberry jam was almost empty, and knowing that she was the only one in the house who ate it, she just connected the dots and we found out that her hips don't lie but her husband's dog did. After this news broke, the Spanish government had to take extreme measures to calm the tensions accumulated behind the oceans. They sent to seduce Rauw Alejandro, a reggaeton player from Puerto Rico named as the ""king."" of modern reggaeton."" The seductress? None other than the famous Rosalía. Miss Rosalía entered the scene in 2017 when she earned a nomination for a Grammy and in March 2022 when we were all trying to figure out what was happening saying in her song, ""Bizcochito"". Our reports tell us that they sent her by wooden horse but after popular opinion, they changed their strategy and sent her by DM on Instagram in such a way, whether it was her flamenco movements or her voice. Powerful, Rosalía has conquered Rauw's heart and at the same time, disappointed the hopes of many Rauw fans. Spain has conquered the Latins once again but the important thing is that Shakira is safe and sound while the entire world is against Piqué. They suffered the same penalty when in September 2022, they accused her of fraud due to tax evasion, but as we well know, those hips don't lie. She sings about these issues in her latest single, a collaboration with Bizarrap, which is generating a lot of buzz, demonstrating the power of Latin America.

The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTB) also plans to offer two new routes: Line 19x, an express route connecting the city of Carpinteria (the east side of Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College). Hillary Blackerby, Santa Barbara's (MTD) planning and marketing manager, provided an overview of the proposed service changes at the Community Services District (IVCSD) board meeting on April 25. Blackerby said Line 28 stops at UCSB, Calle El Colegio, Residencia Santa Catalina, Calle Phelps, and Camino Real Marketplace has constant demand from the community not only from the campus, but also from overcrowding on the buses. “We know there is extreme demand on this route,” Blackerby said at the meeting. ""We use 60-foot articulated buses on Line 28. They carry more than 100 people per load. They are always full, and we have to turn people away."" Before the pandemic, buses arrived at each stop every 10""“ 12 minutes. The line was suspended with the COVID-19 campus closure and then returned in the fall quarter of 2021 at a reduced operating level, with an interval of 36 minutes between bus arrivals. Santa Barbara MTD is exploring options to restore headways to every 18 minutes for eight hours of the day, depending on bus driver availability “We know the demand is there and we need to bring more service.” Blackerby said. The introduction of Line 19x would be the first new bus route since Line 28 in 2015, according to Blackerby MTD plans to offer the line as a weekday express service during transit work hours. seven stops in total: three in the city of Carpintería, two along Milpas Street, one on Gutiérrez Street and ending at SBCC Courtesy of Santa Barbara MTD Line 19x, aimed at SBCC students, is scheduled for. begin service coinciding with the start of SBCC's fall semester on August 28. The line will operate year-round, except during SBCC spring and winter breaks, and will offer two northbound trips in the morning, one round trip at noon and two southbound trips in the afternoon. Santa Barbara MTD previously had two bus routes serving the section between Carpinteria and Santa Barbara with lines 20 and 21x. The Line 21x express route was discontinued due to slowness and inoperability, and its stops were incorporated into the route of Line 20. The creation of the micro transit service reflects an effort to provide flexible curb-to-curb transit service to I.V. and the city of Goleta. The micro transit service will begin as a one-year pilot program, according to Blackerby. Santa Barbara MTD temporarily secured state funding from the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, a program administered by the California Department of Transportation. The service map shows two large shaded areas representing “micro-transit zones” in Goleta where the service will operate, as well as two additional specific pick-up and drop-off points in Goleta and four in I.V. The system works similarly to a ride-sharing service, where users can select a pick-up and drop-off location, as long as they exist within micro-transit zones or at a specific point. Rides can be ordered through a smartphone app or by direct call to the MTD Transit Center during business hours. According to Blackerby, drivers can pick up other people using the service while completing any trip. Santa Barbara MTD anticipates wait times for a trip of no more than 15 minutes. ""If you are in one of those points or zones and you want to go anywhere in one of those zones, for example, you would open the phone app and say: ""Me""™. m in the IV Community Center. I want to go to Trader Joes""™"", Blackerby explained, ""It will say, 'Your ride will be there in eight minutes'."" Meanwhile, the driver receives detailed instructions received from the algorithm"". The first micro-traffic zone is the region bounded by Cathedral Oaks Street in the north and Real Street in the south, which extends from N Calle Los Carneros to N Patterson Avenue Street. The second zone is south of the highway, bounded by Storke Street, Hollister Avenue and Highway 1, and encompasses newer housing projects such as Willow Springs Apartments and Goleta City Hall. Goleta train station, the Santa Barbara Airport, UCSB Elings Hall, UCSB Bus Loop, the El Colegio exit bus stop and Embarcadero del Mar and the I.V. Blackerby Community Center explained that Camino Real Marketplace and the Target shopping center were not included. included in the micro transit service due to the possibility that high traffic in those areas would reduce the speed of the service. ""A couple of questions we have had are: 'Why don't you go all the way around Isla Vista?'"", Others. People have also said, ""Why don't you just go to Camino Real Marketplace?"" Blackerby said. ""So why don't we want to go through the intersection of Storke and Hollister? Have you been there? If our truck had to deal with that, it would never get out."" The new service will operate from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. m. at 9 p.m. m. Tuesday to Sunday, operating a fleet of all-electric Ford Transit vans. ""We had to pick the six most important days for something like this, and we thought Sunday would be a pretty important day to buy merchandise,"" Blackerby said. The regular one-way fare will be priced at $3 per trip, with a discounted fare of $1.50 for seniors 62 and older and for people with disabilities. There will also be an option available for anyone to take a free transfer on a fixed bus route within an hour of boarding. The vans will have cash boxes and contactless payment methods on board."

Latinx College Day is an annual conference originally conceptualized as an opportunity to primarily reach Latinx middle and high school students, a demographic historically neglected for general college outreach, according to Erik Magana, conference leader for the Day. of Latino University Students and a fourth-year student majoring in Spanish. ""UCSB continues to be a predominantly white institution, but when this conference was held, the Latinx population was less than what is found today so the reach from the university was not there."" was happening,"" Magana said. The conference took place in person this year for the second time since the COVID-19 pandemic. The UCSB Congress is a student-led cultural, social and activist organization that works to provide an inclusive space for students of marginalized identities. There were 24 members of El Congreso who volunteered for the event. The conference hosted students from Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties, who were provided with bus transportation funded by Congress and sponsors. This year's theme was ""The World Is Yours"", which resonated throughout the conference events. “We really wanted to get back to this mindset of not only resistance and resilience, but also self-care, community,” said Magana. ""Even in an exclusionary world, students have space as people to enact change, to be themselves, to grow as individuals, to find their balance."" The keynote speaker was assistant professor for the department of Chicanx studies, Micaela Diaz ""“ Sánchez , who spoke about his personal experiences and “taking the world in his hands,” Magana said. “He did a good job of presenting his personal narrative to the audience and his message about how we should not give up and make sure we are striving and achieving. our goals that we have in the present, the future and beyond,"", freshman in Chicana and Chicano studies and member of El Congreso Axel Valencia Alvarez said. After the keynote address, the associate director of the Admissions Office of School Services, Cuca Acosta, gave a presentation on UCSB admissions and financial aid, and attendees could choose from 18 workshops, including an activist tour of El Congreso, leadership as an immigrant, history of Palestinian and Latin American solidarity, lessons in Mitotiliztli ""”a traditional Aztec dance""” and a support space for LGBTQIA+ students. Valencia ílvarez highlighted the activist tour as one of her favorite workshops of the day and said it provided middle and high school attendees with an understanding of student activism at UCSB and the historic work of El Congreso as an organization. ""It gave students an opportunity to understand student activism and why students are the leaders of the campus,"" he said. Congress members hold conference t-shirts displaying this year's theme, ""The World Is Yours."" Courtesy of í“scar Moncada A space for LGBTQIA+ students was hosted at the conference for the first time in two years, created from a collaboration between El Congreso and the Resource Center for Gender and Sexuality Diversity (RCSGD) ""“ the center for resources and LGBTQIA+ support. Fourth-year environmental studies major Richie Montes Lemus said the workshop intentionally had an informal atmosphere to create a welcoming space for LGBTQIA+ middle and high school students. “We started with some tea to calm their minds. nerves and created a safe space where they felt comfortable enough to ask the questions they really wanted to ask,"" he said. ""We also realized that they've probably seen a lot of structured presentations throughout the day, so we wanted to give them a rest."" Topics ranged from the exploration of sexualities to queer relationships and self-care. Montes Lemus said the workshop was responsible for creating a safe space for authenticity and comfort which is the great mission of RCSGD. ""We want to have a campus and university where all groups are heard and represented and we have to have these workshops at the forefront so that they feel comfortable enough knowing that they have a place for themselves on campus,"" they said. The presentations and workshops were followed by an inspiring presenter, California State University, Fullerton assistant professor of sociology Edwin Lopez, who spoke about resilience in an exclusionary world. Congress invited The So-Lows ""“ a modern soul music band from Oxnard, California ""“ back to the conference for the second time in a row. Magana emphasized the importance of providing live entertainment during Latin College Day, saying that many of the participants do not easily have that luxury. ""Most students aren't exposed to live entertainment because it costs a lot of money to go out to see bands or because they're too young,"" he said. ""We really just want to bring local entertainment, local groups, to expose them to good music and have a good time."" Magana spoke about her personal connection to Latinx College Day, saying that attending the conference in high school gave her inspiration for the student activism and joining El Congreso. ""I have been attending this conference since my sophomore year in high school and I felt how empowering it was to have that support from the student organizers at school,"" she said. ""Coming to UCSB, attending this conference was one of the reasons why I wanted to be a part of El Congreso as an organization and why organizing this conference was important to me."" Magana said the conference is a significant part of the primary mission of El Congreso which is community advocacy for marginalized groups inside and outside of UCSB. ""We know that this institution is exclusive and we know that the university does not provide a platform for our organization to organize in a way that is truly supported, so we build the spaces ourselves,"" he said. This conference is an example of why those needs must be met, otherwise the 300 children who were sitting in this room will not have the resources we are asking for,"" Magana continued. ""Not only is it our community on campus,"" “it is our communities, neighborhoods, and the students who may end up attending UCSB."" Magana expressed pride and gratitude for the success of Latino College Day, saying that this year set a precedent for more conferences like this in the coming years. ""As I will soon graduate, I am so proud of the work that has been accomplished to resurrect this conference,"" he said. ""This conference is crucial to the continuation of El Congreso and the growth of the students we work with."""

CSTA further alleged that Core Spaces sent a retaliatory cease-and-desist letter to a member of the Santa Barbara Tenants Union after a member ""[told] the truth about [Core Spaces'] actions toward its partner charities such as the Tony and Chriscross Foundations."" Darnaby said the demand letter was sent to an individual who repeatedly harassed ""an employee, his or her spouse, and the nonprofit organizations in which this employee was involved unrelated to Core Spaces."" inappropriately shared employees' personal contact information to the public, including information about their spouses and children, encouraging further action to be taken against this individual,"" Darnarby said. ""We found this behavior to be inappropriate and were concerned it would incite violence. against the employee or his family."" CSTA described the evictions in the letter as an act of gluttony and lamented the strains that families and students have to face as a result of displacement. ""We believe your fundamental value is profit maximization at the expense of current communities that hinder your path,"" the letter continued ""Many of us are students who will have to leave university because of this; many are essential workers who work in hospitals, workshops mechanics, landscaping, restaurants and we will have to leave our jobs. If you believe in a community and value people, stop this mass eviction."""
la-vista,"La Comisión Trans y Queer inicia UCSB Pride 2023 con Queer Fest, ayuntamiento Tran","The Trans and Queer Commission kicks off UCSB Pride 2023 with Queer Fest, Tran town hall","The Associated Students Trans and Queer Commission held a Queer and Trans Town Hall with a Queer Festival on Monday, April 10 to kick off its 9th Annual UC Santa Barbara Pride Week. One of the 13 student vendors talks to passersby at Little Acorn Park's Queer Fest. Maddy Fangio / El Nexo Diario Queer Fest, located in Little Acorn Park with approximately 200 attendees, featured live music from local artists like Redd, arts stations for building charms and bracelets, and 13 commercial vendors selling stickers, stationery and more articles by LGBTQIA+ students. The Isla Vista Recreation and Park District (IVRPD) and the Santa Barbara Arts Fund collaborated to make the public event free. “We wanted a means for LGBTQIA+ student vendors to have a place to sell their materials, get support, be seen, related and connected to people,” co-chair of the Trans & Queer Commission (TQC) and double major in sociology and fourth-year English, Anusikha Halder said. ""Also [the festival] was a space and an event where people could really enjoy themselves, relax, de-stress and have a good time with the community,"" Halder continued. Isabella Ramirez, a third-year environmental studies student and TQC Pride commissioner, was proud that Queer Fest kicked off UCSB Pride 2023, a weeklong event featuring a fashion dance workshop, an LGBTQIA+-focused clothing swap , Queer Prom and a free drag show. ""We wanted this to be open to the public so people can enjoy it and we really want it to be a relaxed event to kick off our Pride Week,"" Ramirez said. During the event, IVRPD unveiled a permanently installed mural celebrating Pride and the LGBTQIA+ community, something IVRPD Recreation Coordinator Sophia Lake said was an exciting element of Queer Fest. ""One of our main goals is to increase art in our parks because public art is such an incredible thing that really brings communities together,"" Lake said. “We wanted to commemorate both Pride Week and the LGBTQIA+ community within Isla Vista through the mural.” Muralist, Dez Porter, said the concept of the artwork was the theme of UCSB Pride 2023: “The future is queer"", expressing his excitement at having the mural permanently installed in Little Acorn Park. Attendee looks for stickers at the Trans and Queer Commission booth at Queer Fest. Maddy Fangio / Daily Nexus ""I want [people] to be proud and excited that something like this is happening,"" Porter said. ""I was actually born and raised in Santa Barbara, so it's exciting to know that something like this is here."" The mural depicts two androgynous characters holding hands while looking up at the sky, illustrating feelings of hope and optimism, he said Porter. The characters also wear floral dresses, inspired by Marsha P. Johnson, a prominent activist in the gay rights movement of the 1960s, and the flower crowns she wore during the Stonewall Riots of 1969. ""They're supposed to that it should be hopeful and look towards the promise of the future, super optimistic"" they said. Lake said it's especially pressing to celebrate Queer joy amid the country's current political climate. More than 100 anti-LGBTQIA+ bills have been introduced in 22 states this year through January 2023, according to NBC News. ""Especially with the anti-trans, anti-LGBT legislation happening around the country right now, we wanted to show our support and show that the community loves them and accepts them and that we are a stronger community together,"" he said. Porter echoed Lake's sentiment, speaking of the importance of having a unified front as a community against discriminatory legislation. Local artist Redd performs covers and original songs for the crowd at Queer Fest. Maddy Fangio / El Nexo Diario ""When these types of issues are brought to the forefront in the mainstream media, the mainstream media takes control and has a larger voice than ours, which can be discouraging,"" Porter said. ""So I think [events] like this are really important to bring us together and have a unified voice."" A quarterly town hall hosted by TQC before Queer Fest was intended to create a space for the commission to hear feedback and get the community LGBTQIA+ at UCSB felt “safe and seen,” according to third-year sociology and political science double major and TQC co-president Angellina Querol. The town hall, which was held in the Multicultural Center ballroom, began with Halder encouraging attendees about her favorite television series with LGBTQIA+ representation and offering reassurance that the event was a safe space. “TQC holds a town hall every quarter to emphasize the fact that we are here for you,” Halder said. ""You have a voice, you have advocacy and we are advocating on your behalf. So this is your time and place to solve problems."" Halder spoke about the history and work of TQC and highlighted the third-year writing and literature major and Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (RCSGD) Outreach Coordinator Mikayla Buhbe to share the work of RCSGD. Buhbe highlighted RCSGD's classroom space with physical resources such as food, free printing, free menstrual supplies, safe sex supplies and more, as well as confidential counseling. She then spoke about the center's scheduling of several social and educational events, highlighting upcoming events for Trans Visibility Week. “Our goal is to serve as broad a community as we can,” Buhbe said during the town hall. Discussing how to offer support to LGBTQIA+ people in the face of bullying at school, Halder presented a possible inclusive safety seminar for students of color without police involvement and as healing spaces for different marginalized communities. ""Often, [community healing sessions] serve as memorials or are a response to a tragedy, which is really important, but I think it's also important to recognize the stress that our students in our communities continually put themselves under."", Halder said during the town meeting. Town hall participants weighed in with their own suggestions, including organizing self-defense classes for members of the transgender community. Buhbe mentioned possible listening sessions at the RCSGD to discuss how to center social justice on campus. \""The idea behind those [sessions] are ""‹""‹spaces for group discussion and meetings about what the campus would look like if it were built around social justice work,"" Buhbe said during the town hall. ""So we have an anonymous feedback survey that's on our social media to get an idea of ​​what we're looking for and I think student safety can absolutely be mentioned."" Halder then asked the group what would make LGBTQIA+ spaces at UCSB feel more accessible and welcoming, and the group discussed the installation and evolution of gender-neutral bathrooms on campus. “The [gender-neutral] bathrooms in the new building have been the best bathrooms on campus, so thank you for advocating for them,” said one attendee, referring to the gender-neutral bathrooms in the Interactive Learning Pavilion. Another attendee asked for an accessible resource guide outlining the different medical and healthcare options available to transgender students on campus. Halder said the town hall helps the commission be a more accessible resource for LGBTQIA+ students. ""Going forward, the commission will really move forward with making resource guides and reaching out to people and having more community healing spaces, so people feel connected to something that has existed, they just didn't know about it,"" they said."

la-vista,"Los empleados del comedor de UCSB hacen campaña para sindicalizarse en medio de malas condiciones, bajos salarios, y acoso","UCSB dining hall employees campaign to unionize amid poor conditions, low pay, and harassment","UC Santa Barbara's Student Dining Labor union publicly launched its campaign today to unionize students employed in the four campus dining commons, demanding better wages, working conditions and treatment. UCSB Residential Dining operates four dining halls: Carrillo, De La Guerra, Ortega and Portola, which serve more than two million meals annually and employ fewer than 500 part-time students. The Nexo spoke to five organizers from the Student Dining Hall Union (SDLU), including Sociology and History of Public Policy sophomore and lead organizer Cole McCarthy and Math and Financial Statistics and Data Science sophomore Christopher Pang. . The other students spoke on condition of anonymity. The push for unionization began quietly in April 2022 with the gathering of a small cohort of workers employed at Ortega Dining Commons. McCarthy said the effort “developed rapid support” and spread to the other three dining halls. McCarthy said organizers used the past year to gauge community interest, receive support and legal advice from local union chapters and establish an action plan to apply for unionization. According to him, nearly 100 student cafeteria staff members have been involved in private union discussions over the past year. SDLU seeks “fair wages, adequate working conditions, protection from harassment and more through unionization,” the group wrote in a May 18 Instagram post @sdlu_ucsb. The UC Santa Barbara Student Dining Labor Union publicly launched its campaign today to unionize students employed in the four campus dining commons, demanding better wages, working conditions and treatment. “We work every day to provide meals to students and keep the university running smoothly, and as a result we deserve fair treatment,” SDLU said in a statement to Nexus. Each student emphasized low pay and limited potential for raises, despite performing physically demanding work, as a primary concern. Hourly wages start at $15.75 and are capped at $16 unless students hold a manager position, according to employees. “There are a lot of jobs on campus that start at a higher level and aren't as physically demanding,” said one Carrillo employee. ""Something many of us struggle with is how much the work demands on us throughout shifts and the lack of accommodations we tend to get for it."" The wage issue extends to difficulties with scheduling and lack of a differential pay rate for overtime. Pang said he worked dozens of eight-hour-plus shifts and the occasional 12-hour shift, none of which he was provided with a differential overtime pay rate. ""The fact that we're still making 25 cents above the minimum wage is pretty absurd, especially relative to their total workforce, it's not much. It wouldn't take that much to give us a living wage,"" McCarthy said. An Ortega employee further explained that students were expected to fulfill a higher volume of takeout orders, and management increased the number from seven orders every two minutes to 20 orders, with no additional benefits or compensation. ""We spend more time constantly working trying to fulfill orders. There is not a moment to rest,"" they said. ""In all this time we have not received any type of increase for this greater amount of work that we are doing, which also means that the university is making more money from the dining halls because they are filling more orders, but our salary remains the same. "" Students cited personal and co-worker complaints of foot, back, and wrist pain and repetitive stress injuries due to the constant physical movements of running, lifting, and bending to complete tasks. The Carrillo employee said managers have a ""lack of regard for the well-being"" of their employees, working to exhaustion. ""There was a time last week when I was doing the work of four people because not many people came to work,"" he said. ""I feel like I wasn't even given accommodations; I couldn't finish my break."" SDLU seeks to demand improvements in hourly wages, overtime pay, work breaks, sick leave benefits and scheduling, according to the notes of the internal meeting dated March 5. Dining hall employees are fully responsible for finding coverage for their shifts in case of illness or need for personal time off, a point of stress for many workers. ""Students have the entire responsibility to find someone to cover you,"" Pang said. ""It doesn't matter if you're sick. Even if someone has COVID, they'll ask you to find someone to cover for you."" During the pandemic, managers expected dining room employees to find a person to cover their shift if they tested positive and needed isolate or quarantine, according to the students. McCarthy added that managers sometimes ""encouraged them to come anyway"" if they were sick. Another key demand for SDLU relates to improvements to poor working conditions. The problem arises from the UC Regents' legal designation as a ""public trust,"" which exempts it from labor statutes that regulate the salaries and benefits of California public employees. Order No. 4 of the state regulation governing minimum wages, overtime pay, rest periods, sick leave, workplace temperatures, and other worker benefits and protections does not apply to the Regents of the UC. The California Court of Appeals upheld this exemption in its 2021 ruling Gomez v. Regents of the University of California. Inadequate ventilation and temperature control affects the four dining commons, and dehydration and fainting due to extreme heat is a recurring experience among workers, according to employees. ""Most of the time, you don't have air conditioning. They're going to have the heater on, on days when it's already hot while you're working in the kitchen, which is hot,"" said the Ortega employee. ""There are people who have fainted during work, especially when you're working in the laundry room because it's so hot in there."" They said Ortega's boiler didn't work for about six months, and the students were ""absolutely freezing"" while they worked during the winter quarter. “There is simply absolutely no regulation of the environment in which it is bearable to work,” “‹”‹they said. Pang said temperature control has been broken for a year and a half at Ortega, and the room where hot takeout meals are packed lacks proper ventilation. ""It's very hot back there because there's almost no ventilation,"" Pang said. ""Recently, they finally installed a small fan in the top corner which helps a little bit, but it does very little in terms of getting the hot air out, so people are sweating. They're trying to try to survive without melting."" Due Due to the UC Regents' exemption from Order No. 4, cafeteria workers also ""do not have the right to sit at any time during work,"" said the Ortega employee. ""As soon as a manager comes, everyone stands up because if they see you doing that, you'll get in trouble,"" they said. Order No. 4 states that ""all working employees shall be provided with adequate seating when the nature of the work reasonably permits the use of seating"", and that when the nature of the work requires the employee to stand, the seating must be provided. placed near the work area for employee use, ""when it does not interfere with the performance of their duties."" McCarthy said the issue became ""controversial"" among workers and managers after many cases in which students were denied a seat at or near their workstation. ""I think it lends itself to the way our managers tend to see us as tools to get things done rather than people with needs,"" they said. Pang said there are rampant health problems in all dining halls, from lax hand-washing policies and dirty surfaces to unsanitary food handling and preparation. ""The health inspectors went to all the dining rooms, and then we, from what I understand, just failed in Ortega and we had a week to desperately clean the area,"" Pang said. Students also said inappropriate behavior and harassment is a known and prevalent problem that the university has not addressed. ""We may experience harassment from management,"" McCarthy said. ""Most of our relationships with the full-time chefs there are pretty good, but many of us have experienced sexual harassment from the chefs."" Pang said that instead of the university actively addressing the problem by firing the perpetrators of sexual harassment, he was ordered as a student manager to reassign employees who presented as women from certain positions, such as cleaning staff. ""I've been implicitly asked to only send people who present as men to work in that position. 'Just don't send people who present as women,'"" Pang said. McCarthy expressed frustration at the university's inaction. "" They often make people who present as men feel directed toward those positions because it's usually not a fun position, but it also speaks to the question of, why can't they just stop the harassment? Why can't they deal with bullying? They know it exists. They've talked about it, they know it exists,"" he said. McCarthy noted that students who work in residential dining predominantly come from low-income backgrounds and shoulder the burden of paying for college expenses and the high cost of housing on campus and in Isla Vista “A lot of the people who work there are not well-off in any way,” McCarthy said. “A lot of these people are forced to work alongside their studies to pay for tuition, housing, etc., and I think. ""It would be a testament to the university's commitment to taking care of those people if they treated them fairly and made up for what they have to lose by having to do this work in the first place."" The Ortega employee said they work about 16 hours a week to pay the high costs of rent in I.V. and other basic expenses. They depend on EBT to buy groceries and previously lived on food from the cafeteria and resources from the Associated Students Food Bank. ""I know I'm definitely not the only one in this situation,"" they said. ""Many of us are working, trying to survive and keep up with the cost of living, and that is negatively affecting our school performance and our prospects after school."" SDLU is planning its first rally for May 24 at 1 p.m. by the Arbor to generate publicity about poor working conditions in soup kitchens and launch their campaign for unionization. “We hope to inspire autonomy and democratic values ​​both in our workplace and others across campus through our efforts,” SDLU said in a statement to Nexo. ""Fight alongside us as we push to make conditions on campus more livable."" McCarthy said the campaign will serve as a ""litmus test"" for public support and he hopes to appear as a union before the Union Relations Board. California Public Employment within the next school year. He added that SDLU anticipates the university's setback. ""They will almost certainly challenge our unionization effort every time we show up,"" McCarthy said. ""They will likely refuse to recognize our efforts for an extended period of time, in which case we are ready to engage in whatever legal battle we need to recognize ourselves, both legally and on the ground."""

Especially to our first-generation Spanish-speaking graduates who are breaking cycles and paving the way for others. Thank you for not only being an inspiration for the little ones of the next generations, but also for those who are currently working to one day have their degree like you. Right or wrong, this has been the place where, as cheesy as it sounds, you learned things about yourself, where you had to live without being under the watchful eye of your parents, but you still endured everything and demonstrated your strength and will. From dealing with strict teachers to putting up with your dorm neighbors who kept being the loudest at three in the morning and in the middle of Tuesday to finish it. Just like Taylor Swift said, ""Make friendship bracelets, take the moment and savor it. You don't have to be afraid."" Walk on your favorite beach (though make sure you have tar remover on hand), sing and dance with your friends. favorite people, enjoy the chimes of Storke Tower and the craziness you experienced in DP (what happens in DP stays in DP) and walk on that podium representing your roots with great pride.

Do not leave with a heavy heart, but with the excitement of knowing that you are about to begin the next stage of your life. We are proud of you, wear your cap and gown with pride, because each of you deserves to enjoy the culmination of this great achievement. They are cool, congratulations!"
la-vista,Ponte las pilas,Get your batteries,"If we're honest, I didn't learn about mental health and its importance until I got to college. I spent most of my life hearing how hard-working we Latinos are, of the Latin rigor ""“ of breaking the stereotypes that shadow us. In my family and possibly yours too, pride is outstanding and the mentality ""yes we can!"" surrounds us at every moment. In case, I was always short-sighted ""“ in my mind I had no choice but to stand out and fight for my goals. I didn't pay much attention to my mental health or the effect it had on my well-being and I really didn't see the point. The only thing that mattered to me was getting away from the negative expectations for being Latina. More than half of Hispanic youth between 18 and 25 years of age with serious mental illnesses do not have access to treatment. Only 35.1% of Hispanic adults with mental illness receive treatment each year compared to the U.S. average of 46.2%. There are many reasons why these statistics appear that way. First, there may be a language barrier, as the average mental health resource appears only in English. Even more difficult is being able to communicate what you are experiencing with someone who can understand you. Although 40% of Californians identify as Hispanic or Latinx, only 9% of clinical psychologists, 21% of marriage and family therapists, and 27% of mental health specialists identify as Latinx. There are many linguistic differences in the way we express our experiences. The term ""nerves"" is used loosely and many times and knowing and understanding what is really happening is what stands between a proper diagnosis. Being able to receive help from someone who truly understands you is essential to being able to improve yourself. Courtesy of Creative Commons Another struggle that limits access to mental health support or treatment is cost. 17.0% of Hispanics/Latinxs in the U.S. live in poverty (compared to 8.2% of non-Hispanic whites) and individuals who live in poverty have a higher risk of mental illness. It is a vicious cycle and difficult to overcome since those who suffer from mental illness also suffer from poverty. Many Latinos do not have access to adequate health insurance which makes it even more difficult to seek help. In addition to facing an already limited pool of providers due to language barriers, people who identify as Hispanic/Latino have even fewer options when they are uninsured. When faced with the options of using their money to pay rent or to talk to someone about a mental health problem, the question answers itself. To make matters worse, our culture worsens opportunities to receive help. Sayings like, “dirty clothes are washed at home” or “get your act together” only add salt to the wound. The stigma behind mental health inhibits the opportunity to access services to improve quality of life. Asking for help is very difficult, especially when doing so will label you ""crazy"". Our culture widely believes that mental illness does not exist, that it is just a lack of desire. This stigma also carries over to receiving medications. Countless times I have heard, ""Why are you taking that, you don't occupy it, you just want to do it"", but the problem is not and never was a lack of desire, but rather incessant life events that hit relentlessly again and again. Not everything is solved with encouragement and it does not need to be done alone. Sometimes you take on too much and it's not something you should be ashamed of. Many times I have thought that to be successful, you have to suffer but it doesn't have to be that way. Latinos keep in mind that to avoid being a stereotype, you have to dedicate your entire life to exceeding expectations. We don't have to prove anything to anyone. We don't have to say or brag about how much we suffer without help. We deserve a break. We deserve to take care of ourselves. Yes, it is possible and it has always been possible."

I, along with many travel guides and restaurant reviewers, believed that the Lazy Susan was an ancient, ""authentic"" part of Chinese cuisine, literally a centerpiece of Chinese food. However, its modern use actually dates back to 1953, when Chinese Americans named Johnny Kan and Dr. Theodore Lee (that's my last name, a very common one) implemented it in a Cantonese-style restaurant. Kaylee Heartman / Daily Nexus While I'm still not sure how much water there is in this story, it begs the question: how much of Chinese American history has been falsely attributed to market as ""authentic""? As it turns out, a lot. Placing authentic cuisine on a pedestal often erases a rich history of immigrant families and erases the achievements that past immigrants surpassed in the face of racism. This contributes to a false dichotomy between one's ethnic history and life in America, which continues a perception that ethnic Americans are perpetual foreigners and reinforces the idea of ​​a ""white America."" In 1849, Chinese Americans began immigrating to California during the gold rush where many Chinese immigrants founded restaurants that sold inexpensive, high-quality food to gold miners. They used easily available local ingredients and worked to satisfy the tastes of other Americans (the most popular dish in the 1910s, ""chop suey,"" directly translates to leftovers. This influx of migrants resulted in an increase in racist rhetoric, painting Chinese migrants as if they were part of the ""yellow peril."" The most popular caricature representing the culmination of fear of Chinese migrants was Dr. Fu-Manchi, the villain in the Sax crime novel series. Rohmer was depicted with exaggerated yellow skin, slanted eyes, and wearing traditional Chinese clothing. He was characterized as a cold and calculating ""devil doctor."" He continued to make appearances in film and in media, seen as a painted white man. yellowface, well into the 1940s. In 1882, anti-Chinese sentiment reached an extreme with the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese workers from entering the United States. This was the first law restricting immigration to the United States, and it was renewed again in 1892 by the Geary Act. However, there are many crucial exceptions to these acts, one of them being business visas. After all, if there's one thing the U.S. government loves more than hating ethnic minorities, it's capitalism. Business visas allowed many Chinese to enter the United States, creating a viable loophole for immigrants to circumvent the Chinese Exclusion Act. As a result, many Chinese immigrants opened restaurants upon arrival. Chinese food literally served as a ticket to the United States and for many was an opportunity for a new life. Even so, life for Chinese immigrants continued uphill. As an extension of the ""yellow peril"" fear, many restaurant owners struggled to obtain loans from racist banks, forcing them to operate at extremely low costs and work overtime. Despite these struggles, restaurant owners innovated new types of foods, creating new niches in the culinary sphere that altered traditional Chinese flavors into something more palatable to white consumers. Dishes such as chop suey, broccoli and beef, chow mein, chow fun, egg rolls, and some variations of kung pao chicken gained popularity. Dishes became sweeter, boneless and more fried. Think Panda Express. By marketing these Americanized dishes as “exotic”, while remaining palatable to the American public, Chinese food in general gained popularity in the West, improving the general disposition towards the Chinese in general. In fact, that popularization of Chinese cuisine played an important role in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1943, which officially repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. This food phenomenon contributes to political activism, it is known as culinary diplomacy. Official culinary diplomacy programs have been created in countries such as Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea and Israel. As the saying goes, the fastest place to the heart is through the stomach. So, despite all the good it has done for Chinese immigrants, why do so many people misattribute and denounce Chinese-American food? The creation of the binary between East and West is a story as old as time, as the terms ""west"" and ""east"" date back to the 14th century and ""West"" and ""Orient"" continue to prevail today , often materializing in ""China against the United States"". This binary makes it difficult for many to conceive of an “in-between”, a diaspora that is neither all-American nor all-Chinese, with loyalty to both and neither. For many, it's easy to call anything that looks vaguely oriental ""Chinese."" In sociolinguistics, this is known as appropriateness: the similarities between Chinese-American food and Chinese food are reduced to one, and the history that differentiates them takes a backseat. This false dichotomy between China and the United States contributes to the idea that the Chinese are perpetual foreigners, permanently relegated to immigrant status and never truly Americans. While it may seem like overt, entitled racism is a thing of the past, I've been coming back to the country. From racist comments sparked by COVID-19 to the Atlanta shooting, there has been a significant increase in hate crimes in the United States. A bill was drafted in Texas earlier this year that would effectively ban Chinese immigrants from buying a home, raising the question of how much anti-Asian sentiment has declined since the nation's earliest days. Even in California, one of the most liberal states in the United States, anti-Asian sentiment is far from absent. Although demographically UC Santa Barbara is almost 20% Asian, during a trip to downtown Santa Barbara, my friends and I came across comments that said ""go back to your country"". Many of them don't realize that my family members have been in the United States for five generations, longer than many white families. While chop suey may not save us from racism, it's important to remember the major role culinary diplomacy plays in allowing Chinese immigrants to enter the United States in the first place. The next time you go to a dim sum restaurant and spin the Lazy Susan, remember that it (and many of the other things on your table) are not from China, but from Chinese Americans, with a unique culture and idiosyncrasies that you cannot find nowhere else. Where else can I get a horoscope reading at the end of my meal? Your favorite Chinese restaurant may not be ""authentically"" Chinese, and it's great that it isn't. It's authentically Chinese-American, and that's something to celebrate. Elizabeth Lee wants to reconsider our views on ""inauthentic"" cuisine, especially since SF Chinatown has some very good fast food dim sum."
la-vista,La restauración de la historia: como el arte transforma la narrativa,Restoring history: how art transforms narrative,"Christy Yu / Daily Nexus The present is built on the past. It is about blood and mistakes, kindness and connection. Even as we look toward the unwritten narrative of the future, we keep one foot firmly in the people and days that came before us. Spanning that division is art. In both history books and unwritten narrative, art plays a fundamental role in society. It acts as a physical documentation of the past, represents the present and allows the narrative to be recovered, even as it seeks to define how current generations will leave their mark on the future. In a word, transformative. The narrative in New Orleans has already been transformed. The statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee towered over the city for years, conveying a long and bloody history of atrocities. The statue was removed in 2017 and in 2020 a new statue reclaimed the space for New Orleans. Sentinel (Mami Wata), created by artist Simone Leigh, was the first statue to begin construction after the removal of the Lee statue. The statue features a goddess of the African diaspora, Mami Wata, with a symbol of power enveloping her. The statue pays tribute to the disaporiric culture and community of New Orleans and was presented standing until 2021, when the exhibition ends and the opportunity for future works of art to reclaim the space. The statue stands at the base of what is now Egalité Circle formerly Lee Circle. The statue was part of the 2021 Prospect New Orleans triennial, led by Naima J. Keith and Diana Nawi, who collaborated with New Orleans leaders and artists to create a narrative of the city made by and for the people. In a statement to ARTnews, the director discusses that, ""ultimately, Simone felt, and we agreed, that because Robert E. Lee's original placement on the pedestal was about power and domination,"" the statue loomed over the city, symbolizing the tyranny of white supremacy"" “that his work should be as close to the level of the individual as possible. His work is monumental, but by being placed at the base of the sculpture it suggests in a way that represents that he is in dialogue with the people of the city."" It is a statement, and even more so a powerful statue. That is the power that art can hold for society. It can give the city a chance to define how they want to represent themselves. Nawi, one of the project's artistic directors, recently spoke at UC Santa Barbara as a visiting professor as part of the curriculum for Museum Practices, an art history course. In one hour and fifteen minutes he explained the role of art and curators. I'm talking about the same project presented above and how art broke the stone on which history was written to shape a new identity. I speak of art not as something passive and inert, but as a growing and changing entity that has the power to inform the present. Nawi's class redefined the role of curators not as selectors of works of art, but as reciprocal relationships that sought to benefit artists and communities. His belief in art to lift stories from the dust of history and make them the focus of the present was transformative like the work of art I speak of. Their projects aren't the only ones that change who is remembered, either. Kehinde Wiley, the artist responsible for iconic paintings like the Obama portrait, opens a new exhibition at the San Francisco de Young Museum that seeks to transform the narrative of black people around the world, but especially in the United States. His exhibit, Archeology in Silence, documents the senseless deaths of African Americans at the hands of police in a way that links men and women to historical portraits and martyrs. His artwork, masterful as well as powerful, demands the attention and thought of viewers as it depicts fallen men and women cut down by brutality. As Dr. Cadet describes in his article ""Kehinde Wiley's Reclaiming Black Lives,"" ""By placing Black bodies in positions reminiscent of ancient masterpieces, Wiley is liberating Black people. With every brushstroke, he takes back the power that black people ever had."" Wiley's art takes power out of the hands of the system and back into black people. His work is a social commentary, a documentation of the now and the act of resistance all at the same time. He infuses power into each portrait, and claims the narrative with every stroke of his brush. Closer to home, and on a smaller scale, the UCSB Museum of Art, Design and Architecture also exhibited works of art that sought to change perceptions and inform the present. The exhibition, ""On Famous Women, 1400-1700"", seeks to illuminate the women who have always had space and power throughout history, from powerful figures such as the Grand Duchess and co-regent of Tuscany Christina of Lorraine to more common that are registered with only a line or two of identification. The display was majestic, grand, and most importantly, transformative. Whatever the artists' intentions when the artworks were first conceived, the modern incarnation of these portraits presented women as beings of power and agency. The exhibition brought historical women into the modern era and gave them the same identity and presence that modern women have. He took the past and used it for the present. Despite the power and good that art does in society, the question of its permanence and the extent of social change that art can bring about is often questioned. Isn't it too little too late? A band-aid on a mortal wound? And while it is true that overhauling a broken system is perhaps beyond the scope of what art can achieve alone, there is more to art than meets the eye. Art, when it enters a museum, remains there in perpetuity. Its care and guardianship is given to the museum, and as long as that museum exists, with few exceptions, that work of art will be preserved forever. Generations long after us will be able to see the artwork, and even after museums and the modern world turn to dust, there are a multitude of ancient works of art that have survived their civilizations to exist thousands of years into the future. . The work of art made today, beyond providing an emotional outlet and expression of human creativity, is a time capsule that is perpetually unearthed and reburied as it seeks to preserve what humanity sought to record. A transformative act, art has the power to redefine the past even as it represents and informs the present. It can act as a vessel for social justice or introspection, and has personal and historical significance that leaves a lasting impact that rewrites the narrative. Reclaim power, redefine who is remembered, and push the limits of understanding the past and present. Art has the ability to represent the different prisms of humanity, in all its fantastic mistakes and triumphs. Haley Joseph takes inspiration from curator Diana Nawi's guest lecture on how art informs the present."
la-vista,Comidas faciles de hacer desde tu dormitorio que te recuerden a casa,Easy meals to make from your bedroom that remind you of home,"I must warn you, living in the dorms is a task for the strong-hearted, especially getting used to your mother's warm and delicious food or access to a fully equipped kitchen to cook any dish. And although the four common dining rooms: De La Guerra (DLG), Ortega, Carrillo and Portola try to include different Hispanic dishes during the week, there will be times where you crave a meal that will take you back home. Living in a dorm where communal kitchens and small refrigerators may limit your ability to make a recipe will be something you'll have to get used to (if you like getting your hands dirty in the kitchen). But don't worry, here I have compiled a list of foods that are possible to make and that one day got me out of trouble when I lived in the dorms. There is nothing better to remind us of our home than a classic ham cake inspired by the television show, El Chavo del Ocho. The fundamental piece of a cake is the bolillo, or birote, as you know it. This can be found at the IV Market in Isla Vista or at Santa Cruz Market or also at Chapala Market in Goleta. The ingredients to complete your delicious cake depend on your tastes and what touch you want to give it. Mayonnaise, avocado, tomato, ham, cheese, pickled chilies, lettuce and any ingredient you have available to make your ideal cake. A basic sandwich, but perfect to bring in your backpack for a busy day, could not compare to how majestic a cake prepared to your liking is. If you need something a little faster and without so much fuss, quesadillas are perfect for a quick breakfast or a midnight craving. You just need tortillas, flour or corn depending on your preference, and some melting cheese. If you want to take your quesadilla to the next level, you can add chopped avocado and ham. Or, if you don't have extra ingredients, you can add a spicy sauce to the cheese. To accompany your delicious dishes, you can make a pitcher of lemon water. You only need water, the squeezed juice of lemons, sugar and ice to taste. You stir it in a jug or in your glass from day to day and that's it. I know that the midnight craving is never missing. You're studying or relaxing in your triple bedroom when a craving hits. Having tortilla chips in your pantry will be a lifesaver. If your mom is like mine, I would say that you always have to have beans in your refrigerator, and while you may technically have a mini refrigerator in your room, it will be a struggle to make the 3 cups of beans that your mom makes at home. So I recommend you cheat and get bagged beans (yes I know, I would give my grandparents some if they knew I had bagged beans in my cupboard, but it was a life or death situation so it's best to say sorry that ask permission), and warm them up. Then you put cheese or some sauce on top and you will have some quick and homemade bean chips. Another way you can use tortilla chips can be by making chilaquiles. They won't be the most precise ones your mom makes, but at least they take away your desire and craving for them. You are going to heat tomato sauce in a container, you can season it to taste with salt, pepper, or garlic powder. Since you are going to pour it over the tortilla chips, while it is hot you can put cheese, chopped cilantro and small pieces of onion on top. And if you feel inspired you can fry an egg and put it on top of your tortilla chips with salsa. Before finishing with these delicious tips, I would like to share a little of the wisdom that I have learned during these last years that helped me survive regarding food: Finally, I want to welcome you to our school. These next few years, you will live the best experiences of your life and you will learn a lot about yourself, enjoy every moment that you never know is coming in the future. Welcome and enjoy!

la-vista,"Hogar, dulce hogar: Vida en Isla Vista",Home Sweet Home: Life in Isla Vista,"As the new year looms over you and fills you with great expectations, you will realize that it may not be exactly what you thought. UC Santa Barbara: the ideal place with perfect weather, far from home and quite different. It's easy to feel displaced, when you're suddenly in a place where the people around you didn't start from the same place. One of the first things you'll realize is that we all have different experiences on this campus. You will attend classes and learn about the demands of a collegiate course and schedule. For some it comes easy, but not for all. There will be students who he worked only to go to school. They will have more time to study and go to office hours. For others, that luxury does not exist. Some pay the tuition themselves and have to work one or two jobs to survive. It doesn't leave much energy or free time for extra tasks. This disproportionate struggle comes to light the more you are surrounded by people who seem to have it figured out, or at least easier. MARI VILLALPANDO-ORTEGA/ EL NEXO DIARIO You will notice that many people like to go out to eat and have fun. The amount of money people spend without thinking twice will make you wonder, How bad am I with money? Do your parents send it to you? Do they have to ask them? You will find the period of time where you adjust to this new environment. Suddenly you are responsible for yourself. You decide what you will do, what you eat, even when you wake up. It's so easy to fall into a frenzy when you first feel a slight freedom. Before arriving in Santa Barbara, I was never allowed to go out after dark. I couldn't go to sleepovers or go out more than once a week. Being able to go out without asking permission is life-giving. I often came home late or started going out late at night. I felt like I was making up for lost time but I also started to feel guilty. I don't remember when it started, but it felt horrible. The guilt made itself known to me. Our previous encounter was when I had to explain why I didn't go to ICU or RCU or any other place closer to home. When I made my decision to go to UCSB, I didn't think much other than ""it's far enough away."" This meant I could visit my parents whenever I wanted, which turned out to be less and less. I thought I would miss my parents more. The phenomenon of converted freedom. in guilt it's crazy. You think you're doing everything right when you get a call from your brother and his voice is different and your sister is starting her first day of school and you're gone. It hurts when you feel like you should never have left. when you have done everything possible to be better, to move forward only to find yourself with this feeling of regret. It is even more difficult when you feel alone. You have come this far with the hand that touched you, but it has. winner appearance. But how you play is up to you. How scary. Therefore, it is important to have community. As a POC, it's often a daunting task. I had culture shock driving to Isla Vista. There were many white people and the number increased along with the time I spent there. There were many white teachers and most of the people of color I found were maintenance and support workers. Almost every street in Isla Vista (IV) is written in Spanish, but almost no one can say it correctly. Then find the community that can do it. To begin with, there are many cultural organizations that are professional or social, the Hermanas Unidas or Los Ingenieros to name a few. Talk to people in your classes and don't hesitate to ask for help or make friends. Find where you feel comfortable. You will learn that your college friends will not look like those in high school. You get together, live and learn in shared spaces and you find more than good friends but also reasons to like your new home. I met a good friend in my Spanish class on Zoom and I met the first person who understood me beyond words in the Santa Ynez apartment laundry room and I have a cat with my sophomore roommate. You find your people in unexpected places. It makes you feel healthy and makes your college experience easier. Don't be like those you see around you. That is, those that allow them the luxury of living in a unique room in I.V. and they don't worry about the next check. There are students who have a private tutor and parents who understand what they are doing. Mine don't know much about what I do. Partly because they don't understand the school system and partly because I'm figuring it out myself. Even if you have difficulties, rest assured that it is possible to make Santa Barbara your home. Often programs like EOP (Education Opportunity Program) or El Congreso host events such as Cinco de Mayo celebrations or dissemination of traditional food with cultural music. Bands and dance teams such as Raíces de Mi Tierra, the UCSB folk group, perform. These moments bring together foreigners who in common have the need for community. Who else will give you a tamale while you go to your next class? Right now you don't have to have friends with everyone, but you still feel the presence of the community. The important thing is that you get out of your comfort zone. Try new things and don't doubt what you are capable of being. Anyway, you are entering a new stage of your life. Independence is something complicated in a Latin family. Especially if you are the first. All of this is new for each of you. They are learning together. Be patient. Over time you will find who you are outside of your parents and your childhood home. It's not exciting?"
la-vista,"Siete consejos para mi ""Freshman Self""","Seven tips for my ""Freshman Self""","Before starting my studies at UC Santa Barbara I was full of hope, but when I faced this new challenge I was filled with fear. From that fear of the unknown when seeing hundreds of young people with their books and notebooks under their arms and many of them speaking in an altruistic language of adult people. I also imagine that they started out just like me, wandering around different classrooms full of dreams far from the family and that ""bubble"" full of care and that everything was for me, starting with having been an only child and not having had an older brother or sister or an emotional guide to have guided me through the different phases and obstacles that come with beginning adulthood. But at the same time I was excited to learn how to flourish in a new environment, full of opportunities and potential to shape my future. This is a list of 7 things I would tell my “freshman self.”. Get involved: Being active in the student community will give you enormous benefits. You can expand your circle of friends and be part of a larger community. UC Santa Barbara has something for everyone, sports clubs, politics, science, art, etc. It's never too late to get involved in an organization. I started writing as a reporter for The Daily Nexus in my senior year. Being part of a team with a mission bigger than myself gave me purpose and helped expose me to the world of journalism. Participate in your classes: As a freshman, you will have to take many introductory classes with at least 100 other students. It's easy to sit in the last seats in the room and get distracted by your cell phone or computer. During my later years, after the pandemic, I challenged myself to sit at the front of the class and be more participatory. At times I may have been a little shy, but by learning to participate and value what was learned in the classes, little by little I began to flow and the dialogues became more and more entertaining between my teachers and classmates. Say yes!: This will be one of the most fun stages of your life. Say yes to almost everything. ""Do you want to go night surfing? Yes!"", ""Do you want to climb Mount Whitney this week before finals? Yes!"" ""Do you want to go backpacking in Big Sur? Yes!"" .
Geographically, California is an incredibly diverse state, take the time to explore it and see all of its layers. Many of my favorite moments were born with him ""Yes!"". Find your niche: We all have talent and purpose in life. Some of us were born with our talent, and others have to find it. Make use of the resources that the University gives you. These resources can help you develop your interests, talents, and passions. The Student Resources and Careers building always has job and apprenticeship opportunities for all different careers and interests. Work part time: If your school calendar allows it, get a job during the school year. When I started working, I learned to structure my time more efficiently and I also learned to value purchasing power more: money. My first job was as a lab assistant in the marine sciences building. Working for the university has many benefits and is very flexible with students' schedules. Live in the moment: Believe me, time passes faster when you get older. Enjoy being a student. One of my favorite memories is traversing all of Isla Vista and campus in the middle of a giant rain storm to get to my oceanography final exam. Although I hated my life at the time, looking back I know it was the first and last time I will have experiences like this in a place like Santa Barbara. It's never too late to start something new: Having an escape from student life is very important for mental health. My escape was learning to surf. I went through a stage where every afternoon I went out to sea with my board to watch the sunset on the water. Learning to surf I met many of my best friends and found a very beautiful community. This helped me balance my time in a very healthy way. Some of my fondest memories have been on the beach or in the ocean in front of UCSB. Remember that your first year is the pre-kindergarten of adulthood. My first year wasn't perfect. I went through many difficult stages and felt alone most of the time. It wasn't until the spring semester that I started to get used to it. Take your time and don't compare your experiences. Everything will make you grow. <3"

I often had free time since my schoolwork was minimal and my free time was too much. Mari Villalpando-Ortega/ El Nexo Diario Tiempo de Vals Chayanne Summer has given me a lot of time to start going to the gym more frequently. Maybe you've heard that re-reading an ex-partner's messages to build motivation before a workout. Well, with that idea in mind, I thought about listening to this ballad before going to the gym, and he reported that it worked. I have to include that this system will probably only work for those girls who didn't have a quinceañera and who harbor a bit of regret about it In My Dreams by Kali Uchis
I have a duty to include Kali Uchis. I play this song loudly while I take a walk along the beaches of West Campus or when I drive on the 101 along the beaches. This upbeat tune makes me feel like I'm swimming through the clouds. The chorus has a hypnotic effect and Uchis' voice never fails. With its soft cadence it brings me good vibes, perfect to celebrate the weather for beach days. Linda de Tokischa and ROSALÄºA 
This song is more than an antem ""“ it's a way of life. Tokischa and Rosalia collaborated this summer to inspire twerking with friends. A mantra that teaches us that fun comes first and foremost. After a tremendous school year, I had it deserved. The perfect touch is the moving and profound message they share with their children Entropy by Daniel Caesar.
After watching Oppenheimer I kept thinking, Where else have I heard this? After three days while taking the bus to El Centro de Santa Bárbara, we passed the roundabout and suddenly I remember: Daniel Caesar. The audio at the beginning of the song Entropy shows the audio of J. Robert Oppenheimer""™s where he says ""Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds."" Call Me (Come Back Home) by Al Green
I love music that makes me want to cook. I pour myself a cup of wine and my favorite socks and start cooking following my mom's semi-memorized recipes. I have had this song on repeat because of its soft melody and because it always makes me want to dance. Ferrari eyes by Karol G, Justin Quiles and Angel Dior
Speaking of dancing. Ojos Ferrari by KAROL G, Justin Quiles and Angel Dior is the perfect song for me. I'm not biased because they say my name like 20 times but it's a cool touch. The rhythm is captivating and in itself inspires the bug inside me. The energetic and vibrant atmosphere coupled with cool rhymes make a perfect song for the summer. Excuse me while I do a little dance. Hummingbird by James Blake and Metro Boomin
Although the talk of Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse has died down, my obsession with the animated film has not. There were so many amazing songs especially the score but the primary song ""Hummingbird"" by Metro Boomin and James Blake, takes first place. This atmospheric song adds a lot of emotional brevity. Right Thurr by Chingy
Another song that will make you jump, Chingy's Right Thurr plays with rhymes with southern accents that forever change the pronunciation of ""there"" and my club bangers playlist. From helping me dissociate at the gym to making people look out the window while I drive, this has been what I've been repeating over the summer."

la-vista,Un debate entre términos: ¿Hispana o Latina?,A debate between terms: Hispanic or Latina?,"As we express ourselves, words contain great value, especially when these words are used to distinguish and categorize groups, communities and identities. Nowadays there are different terms that try to label a rich and varied communities to represent everyone without taking into account that there are different stories, paths and thoughts about oneself. Audrey Kenyon / El Nexo Diario The words Hispanic or Latino are some of the main ones that have been used primarily around us and in everyday life. When you fill out a form at the doctor's office, when you apply to a university, and on many other occasions, you find yourself having to select which ethnicity you best identify with. But how can one word describe years of history and culture? Do we really know what they mean? And will there really be a word that covers us all completely? Hispanics refer to people who have descent from the countries that were colonized by Spain during the conquest and as a result of the colonization adopted Spanish as their primary language. While Latinos refer to people who have a relationship or descent with Latin American and Caribbean countries. When trying to encompass an entire community with different life experiences in these two words, there are no shortage of cases in which these words are not enough. Families who have emigrated from Latin American countries to the United States have a different experience of identity than people who were raised from childhood in the United States, and migrated to their native country as adolescents or adults. My personal relationship with these words and their meaning is often difficult to express. I was born in Sacramento, California to Hidalgo parents, and when I was 5 years old we moved to Hidalgo to reestablish our roots after a deportation. In high school I crossed the border between Tijuana and San Diego every day, and this was where my relationship with my cultural identity began to become cloudy and more complicated. Although my birth certificate says born in the United States and I currently live in Santa Barbara, I remember with affection and longing the connection I felt with my community in Hidalgo. Although I identify as Latina more than Hispanic, it is important to recognize and question the origins of the words that define us. Although they tell us that we are neither from here nor from there and sometimes it feels that way, remember that you do belong and that your identity is worth a lot. Celebrate it. The relationship between identity and culture forms a large part of how our Hispanic or Latino community develops in the United States. It is not only seen in the way traditions change to adapt and survive across the border, but it can also be seen in the language, in the famous ""Spanglish"" that is already part of our daily vocabulary. There are not enough words to describe an entire community with unique experiences, different cultures, traditions that changed according to time and place. However, this month stories of Hispanic experiences are being highlighted in all areas which gives us an opportunity to listen, learn, as well as talk about our own stories. In this month of celebration of Hispanic heritage, I invite you to reflect on the meaning of the words that define you and how they can be used to open a space of empowerment and recognition for our community."
la-vista,La celebración del Mes de la Herencia Hispana en UCSB,Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month at UCSB,"Wake up UCSB! Hispanic Heritage Month has arrived! With the loud roar of our pride and the meat on the grill we celebrate what it is to be Hispanic. What our traditions, dances, food, sayings and deep pride in our culture mean. This recognition began in 1968 as Hispanic Heritage Week by President Lyndon Johnson and was extended to 30 days by President Ronald Reagan. On August 17, 1988, this celebration beginning on September 15 and ending on October 13 was approved by public law 100-402. The reason why it begins on September 15 instead of the first is because on the 15th the independence day of many countries in Latin America is celebrated, including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The next day the independence of Mexico is celebrated and on September 18 Chile celebrates its independence day. Belize celebrates it on September 21. This celebration has brought us together. In this month of union, Latin American countries celebrate their independence, their liberation and patriotic pride. MARI VILLALPANDO-ORTEGA/ EL NEXO DIARIO The Hispanic population has increased in several places in the United States. Mainly, in California and Texas. California reported 15.8 million Hispanics in 2021 and Latinos represented 40% of California's population, one of the highest proportions in the country. In Texas, the state with the next largest Latino population (11.9 million), Latinos also made up 40% of the state's population and surpassed the white population by approximately 230,000 to become the largest racial or ethnic group in Texas. , according to the 2021 US survey. In itself, our population continues to grow but don't think I'm only talking about Mexicans. The fastest population growth among American Latinos occurred among those with origins in Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Guatemala. With this increase in population comes cultural diversity which enriches our lives. We learn more about ourselves and our neighbors. We must strengthen our roots and foster relationships. At UCSB, 23.8% of the population identifies as Latinx or Hispanic and in 2015, UCSB was named the first Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI). Noche De Banda UCSB has many Latinx organizations like the Latinx Business Association (LBA) who hosts events like Noche de Banda. This October 13th they will invite a local band from Santa Barbara called Los Anclas to Isla Vista. Doors open at 9 p.m. and presale tickets are $10 and $15 at the door.

There are many sayings about pride in Spanish, since Spanish speakers are proud. And why not have it? Being Hispanic is beautiful. It is a life-giving culture, full of rich colors and flavors. The collective nature of our being and our passion for what we do. Why not be proud of that? Celebrate loudly with these upcoming events on our campus and with all your heart, happy celebrations!"
la-vista,"Gauchos y vaqueros: Los ""Cowboys"" tienen influencia latinoamericana","Gauchos and cowboys: The ""Cowboys"" have Latin American influence","We all know the stories of Texan cowboys or American cowboys, but we never pay enough attention to the origins of this identity. Being from a Mexican family, I understand cowboy customs and that they begin with contact with the Spanish, resulting in the importation of horses and creation of ranches within Mexico. However, I never knew that there were other Latin Americans who are part of the ranchería. And being a UCSB student you always wonder, what is a gaucho? During my studies in Argentina as an exchange student, I learned a lot about gaucho culture and I relate it a lot to cowboy culture. This topic did not escape my mind and I began to carry out research on other regions and the ranchero style within other Latin American countries. I found that there are llaneros in Colombia and Venezuela and also huasos in Chile. All of these identities were different and everything played a big part in creating the image we know today in the United States as the ""cowboy"". The Gaucho The word gaucho comes from the Quechua and Mapuche word ""huacho"", which means orphan. Gauchos were mestizos and sometimes mulattoes from Uruguay, Argentina and southern Brazil, who were experts in cavalry. They used a knife, a lasso and ""boleadoras"" (three stones linked by a rope to get tangled in the animals' legs) to capture, kill or move cows. The gauchos' clothing consisted of panchos made of wool, wide hats, vests, scarves around their necks, belts with silver buckles and ""bombachas"" (wide pants tight at the ankles). The gaucho identity had a lot to do with freedom, love of the land and, above all, being a man of the countryside. Part of the gauchesca culture is telling stories, singing songs, dancing malambo and playing the guitar. During the 1900s, the privatization of land and ranches began and this created many problems for the gauchos. They were nomads and had the ideology that no one has the right to own the land. The government began to identify gauchos as bandits or vagrants because they did not have permanent jobs and did not own any territory. The government knew that gauchos have very different abilities and took advantage to capture them and forcefully enlist them in the army. Today, the gaucho is a representative figure and is almost mythological. However, there are still many people who identify as gauchos because they have continued the habits, customs or are ancestors of the gauchosca culture. The Vaquero As I mentioned earlier, after the Spanish arrived in Mexico in 1519, ranches were established. In this context, the native people of Mexico learned very quickly how to handle cows and ride horses. There was a separation between the Spanish knights and the cowboys, who were natives. Cowboys developed rope skills and made rawhide braids. From all this began what is known as the cowboy and charrería culture. In the 1800s, as the Mexican and American battle occurred in the years 1846 to 1848, more Anglo-Americans began to move to land that formerly belonged to Mexico, and began to adapt the cowboy style. From this came the ""cowboy"" culture and began to expand within several countries in the United States. Usually the cowboys have on their leather belt, their hat made of hay and their boots. They wear tight-fitting pants with wide ankles, bolero vests, and girdles. Like gauchos they also like to dance, tell stories, sing songs, and play the guitar. In addition to this they have a different sport of charrería where they do events called charreadas to demonstrate and compete in events that demonstrate their cowboy skills. A variant of the charrería includes the escaramuzas which are ladies mounted on horses directing them in coordination with the sound of the music. It is very important to know that the American ""cowboy"" that we have known is a product of Latin American influences. It all started with the introduction of horses to the Americas and now there are several ranch cultures throughout Latin America. So the next time you put on your boots, belt and hat, remember the story behind these pieces. They represent characteristics of Latin Americans who have worked the land for generations."
la-vista,¡No puedes sentarte con nosotros!,You can't sit with us!,"How ironic it is that the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month includes the reason why those Latin American countries have to become independent. Say? Isn't it enough that we have to learn useless conjugations in high school or that some Spanish artists try to appropriate Latin culture? Fortunately our savior has arrived. Mr. Newson gave us a joyful announcement on September 14, 2023. What was it? Name this month Latino Heritage Month. But maybe you're wondering, so what? Well my misinformed friends, it means that we are finally free from Spanish influence. It is the time of Latin Americans. Let the Brazilians who are not Hispanic because their official language is Portuguese, stand up. Those from Belize whose language is English and other countries in Latin America who have been isolated for not being Spanish speakers. The term Hispanic is unfortunately a word which includes Spain because it is a country whose official language is Spanish despite the strange way in which they speak it. Over and over again we have to think about Spain and the Spanish flu they brought. However, now we enter a new era where the madness of celebrating alongside the colonizers is recognized. ""It's something very silly I think, especially because I remember that in my high school we celebrated Latinos during this month even though our mascot was the Conquistadores,"" said fourth-year student Zoila Torpe. MARI VILLALPANDO-ORTEGA/ EL NEXO DIARIO One of the reasons why we celebrate is the independence of Latin American countries. But in what world do we also have to celebrate the country that did the colonization? Thanks to Newman, we don't have to go through that shame of validating Spain. Once again we see how great it is to live in California. Although unfortunate events sometimes happen like the existence of Huntington Beach or the persistence of xenophobia in places with Spanish names, at least the ""vosotros"" is not taken seriously and the heat is favorable (in some places). Let's officially say that you can no longer join us. If you speak to me in Spanish it should be without a lisp, and as Mana said, ""Me Vale"". I'm sorry ROSALíA, but it's time to sit down."
la-vista,"Simple Dicho: ¿Por qué el tiempo ""vuela"" cuando nos divertimos?","Simple Saying: Why does time ""fly"" when we're having fun?","It seems that time is slipping away from us all. Even though historical mechanisms like the calendar and the clock help us organize ourselves in our three-dimensional reality, our internal experiences can be very different. Why is it that time can reach extremely slow speeds but can also fly by, especially when we are having fun? These questions have guided scientists with studies on time perception. KATYA KISELEVA /THE DAILY NEXUS Unlike our senses, there is no organ dedicated to perceiving time. Rather, scientists have identified that several areas of the brain work together to execute and regulate time perception. The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and basal ganglia have been seen to activate with studies on temporal discrimination tasks. While the question of where in the brain is generally accepted, the question of how time perception occurs at a neurological level However, in recent years, many empirical studies that have explored the broader process of time perception have found that it is intrinsically linked to subjective sensations, such as increases in anxiety levels or chronic pain. , facilitate how the body measures time. The underlying theory is that bodily changes draw attention to the fact that the current self feels different than at previous moments. The awareness that a change of state has occurred, caused by. Visceral signals in the insular cortex (a lobe of the cerebral cortex dedicated to multimodal sensory processing and other regulated functions of homeostasis) propagate the understanding that a passage of time has occurred. Memory, then, is crucial for the perception of time, since it marks how different bodily states correspond to moments along the continuous trajectory of time from the past to the present and the future. Like physiological sensations, emotions are linked to the perception of time and have been found to extremely affect the degree of time perception and help with the storage of memories, helping to explain why the sensation of time can vary depending on mood. . When it comes to temporal perception as a function for memory storage, emotions produce high levels of stimulation, guiding us to higher levels of perception and the level of attention implemented in the experience. The experience is highlighted over time, causing it to be stored at a ""high"" level in the memory list. As for how the perception of the passage of time varies with mood, scientists have investigated the process in experiments. of task completion that linked the propensity to boredom with the perception of the passage of time. Attention to the task at hand was crucial, as people who experienced high levels of boredom with the task at hand were found to be worse at estimating time, while people with low levels of boredom tended to underestimate Over time. If you are well engaged in a task, your high attention and lack of boredom means that you are not constantly occupied with visceral discomfort. So, when you are enjoying and having fun, time feels like it is ""flying"" because attention is drawn. Focus on the task, not on yourself."

la-vista,Simple Dicho: ¿Curiosos sobre la curiosidad? ¿Por qué buscamos respuestas?,Simple Saying: Curious about curiosity? Why do we look for answers?,"Curiosity, the trait of an individual's propensity to obtain new information, is constantly changing. We know it individually; some topics make us want to know more about it, while others bore us to death. Why do some things persuade us? And if curiosity compels us to get new information, what is the purpose of learning, specifically, when it comes to our minds as college students? Even evolutionarily speaking, curiosity is essential. It is observed when obtaining information, a type of childish behavior that creates ""questions of curiosity"". When children encounter things that interest them or do not match preexisting ideas about the world, they gain their knowledge by asking questions. This is a mythical childhood phase when they seem to ask questions about any and many things. Through their endless questions, children can create intuitive theories that help them better predict and interact with the world in which they live. When we develop, we may not need to be asking questions of those around us. But, because we never stop learning, curiosity becomes a useful stage. Scientists researching the relationship between learning and curiosity have found that curiosity translates into better learning outcomes and even better memorization. In a study investigating this relationship, researchers used a trivia question activity to measure participants' curiosity about their answers. It was found that activity within the center of the brain, which is responsible for curiosity, learning, memory and other cognitive functions, was increased when participants incorrectly guessed the answers to trivia questions. When participants were asked the same question a week or two later, higher curiosity questions were associated with better response retention. It was concluded that curiosity improves memory, and with that, facilitates the process of learning new information. So, curiosity is useful for us students to help us remember things better, but what do we know about what makes us curious and what doesn't? In the previous study, why was curiosity about correct answers increased when participants had made mistakes? A popular theory says that incomplete knowledge triggers curiosity. COURTESY OF UNSPLASH.COM Findings from a study using trivia questions, as above, support the theory. The participants were asked questions such as ""which president was the cranberry jam made for?"", and then they were asked to guess with everything they knew, to find out the result of how they guessed them, if they thought they were correct your riddles and your curiosity for the correct answer. When they knew the correct answer, they were asked to indicate how it excited them. When the study researchers analyzed the results, they discovered that curiosity for the correct answer increased when participants believed they were close to learning the information, but had incorrectly guessed the answer. To simply explain the situation you have probably had, it is just like you have accidentally given the details of a test and then discovered that you were wrong because of the question you thought you knew about. Afterwards, they feel that they must know the correct answer to answer the question correctly to accept your erroneous understanding. Finally, the researchers proposed that the advanced thinking of human learning best predicted curiosity, while the amount of knowledge that exists best predicted learning. They also mentioned a paradox of comments: first, the perception of existing knowledge is related to a high curiosity for new information; Second, curiosity is connected to better learning outcomes. By paying attention to this information, we can know why we are curious about the little things we wonder about, but don't have the answers to. As the researchers highlighted, awareness of the current state of knowledge is important. More importantly, however, they highlight that their findings support the idea that learners should provide the idea that is next to the level they have passed. As students, we have no say in the idea we take. But the next time you come across new information, which is different, take the time to identify what it is that you know. Taking it step by step may spark curiosity and make the learning process more fun and less stressful."

The irony of this saying is not lost, after all, with all these ways of communicating and connecting with friends and strangers, the idea that we are still alone sounds truly impossible. Especially when, at any given moment, we can send messages, send emails or dial a mobile number in the same time it takes you to walk down the steps. By the way, I have done all of these things by watching my class videos, taking notes, making breakfast, and communicating with my roommate. The camaraderie of the digital form is practically natural for us, and it does not matter the chores, in tandem with our unnecessary jobs. In fact, communication in the 21st century is obviously asked to be done simultaneously with 2 or 3 other chores: ""calling your boyfriend or girlfriend while shopping, texting a classmate walking to the classroom, and talking to your friend at the same time."" that they haven't seen for years on FaceTime at the same time"" because it's so accessible to us these days. However, the sheer convenience of communicating ""whether it's a 5-second call or a 3-paragraph message"" has had to be a big part of our loneliness. The easier it becomes to connect with our friends, the harder it feels to have a meaningful conversation without accidentally being miscommunicated, baseless conversations that we are accustomed to, thanks to a huge amount of digital communications that are valid for us.

In fact, there are many examples where I am grateful for using my cell phone and its ability to connect with my friends in any state or country.

However, the truth is that the more we like digital intimacy than physical intimacy, the more we connect from afar. And, the more we get used to this way of living, the more neutralized loneliness will become for our future generation. We will continue to live the way that Henry David Thoreau once aptly described, almost 200 years ago: adhering to the saying: ""lives of quiet desperation"", despite all the benefits and possibilities, communication digital has opened up for us. We'll continue to become comfortable saying nothing in particular to anyone until probably all we're missing is our phones and a couple of half-hearted Instagram comments to keep us distracted. Despite the bleak prediction of our future, there are deceptively simple solutions to this problem. The cause of our loneliness is misinterpretation, which is easily remedied by communication that is less dependent on digital communication and more dependent on emotionally significant communication. Whether that's a thoughtful text or a couple of hours of talking on the beach, these are the actions that could save our lives from frightening loneliness. Min Seo Riu believes that a long, busy email keeps loneliness away!"
la-vista,Una Carta para el Editor: La Escritura del Mes de Herencia Hispana,A Letter to the Editor: Hispanic Heritage Writing of the Month,"José Suarez If one were to look up what ""Hispanic"" means, the answers might be less satisfactory (however, to be honest, I don't know if it is also a similar hassle to search for ethnicities). Those who are actually in the world struggle from one question to another, but there are many problems with this premise. Should one let their identity be pigeonholed by the nation where they reside, especially when that nation does not align with their ancestors? But wait, despite being born in the United States and having been living for most of my life in the United States, I'm not an American? I don't feel like it is. But then, do I feel ""Hispanic""? Do I feel Hispanic when I don't remember even the rudimentary history of my homeland because I can't justify learning about it in my college class (since the credits didn't align with what I needed to graduate) or because primary education wasn't focus on it (why would it be?) I feel Hispanic when I grew up speaking Spanish and understanding it, but I still struggle when speaking it with my parents or others because I haven't had many opportunities in my life to practice it since I left home ? In any case, is the undeserved weight that I am Hispanic leaving only the influence of the colonizers on my origin considerable? ""” which I suppose should make me regret wanting to be American. And what about being Chicano? Is it true that that should be more applicable than being American, Hispanic or even Mexican? But, there is always no option to choose it for the government's mandatory forms. Does this make identity (and yet my pure identity) any less valuable? I don't know. I think about my summer internship trip, when I went to the. Skid Row History Museum and I asked the curator, who had expressed himself as a Chicano, what it means to him to be one and if he felt (or felt that he should feel) any remorse for not knowing more or less about our heritage or culture. His response empowered me. and it confused me more than before: ""Who cares"", he told me in a typical way. ""Our identity is what we want it to be and how we want to develop it is a decision that only we can make"" While this gave me. definitely more questions than answers; Finally, your response thanks me ""”what I decide to do will be acceptable, and no one else will be able to judge me.

Many employees are not seen by students who pass by them not trying to see any. landscaping was working outside the departments being completely ignored; he does not receive thanks for his presence. What is common among all these employees is their Latin origin. They work cheerfully and behave cool and funny, but they are still invisible in the eyes of the people. students. So, every morning, before going to class or doing anything, I greet them, noting their hard work. They are remarkable individuals; if you take the time to talk to them, you realize that they want the best for you. . Being notable brings happiness, and I love that employees happily welcome me and bless me with good wishes every day. So, as a Latino at UCSB, invisibility has been our experience, but it should not be this way. We can be as welcome as the employees who have welcomed us."
la-vista,"En Resumen: La Contribución de Metro Boomin a ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse""","In Summary: Metro Boomin's Contribution to ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse""","From teenagers who aspire to be Miles Morales to adults who grew up with the original Spider-Man Tobey Maguire, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" has something for everyone. Even following the popularity of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", making an equally impressive sequel was not a task for the faint of heart. After 4 years of processing animation, composing and recording, the sequel met countless expectations. The film itself has received favorable reviews with 95 percent of people and has won the 2023 Hollywood Film Critics Association Mid-Season Best Film Award. Likewise, the soundtrack produced by Metro Boomin and Daniel Pemberton It's an amazing addition to this must-see movie. Courtesy of The Hollywood Reporter While the addition of film soundtracks is nothing new, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” offers a whole new rap-influenced scene among other animated films. Some of the most influential rappers in this generation are featured “”A$AP Rocky, 21 Savage, Lil Wayne, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, Offset, Future, Lil Uzi Vert”” on Metro Boomin’s album, “METRO BOOMIN PRESENTS SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE"". The amount of chronicles with the album takes the concept of collaboration to a whole new level. Even with many individuals featured, the soundtrack is still able to maintain a cohesive and amazing sound. It holds itself well by also improving the aesthetics and plot of the film itself. Metro Boomin's album starts off great with its first song, ""Annihilate"", which features Swae Lee, Lil Wayne and Offset. It is used at the moment when Morales begins to be the most important character in the film. The rhythm is strong and intense, making it part of the climatic moment. The song is great because of its amazing lyrics with references from other Spider-Man movies, like ""I give an opp arachnophobia / I've been litty since I flicked the lighter / Since I was an itsy bitsy spider."" Not only is it full of references, but the chorus is also one that will never escape many people's ears. The chorus also has incredibly catchy lyrics that will always have listeners leaving the auditorium singing ""Annihilate, I""™m. wide awake, be very afraid / I""™m in my own world, give me space / I""™m in my own universe, give me space"". The first song is a great start to start such a fantastic album, and by the way, the following ones do not disappoint anyone. Another amazing song on the soundtrack is “Calling” which features Swae Lee, NAV and A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, is used in the credits of the film and is also a cool addition to the entire album. The song incorporates a ""Rhythm and Blues"" artist group feel contrasting with much of the rap influence seen on the album. The song has a beautiful, flowing piano melody and shows the sympathetic side of Morales' story, specifically his relationship with Gwen Stacy. It's an excellent thought with scruples about being a superhero and wanting to protect those he loves: ""I can hear you screamin""™ out, callin""™ me / It""™s my fault, made you fall for me / So, to save you, I""™d give my all"". The moving lyrics are powerful and demonstrate why the song is the most streamed on the entire album, with 120,000 views and counting. The creators of ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" and the collaborators of Metro Boomin's album have combined to create a fantastic film and soundtrack that equals and improves upon each other. Although the songs are great and suitable for children's entertainment, they still incorporate many elements of hip-hop, R&B (Rhythm and blues) and rap. The album's work was able to transform genres that are not normally for children into a very amazing soundtrack for a family film. It's incredibly cohesive, and the songs are amazingly suited to the scenes used throughout the film. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a movie that people of all ages will enjoy with audio tracks. that everyone can sing."
la-vista,Panaderí­a de Santa Bárbara celebra el Dia de los Muertos con pan respaldado de siglos de tradición,Santa Barbara Bakery celebrates Dia de los Muertos with bread backed by centuries of tradition,"It's time to eat bread of the dead! There are several traditions for the Day of the Dead and my favorite is going to the bakery with my mom to choose the bread of the dead that we are going to eat. But have you ever wondered where bread of the dead comes from? Julie Broch / El Nexo Diario Although it is common to think that bread of the dead was a tradition started by Mexicans, the origin comes from the Aztecs. Actually, it's a bit of a dark story. The Aztecs sacrificed a woman of noble stature to please the gods. They used the woman's blood and mixed it with amaranth to make bread. Some legends say that the community ate the bread in a ceremony and other legends said that the priest in charge of the ceremony ate the bread to keep the gods happy. This is obviously not how bread is made today and that is because the Spanish priests of the Catholic religion decided that the rituals were too wild and instead began making wheat bread following the design of a heart. They sprinkled a little red sugar on top to represent the woman's blood. This type of bread is called puff pastry. Each region of Mexico has its own way of making bread of the dead. In larger states, puff pastry is the most common bread of the dead. But in regions that have higher indigenous populations, the breads are more detailed and unique. In Oaxaca, the tradition is to make bread decorated with lines of cream that represent the human body and a small figurehead made of flour and water that represents the head. The figurehead is usually painted with detail and comes in various colors. Maybe the cream has sprinkles of color on top that makes it look more festive. Typically bakers make another type of bread to represent and honor children who have died. They make different designs such as chicks, rabbits and dolls to represent toys and put them in the offering. One of several bakeries selling pan de muerte this fall is Los Tarascos Bakery and Deli located at 314 East Haley Street. Owned by Enoch Brojas since 2007, the bakery specializes in sweet breads, cakes, pastries and other baked goods. But it was not until 2010, after three years of operating Los Tarascos, that Brojas began selling bread of the dead for the community of Santa Bárbara, after receiving requests from several customers. Since then, the demand for the sweet bread has grown. Each year the bakery sells 600 to 800 panes de muerte between the end of October and the beginning of November in addition to fulfilling special orders for events in Santa Barbara. Available in small, medium, and large loaves, Brojas' recipe is a little different from the traditional pan de muerte sold in Mexico. Because stores in Santa Barbara do not sell the special orange essence used in Mexican bread of the dead, the alternative that Brojas uses is butter and anise for flavor. The first step in creating flavorful bread of the dead is making the mace. Then the orange flavor and butter are added before the dough is transformed into the different figure of bread of the dead and left to rest for one to three hours. Traditionally, bread of the dead is decorated with sugar powder, but Brojas wanted to offer a less sweet option, so another bread option is sold with a sesame seed glaze. Los Tarascos' pan de muerte is large enough to serve two people and is sold at the affordable price of $2.50 per loaf. We tried both kinds of pan de muerte, enjoying every bite of the fluffy, sugary bread and our fingers were full of pink sugar afterwards. Los Tarascos is the only bakery in Santa Barbara that offers a vegan pan de muerte and was inspired by another restaurateur in the area. Dalan Moreno of Rascal""™s Vegan, owner of the vegan Mexican restaurant located on the same street as Los Tarascos, asked Brojas in 2020 to try some of his homemade vegan conchas. Brojas offered to modify the pan dulce recipe of Los Tarascos to be totally vegan and so that the bakery could supply vegan bread for Rascal""™s Vegan. Three years later, Los Tarascos has kept the conchas and vegan bread of the dead on the menu and bakes it fresh every Tuesday. This year, Rascal""™s and Los Tarascos collaborated to create the Vegan Pan de Muerto Relleno which consists of Los Tarascos's vegan bread of the dead filled with dairy-free whipped cream and homemade jam that was served during the last two weeks of October at Rascal"" ™s. Los Tarascos are only offering bread of the dead for a short time, so we suggest using Día de Los Muertos as an excuse to visit this hidden gem. The tradition of eating pan de Muerto is not only accompanied by centuries of history, but is essential in celebrating the Day of the Dead, with each regional variation of Pan de Muerto adding more richness to the holiday."
la-vista,¿Sabes qué es una Calaverita Literaria?,Do you know what a Literary Skull is?,"Literary Calaveras are short verses or poems that use satirical language that are typically used to mock a character, usually related to death. It is customary to add an image or some type of visual representation, such as a calaca or a catrina with a colorful outfit. More than anything, these small pieces allow people to stop fearing death and see it from a comic side, for example by representing death with ""La Calaca"" or ""La Huesuda"". In a celebrating way instead of mourning and grieving. You probably think this practice sounds disturbing, but it is important to remember its cultural importance in Mexican culture and its collective memory. By writing these Calaveritas they celebrate the lives of their loved ones who have passed away, as well as using these times to reflect on life and death.

la-vista,Adentro de la Neblina,Inside the Mist,"He had almost never stayed on campus at night. He always got on the truck before the sun went down. I knew that the truck always filled up when night came, and the lights didn't illuminate enough. Now he had to stay, because he was going to see a meeting in the creative studies building. Although he was going to leave in the dark, he wanted to relax when he told himself that now he was going to have time to return to his apartment. She took out her phone and checked the messages her friend sent. Are we still going to meet at the lagoon? I read the message. Yes, I leave around 7:15.
Well, I'll wait for you here. On the bench in front of the UCen. Oh see you. But leaving the meeting something different happened. He never thought how much fog he would see. He adjusted his jacket, and started walking. If it was all sunny with almost no clouds, how could you hardly even see the lights at this moment? Analisa began to think that her friend was waiting for her. Her friend had told her that the lagoon was beautiful at night. At this point, it can no longer be cancelled. Because as he went to the steps, he stopped. Remembering a story he heard since his freshman year. The lagoon had animals, ducks most of all. And the fog was something that happened a lot at UCSB as it was next to the sea. A classmate told him that one night he started running. A foggy afternoon. Even though he had his hearing aids, he began to hear voices. First some murmurs, which he thought might be part of the music. It wasn't until he could no longer see the lights that he fell silent. Now yes, a voice shouting at him. Loud, demanding that he hear her. He tried to stop again, and the fog knocked him down. Initially, some told him it was just wind. But another girl, more separated, came closer and told him that something lives in the mist. And it's good that he ran as soon as he could. Because the fog was the sign. It wants to catch you, if you approach the fog. But I could barely see the water. What beauty, how little light could be reflected in the lagoon. He walked a little, the only thing you could hear were his footsteps. It's good that he had put on tennis shoes for this already half-wet sand. When I turned to see the UCen, it was all dark. I couldn't find the bank. She shouted her friend's name. Nothing. 
What did happen was the fog moving. ""Are you there?"" He carried the voice of a wind that passed him. Shaking his hair and cooling his face. He put his hand in his bag, and nothing was felt. He lowered his backpack, opening the zipper and moving his things around to find it. ""I feel lonely."" They told her. His hand froze inside the bag. Abandoning finding his cell phone, he stood up. ""Do you really want to scare me?"" Analisa asked. ""Do you like the lagoon too?"" ""I've already jumped!"" ""Can't you see me?"" He was turning around, looking for the lights of the UCen, the lamps, but what he focused on, They were a pair of bright eyes. Gold color, in the distance. Almost on the water. Or on the dock made of plastic. ""Who are you?"" She said softly. ""I love the lagoon. On these nights, the water invites you."" The voice vibrated, hearing it from the right and then from the left. Finally, he collided with the bench. And the eyes came closer, head twisted in the darkness. Almost in front of her. ""Someone new to accompany me in the fog."" A few steps behind, Analisa's cell phone was fallen. Timbro, for a second reflecting the new message. Hey, so I'm already standing next to the library. Where are you?"
la-vista,Dia de los Muertos: Una celebración,Day of the Dead: A celebration,"Honoring the dead and deceased can be observed in different ways throughout the world. There are many cultures that dedicate a few moments a year to celebrate the lives of people who have died. In Latin America one of the most spectacular and beautiful traditions is seen in the month of October and November with the Day of the Dead celebrations. La Vista hosts the opening of its ofrenda for the Dia de los Muertos celebration with activities and food. Maddy Fangio / El Nexo Diario As autumn begins to take hold in October, families begin to prepare to receive the souls of their loved ones who, according to popular culture, travel from their place of rest to spend a few days with their loved ones. family and loved ones. Cempasuchitl flowers fill the markets and streets with a unique smell, families prepare themselves with the favorite foods of their deceased, and they also prepare spiritually to welcome the souls of their loved ones into their homes.
A misconception that regularly arises around these dates is that the Day of the Dead is a single day, and in reality it is not. These celebrations are held over a series of days that focus on specific groups of individuals and traditions are carried out throughout the days according to the souls that arrive. Making an altar allows you to let your creativity run wild and add personal elements that apply to your own family traditions, however there are certain elements that are necessary for the offering to be complete. Maddy Fangio / El Nexo Diario It is believed that the journey of the deceased begins on October 27 with the arrival of those pets and animals that died and are honored by their owners. October 28 is dedicated to people who died in an unforeseen and abrupt accident. The souls of the deceased who have been forgotten are honored on October 29 and it is customary to provide these souls with a glass of water. October 31 is dedicated to the dead of the dead, that is, to the great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents and others who are part of the family. Little boys and girls who died are honored on November 1, on this day it is customary to put sweets, cakes, games and other things that have been significant in their life and please them now in death.
November 2 is for the faithful deceased, that is, for all adults, it is the day where offerings are made that they would appreciate, such as tequila, cigarettes, etc.
It is important to emphasize that these dates may change depending on the area, and the traditions that each family follows.
Apart from making an offering to the deceased, it is customary to visit and watch the cemetery as a family and accompany your deceased loved ones. The cemeteries are filled with color, music and memories that keep family ties strong, even after death. A view of our offering. Maddy Fangio / The Daily Nexus The Offering
If you have had the opportunity to make a Day of the Dead altar, you will know that it is not an easy task; it has many fundamental pieces that play a very important role in the journey of your ancestors and loved ones.
This tradition has different variations throughout the world, but the main idea is that when you dedicate an altar to people who have died, their souls return and are able to spend a few days with their relatives in the form of spirits.
Making an altar allows you to let your creativity run wild and add personal elements that apply to your own family traditions, however there are certain elements that are necessary for the offering to be complete. Photographs: As the movie Coco teaches us, photographs are a fundamental piece so that the people to whom the altar has been dedicated can enjoy their offering. Candles: The flame of a candle means ""light"", faith and hope. This is a guide with the purpose that the souls can reach their old places and light the return to their home. Incense: In addition to producing a calming smell, it is used to cleanse the place of evil spirits so that the soul can enter your home without any danger. Cempasúchil Flowers: In many places in the country it is customary to put paths of petals that serve to guide the deceased from the holy field to the offering and vice versa due to their color and smell that trace the routes to the souls. Food and water: The food is intended to delight the dead who visit the offering, it is cooked in honor of the remembered beings, so it is customary to put their favorite food and drink. The water in the offering is intended to comfort and quench the thirst of the deceased, since, in the pre-Hispanic worldview, the dead travel a long journey from Mictlán. After November 2nd the food can be consumed. Salt: Salt symbolizes the purification of the soul of the deceased. It is also said that this helps to drive away evil spirits from the home, so that only the presence of loved ones is received. Sugar Skulls: Sweet skulls are given the name of a close person or oneself, in order for them to be eaten and thus eat one's own death and thus reject this reality. They can be made of chocolate, sugar or have some type of filling. Bread, in this case shells, is used to nourish our deceased after their long journey. Maddy Fangio / The Daily Nexus There are many ways altars can be personalized to honor specific people. Whether it's a pet, a handful of kibble, a musical instrument for your favorite artist who has passed away, or some significant piece of your loved one. Our Portraits: We remember them and their love and it reminds us that death is not the end""“ it never has been. Maddy Fangio / El Nexo Diario I'm not that religious, I haven't been for a long time, but I honor this sacred tradition. Death is scary, not knowing what happens or why it's scary. I could talk endlessly about how unfair it is and send me on a downward spiral, but beliefs and traditions like these are what keep me afloat. The Dead allows us to welcome and accept death instead of fearing it. Losing a loved one is one of the most devastating feelings. It is not a single moment, but rather the grief and absence of them that is felt. rest of life. You think they are gone forever and my years away from religion have cemented that idea. But at the beginning of this season, and I start to see the colors, oranges, purples, and reds, and the hundreds of people. gathered at an altar, cemeteries filled with people bringing with them a radiant joy, drawing laughter, and longing together in a dance that we all participate in. We tell the stories of their lives, we put on their favorite things and we bring them back to life. The grief felt over his departure is resolved for one afternoon. We remember them and their love and it reminds us that death is not the end""“ it never has been. In moments when I feel disconnected, when I miss the meows of my first cat, when the grief of thinking about the life that would have If I had met my grandparents before she passed away, when I remember my childhood friend, it's hard to believe that I have become a new person and they don't know her. But I can't deny the feelings I have. They arrive when I see their photos in the offering, when I sit and think about who they were, imagine what my grandparents would tell me. I think they would be proud of the woman I have become, and I sit down to accompany them. Sweets, shells and more they were. shared among friends and students. Maddy Fangio / El Nexo Diario I perfectly remember the first altar we made in my house. It was the year we moved to Mexico and although I knew a little about the tradition, I did not understand the importance of this tradition.
We prepared months before, going to the market in the center, buying fruits, bread of the dead, flowers and the ingredients to make tamales, and mixiotes. We also bought shredded paper and decorations to make our altar more colorful. The weekend before the holidays, my family and I went to the cemetery where my mom's brother was buried. They were sometimes sad moments because you could see the sadness in my mother and her parents' eyes, but the colors and smells of the cempasuchitl flowers, the musicians who played songs at the entrance to the pantheon and the families cleaning and arranging the tombs of their loved ones gave me a nice feeling. It gave me peace to know that even after death, people do not die completely but rather a piece of our essence remains on earth with the people we love and who love us.
At our first altar we followed the rules we needed to follow to ensure our loved ones could come into the world without a problem. Our house smelled like cempasuchitl flowers for days, and the candles we held every morning were a reminder that we were not alone, our ancestors and loved ones were there. One of the lessons that these days leave me is to appreciate life, appreciate the people you love and not waste moments letting them know what they are important to you while they are on earth, until death dictates otherwise or in this case, until next November 2."
la-vista,La conveniencia costosa de entrega de alimentos y una visión por comprar localmente,The expensive convenience of food delivery and a vision for shopping locally,"In a pinch, I can't help but order food for delivery on an app. It's so convenient for so many reasons - there's no prep, no cooking, no cleaning, no tupperware of meal prep in a refrigerator I share with six classmates trying to do the same thing. As a student, there's the benefit of being able to work without interruption and hopefully going to sleep at a healthy time. With classes scattered chaotically in the morning and late at night and late deadlines all week, a $7 delivery fee plus $2 tip for a $14 sandwich is almost justifiable. But unfortunately, the convenience offered by delivery services in their current form is inseparable from their unsustainability for the health and well-being of their users, the environment and the community. The first thing I see when I open these applications is a. screen filled with ads for popular restaurants in Isla Vista, especially for fast food. Fast food is extremely popular on delivery services like DoorDash, UberEats, and Grubhub. Fast food companies are wasting money to advertise on these platforms. Marketing Brew reports that DoorDash earned $3 billion in ad sales to merchants and Uber Eats projects $1 billion. Advertising spending by restaurant chains, according to Statista, shows the dominance of fast food chains, causing advertising platforms for food delivery services to create an incentive structure that benefits the food industry the most. fast food. Honestly, my roommates and I often opt for fast food. However, according to a study published in 2014 from the Department of Health and Management Police, Fielding School of Public Health, UC Los Angeles, ""[Adults] exposed to food advertising chose 28% more unhealthy snacks."" than those who were exposed to non-food advertising with a total caloric value 65 kcal higher. Food advertising is inserted in our home screen and search results on these platforms, so promoting ready-made rabuda food encourages the public to eat. more gusguerias. The expense associated with food delivery services is double. First, the consumer pays for the delivery fee plus the tip in addition to the subtotal of the order. Second, food delivery applications increase their prices for national chains like Panda. Express and local restaurants. Popular delivery platforms like DoorDash and UberEats have a delivery commission of 15 to 30% depending on the tier the merchant subscribes to; A higher tier generates more benefits, such as larger delivery areas, discoverability, and access to ""high-value"" customers who pay for premium consumer experiences like DashPass and Uber One. Ultimately, it's a compromise between expenses and reaches clientele. The sudden growth in popularity of food delivery services may have been a successful temporary remedy during the height of the pandemic, but their continued popularity is unsustainable for restaurants with fewer diners due to the added expenses of delivery. In its current state, food delivery is incompatible with the business model of many restaurants. By addressing each of these issues, UC Santa Barbara can nurture and support community-driven initiatives to support affordable, convenient, healthy and sustainable ways to make food available to students ""“ methods that are convenient for students and provide a realistic option for our busy schedules. Food delivery companies can support local businesses and improve affordability by prioritizing local restaurants over nationally recognized chains, which can be achieved by promoting local restaurants in their algorithms. search and promotion. By prioritizing local restaurants, they are not forced to adopt unsustainable business models or risk alienating customers. We can also take inspiration from some communities that have developed competing platforms that prioritize supporting local businesses, such as the restaurant cooperative. 937 Delivers that was active during the pandemic in Dayton, Ohio. The Candlestick Courier Collective based out of San Francisco is another delivery co-op that is operated by the riders who deliver the food. ""We're working with local businesses because the main goal is to put money back into our pockets, into the pockets of the restaurants, into the community,"" co-owner Tasha Rose said in an interview. But making food delivery services cheaper doesn't necessarily promote sustainable eating. To do that, we as a community need to support and expand initiatives to make sustainable grocery shopping accessible and affordable for UCSB students. We have to align sustainability and convenience for students. Shopping locally is an effective and ecologically sustainable approach to grocery shopping. According to a 2012 Columbia Climate School article, buying locally grown food has environmental, economic, and social benefits. Nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers used to grow feed in California can be sent overseas for livestock in New York. Livestock fed this feed produce manure rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, which can contribute to nutrient pollution due to runoff containing the excess. However, nutrients that are cycled locally would not produce excess in this way. Buying locally also keeps money flowing into the community and supports local businesses, which keeps the community local and prevents it from becoming a “ghost town” or a “clone town”. These terms describe neighborhoods without local businesses or one that appears occupied by chains and companies. Shopping from local markets provides a way for the student population to be environmentally conscious while supporting the community economically and protecting our identity. Initiatives that prioritize students may make shopping from a local and sustainable market more convenient in Isla Vista. UCSB Basic Needs runs several food and grocery assistance programs for students on and off campus. The Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank is open five days a week on the University Center campus and supports more than 3,000 students weekly. Since they are an A.S. initiative, are financed with our donations and student fees. CalFresh is another federally funded program that provides up to $281 per month to spend on food. The I.V. Food Co-op is a food cooperative in Isla Vista that highlights its commitment to the community by supporting local farms and producers. Because it is a cooperative, students and other community members have the opportunity to own it and be directly involved. Because they are not-for-profit, cooperatives can be left without access to the capital necessary to grow and require active community participation for their operations. However, the I.V. Food Co-op showed how these limitations can be overcome with their inspiring story of purchasing the land they are on through a completely community-driven fundraiser in 2012 for the We Own It Project. A new Collaboration with local farms and sustainable food initiatives on campus could create a student-friendly on-campus market for locally grown foods, similar to Columbia University's Columbia Sunday Greenmarket. Complementing the Santa Barbara Farmers Market at Camino Real Marketplace in Goleta during the weekend, a market that sources from local farms may operate weekly on the UCSB campus. Students can shop during a break between classes instead of spending an entire afternoon. This initiative can reinforce and strengthen the relationship between UCSB, Isla Vista students and the Santa Barbara community at large. Being able to see where the food I buy comes from, who grows it, and supporting a local business are privileges I would love to have as a member of this community. Therefore, the spirit of reflection as we begin this academic year should be to consider how convenience is powerful and how we can harness it to encourage us to live a sustainable lifestyle.

la-vista,Mi mamá dijo: Desmitificando el VapoRub,My mom said: Demystifying VapoRub,"A remedy passed down for generations, VapoRub has been a part of my life since before I was aware. I remember sleeping covered from head to toe in this gelatinous substance and waking up almost completely healed. I think this remedy is known to every Hispanic family. With the ""vaporú"" on my feet, chest, back, even in my armpits, I slept curled up in socks, warm pajamas and large blankets ""“ you know the ones I'm talking about. Although I was super uncomfortable, I slept long and deep and I woke up relieved and sometimes sticky. But how does it work? VapoRub is a topical pain reliever that relieves minor pain in the musculoskeletal system like Tiger Balm does. The ingredients in VapoRub like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil are cough suppressants and topical pain relievers. Essential oils create a cooling effect which hides the feeling of congestion and pain, that is, to reduce sleep disturbances when you have the flu. In the same way that rubbing your knee helps it heal after getting hurt, applying VapoRub helps. a counter-stimulation which replaces the pain of a swollen throat or the discomfort of congestion, tricking your brain. Although it sounds like a placebo, a study done in 2017 that explored the effectiveness of topical pain relievers found that applying VapoRub before. Going to sleep has a positive effect on the perceived quality of sleep for adults suffering from flu symptoms. Products like Vaporub can be used as a distraction to cough and congestion, but they cannot relieve your symptoms alone. In this example, it may help you with undisturbed sleep which has great implications for the overall recovery process but alone could not completely alleviate it. That's where they get help from over-the-counter medicines or where they start collecting home remedies from their grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and great-great-grandmothers. COURTESY OF FLICKR Another factor to consider is the role of VapoRub's scent in the ""recovery process"". According to the 2013 Korean study in the journal Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, people who had knee replacements reported less pain (and reduced blood pressure) after inhaling eucalyptus vapors. The resplendent scent of eucalyptus is used in a variety of aromatherapies that support the respiratory system and relieve physical discomfort. Eucalyptus contains Î±-pinene and 1,8-cineole and acts as an antioxidant that inhibits the secretion of cytokines by T lymphocytes, a protein crucial in controlling the growth and activity of other cells in the immune system and blood. Because of this, it helps in the form of VapoRub ointment to temporarily combat pain. There may also be psychological effects. In my family VapoRub is considered a panacea. VapoRub is used for everything: cough, pain, congestion, treatment for fungus, head injuries, broken bones and many more things that my mother could list for you. That said, the smell of VapoRub immediately reminds me of the times of childhood where my mom would cuddle me before going to sleep. As soon as I smell VapoRub I hear my mom's voice telling me all the ways I can use VapoRub, even if it's physical pain or anxiety, it always healed me. In those times I knew that although I felt terrible, I was snotty and snoring, my mom took care of me with her magic ointment and a verse of ""sana sana colata de rana"".

la-vista,Ex-empleado de Subway revela las mejores combinaciones de sándwiches,Former Subway Employee Reveals Best Sandwich Combinations,"Zoe Gonzales / El Nexo Diario Subway is the perfect lunch for students. With two convenient campus locations—one in the Arbor and one in the University Center. As a former sandwich artist, I've had the privilege of creating countless sandwiches, and I'm here to spill the beans (or ingredients) about of the best combinations that will leave you completely satisfied. Subway offers an abundance of pre-selected combinations, but these are my own creations that I have put together through my own trial and error. All of these sandwiches come toasted, as they should be. The names of these four sandwiches are not official from Subway. As long as you follow the numbered instructions, you will get the combo you want. “Supreme Melted Tuna Sandwich” You can't go wrong with a tuna sandwich. a popular meat option, but few people ordered it the way I like it. It is vital to toast the sandwich without the tuna. The price is $8.90 for six inches and $12.90 for a full foot. “Underrated Grilled Delight” This is my favorite and I order it almost every time. Chicken was never popular during my time there, which I still don't understand. It's easily my favorite meat at Subway. This sandwich costs $8.90 for a six-inch slice and $13.90 for a full foot. ""Classic Turkey with Bacon"" Another popular meat option is turkey. Personally, I find turkey on its own to be too unsalted for a sandwich. However, I think it pairs perfectly with the bacon, which adds a nice savory flavor and texture. Order a six-inch sandwich for $10.80, or $14.80 for a full foot. “Piece of Pizza” This is complicated and some Subway employees may not agree to do it for you. But if you ask nicely, you might have a chance. The bread itself is quite filling, enough to compete with Dominos or Pizza Hut. With the ingredients that Subway offers, the following is my favorite combination. If you're lucky, they'll only charge you for one serving of pepperoni with mozzarella cheese. This costs $9.80 for a six inch and $14.80 for a full foot. If not, they'll charge you the price of a meatball marinara, plus extra pepperoni AND extra mozzarella. In that case, it might be the most expensive sandwich on this list at $11.70 and $16.70 for a six-inch and a full foot, so keep that in mind. Ordering from Subway for the first time is notoriously stressful, we all know this. Many people don't understand that the cost of the sandwich usually depends only on the size of the bun and the type of meat you order. All other vegetables are free, except avocado. Hopefully, this list gives you an idea of ​​what you might order at Subway, down to the type of bread and sauces. Î” Î”

la-vista,Latina en museos locales: Mi experiencia,Latina in local museums: My experience,"As an art history student in museum studies, I have been fortunate to be able to intern in the education department of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art (SBMA) through the Santa Barbara Museum of Art and Design internship program. UCSB (AD&A). During my participation in this internship I have had the opportunity to go to different types of artistic events that are related to the exhibitions that are on display at the museum. Museums are defined as places where significant pieces of art and cultural importance are preserved and stored; music, poetry, dance, and other artistic expressions are also part of this cultural heritage. The Pop-Up opera that took place on October 5 at the main doors of the museum is one of the ways that other artistic performances are included in the world of museums. Opera singers from the group ""Opera Santa Barbara"" delighted people walking along State Street. With each new song, the singers attracted a crowd of listeners who took photos and recorded the powerful voices. They sang popular songs like ""Carmen"", ""Figaro"", my favorite, ""Bésame Mucho"" and many more. It was impressive to see how people were surprised that just a few feet from the main entrance of the museum they were singing opera. One of my favorite events took place on October 24, when artist Narciso Martinez was invited to give a talk about some of his works that are currently on display at the SBMA. What makes his work so notable and unmatched is his use of fruit and vegetable boxes found in supermarkets and paints the faces and scenes of undocumented agricultural workers who experience difficult working conditions. Martinez began his talk by telling his story of how he and his family came to work in the fruit fields when he was 20 years old. Although he did not know English, he knew that working in the harvest was very difficult and in his attempt to seek new opportunities he earned his high school diploma, followed by his associate of arts degree. Years later he received his bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, but he didn't stop until he earned his master's degree in Fine Arts in drawing and painting. His recognition was so great that he was awarded the MFA scholarship from the Dedalus Foundation in Painting and Sculpture. Their work highlights what the life of migrants working in the fields is like, and tries to raise awareness about the unfair treatment that these communities experience every day so that fruits and vegetables reach our homes. I was able to hear his story and at the same time get to know him, not as the artist with the impressive piece of art but as a charismatic and kind person. Although I had only met him that same night, his story of improvement as an artist was an inspiration and filled me with great pride to see him succeed. Museums have a tendency to be described as boring places, where you can't talk loudly or touch things, there is always a guard watching from afar. If you are curious to experiment, play, or are inspired to create art, visit the SBMA Family Resource Center. The family resource center is located across the doors from the museum's gift shop on State Street. This space is free and is dedicated to carrying out various artistic activities that include any type of craft related to the collections and exhibitions found in the museum. Adapted to visitors of any age and artistic experience, the FRC offers its services every Thursday from 5:00 to 7:00 pm and Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 to 4:00 pm. Upon entering this room you will meet a teaching artist from the museum who will explain the different activities you could do. Take this time to learn more about the exhibits that are open, this knowledge is something that has to be shared with the community and who knows, maybe you will be surprised to discover something new. This resource is a good opportunity to go with your friends to create art together and take home a souvenir of your visit to the center. This article would not be complete without including the resources that are available to students and locals who volunteer to visit the museum. If you receive SNAP you have your entry ticket to hundreds of museums in your hands. The ""Museums for All"" program provides free or reduced-price admission to museums in California to those who receive benefits through SNAP. Only in Santa Barbara, EBT card holders have access to ""Casa de la Guerra"", ""Santa Barbara Historical Museum"", ""El presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park"", ""Museum of Contemporary Art"" , ""Santa Barbara Museum of Art"", among others. Zoe Gonzales / El Nexo Diario As UCSB students, when you show your school ID card, your admission to the SBMA is free. Another important point is that many of the events held at the SBMA are free for students or receive a reduced cost. Most of the events that take place are promoted on the social networks of the museums that interest you, you can also find more information on the official pages of each institution. If you are interested in an event in the future, go with complete confidence that the museum is for you, and your community. On the UCSB campus is the Museum of Art, Design and Architecture (AD&A). It is open from Wednesday to Sunday from 12:00 to 5:00 pm, admission is completely free. It's a great opportunity to visit a museum between classes, or when you need a moment to recharge in the midst of art. Although my experience working in this space has been positive, I hope that future generations of Latinos are empowered to become more and more involved in the world of museums, art, and their cultural heritage. That exhibitions and events are created by and for Latinos and other communities that deserve to have their stories told. There is still a lot of work to do to improve various aspects of museums around the world, starting to open the doors to our Latino community and getting involved in their interests is just the beginning. Most of the events that take place at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art are promoted on the social networks of the museums that interest you, you can also find more information on the official pages of each institution.

Orquídeas has fourteen songs that touch on and explore different genres of music, from pop, reggaeton, R&B, trap rhythms and even merengue. If you are a continuous Kali listener then you will notice that this album and its songs are almost entirely in Spanish. Having an album in Spanish is one of the objectives that Kali has wanted to achieve. Below is a list of some of the songs from this album: COURTESY OF KALI UCHIS Just like an angel (with Featherweight) This song is perfect if you want to feel ""flirty"", you know, feel pretty with your pink bows in hair.

It easily became a trend on social networks when many were surprised at how good the Peso Pluma verse together with Kali sounds compared to their previous works. Goddess This song hits you with a slow, calming beat with a clear message of what Kali expects or desires from a relationship. May they treat her like a goddess and grant her all her wishes.

Give me a kiss //Muévete Kali Uchis decided in this song to ""deviate"" from the style of music that her fans are used to, and explore merengue. She is faithful to her personal style as a writer and singer but gives her listeners a gateway to merengue. These are some of the several songs that Kali Uchis developed for this new album that she decided to share for the whole world. One has to listen to the album with an open mind to enjoy it 100%. Grab your headphones or speakers, sit back, and let the music enter your soul and take you to a more lyrical place.

la-vista,El origen de la Banda Sinaloense,The origin of the Sinaloense Band,"Growing up in a Mexican family, music has been something we have always listened to since my childhood. I remember the weekends when my mother would play music on the speaker when we did chores and our tasks became more fun. Mexican music is one of my favorites since there is a diversity of styles based on the different regions of Mexico. For Mexicans, music is something very important for our culture since when there is a family gathering there is always music and it brings us all together. Music is never lacking at parties, such as patron saint festivities, quinceañeras, weddings, baptisms, etc. For me, the Sinaloan band is one of my favorite bands to listen to since it always sets the mood at any event and always makes everyone start dancing. COURTESY OF Wikimedia Commons Some bands from Sinaloa that I like to listen to are; Banda Corona del Rey, Banda El Recodo and La Arrolladora Banda El Limón. There are many more that are not so popular but listening to any band makes the atmosphere anywhere. The Banda El Recodo is considered ""The Mother of All Bands"" since they have made the Sinaloan band popular in Mexico and internationally. The origin of the Sinaloan band begins in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico since it was born and became popular there. But in reality ""it has its roots in the cultural fusion that occurred between the German immigrants of the 18th and 19th centuries and the local traditions of Sinaloa"" which I always thought was done by Mexicans and without any foreign influence. The style of the Sinaloa band ""combines European wind and string instruments with Mexican melodies."" A Sinaloan band consists of 10-16 musicians who play various wind and percussion instruments, such as trumpets, trombones, clarinets, saxophones, tubas and snare drums, among others. The music of a Sinaloan band is happy, energetic and very popular at parties and celebrations. For many Sinaloans and Mexicans this form of music is an integral part of regional identity and is considered a symbol of pride for many Sinaloans. The Sinaloan band is not only appreciated for its lively and festive music, but they also play an important role in community life and in celebrating various occasions. Recently there is a controversy over a video in which ""foreign tourists were having an acoustic concert on a terrace on the edge of the beach, which was interrupted by a band that began playing on the sand a few meters away"" this made that tourists would get upset. The hotel zone in Mazatlán made a statement for a ban on bands on the beaches on March 27. This affects the musicians since they depend on the plays on the beaches by hour or song. This resulted in Sinaloans coming together to protest against this ban since Sinaloan gangs help the economy of Mazatlán and are jobs for Sinaloans. The beaches of Mazatlán have always been the area for bands playing on the coast; more than a tourist attraction, it is part of the fundamental essence of the Mazatlán community. Not only in Mazatlán do we see the influence of foreigners to gentrify areas but also circumstances that are being seen throughout Mexico.

la-vista,Corridos: ¿Legado de orgullo o violencia?,Corridos: Legacy of pride or violence?,"One of the most prominent Mexican musical genres of the moment is being redefined in the eyes of the musical world. I'm talking about the runs. Those songs that our grandparents and great-grandparents listened to in their generation have been being redefined since they originated. Since their creation in the 19th century, corridos have been a fundamental part of the history of music. Nowadays there are many variations of corridos, from narcocorridos, to corridos tambados, corridos belicos and more. The function of corridos as a musical genre has changed over time; today artists of this genre are transforming its meaning, which has caught the attention of the world. ZOE GONZELES / EL NEXO DIARIO Where do the corridos come from? Corridos originated in Mexico in the 19th century and gained popularity during the Mexican Revolution. The Mexican Revolution was an armed conflict that began in 1910, after thirty years of dictatorship under Porfirio Diaz. In a country in the middle of a revolution, music was used not only as a tool to document injustices, oppression and what a peasant lived on a daily basis but it was also a musical genre that was used to communicate with each other in secret. . The revolutionary heroes were immortalized in ballads and corridos that describe their adventures throughout Mexico. Now immortalized as ""Corridos Histéricos"", this style of music had a great impact on the history of Mexico and the history of music. Today, some of the most notable revolutionary songs on digital platforms that are still heard are ""Adelita"", ""Corrido de Torreón"", ""El Corrido de Pancho Villa"", ""Siete Leguas"" and many more. What do they mean today? Although the story behind the creation of this genre is related to the history of peasant life, oppression and the pride of fighting for your nation, the meaning of a corrido today is very different. The canta-corridos may be inspired by northern songs, and the experiences and homes of the communities living in northern Mexico, as well as life on the border, crossing the experiences of living undocumented in the United States. Narcocorridos also began to become more and more popular in this genre. The stories that these songs touched on now refer to the lives of drug traffickers. Songs about shootings, daring operations, endless money and crime were the themes that were covered in this new stage of the genre. This legacy of the genre has remained marked even years later. Although they are songs that represented part of life in Mexico in a different perspective, for many these topics were taboo, and were something that they thought had to be hidden or not encouraged. Since it was believed that this musical genre instills violence. Among the artists who played an important part in the history of the evolution of corridos include Chalino Sanchez, Ariel Camacho, Valentin Elizalde, Jenni Rivera (in her first albums), among others. Whether singers and artists who represented the violent part of this musical genre were doing well or not, each of them had a significant contribution to the corrido genre. Artist known as Peso Pluma has been one of the singers who has been redefining not only corridos but regional Mexican music. The ""Doble P"" has taken the corridos and added urban and trap music to create a new version of the corridos, a version that demonstrates that the corridos are more than a legacy of violence. In their recent performance at Coachella 2024, Peso Pluma took a moment to play a spoken word interlude that addressed the censorship of narcocorridos, the speaker saying ""the vicious circle in which they were born serves as protection and punishment for them,"" he said while newscasts played on the screen about their songs. ""That's why they will always be on trial."" Not only that, but Featherweight made history by being the first Mexican artist to present a Mexican musical genre at the 2023 VMAs. Not only was it the fact that he was invited, but his presentation itself was a unique experience that shows that corridos contain fundamental and beautiful pieces of music. This genre deserves to be received in these spaces not only given its popularity but also for its contribution to music in all its areas.

la-vista,Como amo ser mujer: Viñetas de feminidad,How I love being a woman: Vignettes of femininity,"We've all heard the iconic phrase ""How I love being a woman"" from the Netflix series ""Anne with an E."" Not only did it become a trend on digital platforms, but it also became a reminder for me, and I believe many, to appreciate how precious, wonderful and magical it is to be a woman in all its forms. If you search on Tik Tok for the phrase ""How I love being a woman"" the search engine will show you hundreds of videos with this concept. The most outstanding are related to finding pleasure and peace in everyday activities that the world does not always allow you to appreciate. Whether it's taking the time in the morning to put on your makeup, or excitedly planning your outfits for class and even spraying on your favorite perfume. And I'll be the first to admit that yes, I love makeup, shopping, and putting on perfume until I smell like walking flowers. However, there is something beyond being a woman that is being omitted by this trend that is important to emphasize. ZOE GONZALES / THE DAILY NEXO Even if the world is not rosy ALL the time, the experience of being a woman becomes completely yours, yours to celebrate, and yours to define. We all have different experiences, difficult and sometimes very complex experiences. Often these experiences are tied to the patriarchal system and its endless rules linked to the world. From excluding women in school and professional fields, to the pink tax, the wage gap that seems to never level out, gender violence, the annulment of legislation protecting women's reproductive rights, etc., etc., etc. I don't have to go on for you to see the whole picture: the world is not easy for women. But hey, that's a discussion for another day. Today I am giving you the opportunity to reflect internally and reconnect with those moments that made you feel with 100% certainty that you love being a woman. Since the world doesn't make it an easy task, the fact that we create these experiences for ourselves is like kicking patriarchy in the face. Being a woman doesn't mean you HAVE to follow a standard, even if the world tells you otherwise. The beauty of being a woman is more than your body, your skin, how you dress or what you are going to do with your life. We see this beauty every day with the women around us. Moments that I remember feeling the phrase ""how I love being a woman"" I feel it when I see my mother, when she smiles when she sees our pets doing something ridiculous and observed her wrinkles around her eyes that were not there the last time I saw her. Or when my sister holds my nephew, the first baby boy in the family, and I know that in this new generation, everything will be different. When I talk for hours on end with my other sister, catching up on all our adventures even though we are 400 miles away. When I'm with my best friends getting ready to go out, lending us last-minute clothes, makeup scattered everywhere, and obviously, taking a million photos before we go out. There are many things that define YOUR identity as a woman, it plays an important role in our lives. Right or wrong, this trend serves as a reminder to reflect on the little things in life that make being a woman a joy.

la-vista,¿Sabí­as que?: Eclipses,Did you know?: Eclipses,"In ancient times, civilizations had several legends to explain the phenomenon of eclipses. Each one had its own rituals to protect its people, to take precautions or to celebrate. The word ""eclipse"" is derived from the ancient Greek base meaning ""abandonment"". They believed that darkness signals the abandonment of the gods. That they were angry with the humans. From this belief are born rites such as giving gifts to appease and worship gods such as the Incas who thought that their sun god, Inti was displaced or the Aztecs, who made human sacrifices to protect themselves from the possibility of the end of the world. In the Chinese language, the word ""eclipse"" is composed of the words ""sun/day"" and ""eat"". Ancient Chinese civilization believed that during solar eclipses, a dragon attempted to swallow the sun and similarly with the moon during lunar eclipses. Other languages ​​have a similar derivation, such as in the ancient Mayan culture, who believed that those responsible for the phenomenon of eclipses were ""celestial demons"" that took the form of insects or snakes. What they were referring to was the planets because they could be seen in the sky during the eclipse. In Egyptian mythology, the sun god Ra was believed to be swallowed by the great serpent Apep, explaining the temporary darkness. In Indian religion, they also give gifts to help the sun gods who are under duress. This rite is still practiced today. In pre-Hispanic culture, it was said that pregnant women had to take precautions during the eclipse for fear of physical problems and discomfort to the baby. To protect the baby, one had to stay at home with a red ribbon tied around the waist. Although many of the explanations for the eclipse were bad omens, there are also those who considered it a good sign. In Arabic astronomy, some prophets explained that solar and lunar eclipses are cosmic spectacles that demonstrate the power and knowledge of Allah. There is no doubt that these celestial phenomena are incredibly pleasant and provocative!

la-vista,En defensa del feminismo bimbo en el mundo académico: el derecho de la mujer a la mediocridad,In defense of bimbo feminism in the academic world: a woman's right to mediocrity,"Like a girl who likes to dress like her fantasy video game character whenever possible, on the day she goes to the mechanic. In all my years, I have never felt less of a feminist than when I am dressed very femininely and staring at someone who asks me what the make and model of my car is. I feel like the stereotype: the dumb, overdressed girl who doesn't know anything about cars. The worst part is that I don't even have a witty comeback, a ""gotcha"" moment like in ""Legally Blonde"" where I prove that I'm competent. I feel, as the kids say, a bimbo. For those of you who are not chronically connected to the internet, the traditional definition of a bimbo is a derogatory term that refers to a girl who is hyperfeminine, hypersexual, and unintelligent. Bimbo feminism, therefore, is the idea that it is okay to be a bimbo. ALLISON HUANG / THE DAILY NEXO Recently, we've seen a rise in trends like ""splaining things to girls"" (inflation is when, for example, if all girls receive nice diamond rings, diamond rings are no longer as specials), ""math for girls"" (I did spend $15 on groceries during the week, which is cheaper than going out to eat, so today I can buy a coffee and it's basically free!) and ""im just a girl"" (yes, my most played song last year is ""Karma"" by Tyalor Swift featuring Ice Spice and what's up with that? I'm literally just a girl). For the vast majority of people, that's all it is: making jokes here and there that poke fun at one's own leaps of logic, strange mistakes, and lack of knowledge on a topic. Over the past few months, these jokes have infiltrated the language of my friend group. However, this general trend has come under a lot of criticism for infantilizing women, reinforcing stereotypes, being another form of choice feminism, being anti-intellectualist, etc. Perhaps some of this is well-deserved, but the speech is almost overwhelmingly one-sided. If this is the case, why are I and so many other people so drawn to it? While it's far from perfect, I think bimbo feminism is a lot more nuanced than people realize. By promoting the hyper-feminine aesthetic and pinks of the early 2000s, bimbo feminism struck a chord with a population of women who are experiencing incredible pressure as they move into historically male-dominated spaces because it gives them a place in feminism to make mistakes: to be loud and bad and still be okay. No, it's not only cool, it's iconic. For a woman to be taken seriously in a male-dominated field, she not only has to perform as well as her male counterparts, she has to perform better. Study after study shows that women continue to work more and earn less, even after taking into account factors such as job choice and hours worked. In fact, as soon as a field becomes more dominated by women, the average salary drops. For every man who is applauded for having a favorite philosopher (""you know, I like them all""), there is a girl who read Voltaire in the original French and still has to get her philosophy degree for people to believe her. For many women, mediocrity is not an option. To be respected you must be, without a doubt, the absolute best. Insert monologue from the movie ""Barbie"" here. Suddenly, my gender performance is suffocating. I can't be feminine and take myself seriously if I'm not also the smartest person in every room I walked into that day. There is little room for the expression of femininity in academia unless you are the archetype of Elle Woods. Bimbo feminism is a complete 180 degree turn. He throws away any kind of expectation of perfection in favor of brazen confidence, regardless of his actual qualifications. Relieve some of the intense shame that comes with not proving yourself. The greatest attraction of bimboism is not its stupidity, but the freedom to speak loudly and make mistakes. If patriarchy is an unstoppable force, bimboism is the immovable object. Now, I'm not actively encouraging people to show up to their 8 a.m. section. m. in a bikini (although if you wanted to, this would be the school to do it), but I do say that female gender expression shouldn't seem like that, it comes with an even higher standard to prove your worth. Bimbo feminism gives people a respite from the pressing need for professional perfection. Take ""explaining things to girls,"" for example, a trend that is heavily criticized for infantilizing women, implying that they are not capable of understanding high-level professional language. But no one is able to do that immediately. The use of simple metaphors is an invaluable tool in education along with mnemonic devices and flowcharts. We compare the kinetics of a chemical reaction to a food assembly line and compare biological enzymes to staplers. We also use stereotypically masculine metaphors. I hear football metaphors left and right. So what's wrong with using stereotypically feminine metaphors toward a stereotypically feminine audience? Why do we suddenly reject different methods of education when they are aimed at women? In linguistics, one of the fundamental ideas is that no language, dialect or even slang is superior to another; no language indicates greater intelligence than another. Historically, people who use languages ​​such as creole dialects, African American vernacular English, or regional accents (especially those who come from the working class) are taken less seriously than those who speak ""standard"" English. I maintain that the valley girl accent (and the image of the hyper feminine woman as a whole) is no different. If we understand a concept, why does it matter what metaphor you used to get there? Why does the language in which you express it matter? Without realizing it, many of us have an instinctive dislike towards the hyperfeminine because they are the stereotypes we spend so much time fighting in the academic space. To quote psychologist Carl Jung, we hate in others what we hate (and have tried to bury) in ourselves. The rhetoric that those who speak “standard” English are smarter than others has been used for centuries to dismiss women and people of color and deny them higher education and positions of power. By listening to that knee-jerk reaction and automatically rejecting the image of the valley girl lecturing upper division economics, we are doing the same thing. We are expelling people who learn from simpler feminine metaphors (metaphors directed at women) from a space from which they have already been historically excluded. This learning method tells girls of average intelligence that they are capable of understanding difficult topics. Simplicity is not the enemy of academia. Obviously, there is a line here. We shouldn't explain centuries-long geopolitical wars and oppression with a fancy metaphor sandwiched between two sponsored Temu ads. Using metaphors, of any kind, runs the risk of losing nuance and downplaying the topic. There is a time and a place. But when I'm sitting with my friends in a library study room at midnight trying to understand inductive electron extraction using a frat party metaphor, I feel liberated. I am no longer burdened by jargon or the need for an air of professionalism. It's just me, a friend, and too many chemical mechanisms to memorize before Monday. So yes, female math is differential geometry, and yes, women can understand the lingo, and yes, women are really smart. But women aren't going to be perfect at everything, and they shouldn't be. There is a general desire here: wanting to return to blissful innocence and ignorance. Flirty fashion, bows, Sanrio characters, the list goes on. The collective turned to bimbo feminism for a reason, not just pinks and designer bags. From childhood, girls are pushed into highly responsible roles because they ""mature faster"" than boys. If ""boys will be boys"" from ages 3 to 30, why can't I be a girl for a while longer? Bimbo feminism shouldn't be the end of someone's feminism, but perhaps an addendum. A little voice to yourself that yes, I just embarrassed myself by spending $200 to change the oil at the mechanic and everyone thinks I'm stupid, but honestly? Iconic. Elle Woods and Barbie show us that we can be feminine and as smart as any man, but Karen Smith and bimbo feminism tell us that we can be feminine and stupid and still be loved. There is (and should be) a place in feminism for women to be mediocre. Elizabeth Lee thinks we should all ask stupid questions in class.

la-vista,"800 miembros de la comunidad se sumergen en el océano, récord mundial no superado","800 community members dive into the ocean, a world record not surpassed","More than 800 community members ran into the ocean at Devereux Beach on April 21 in an attempt to break the world record for a community “plunge” with the UC Santa Barbara student-run organization, The Plunge. In celebration of Earth Day, the event aimed to promote marine life conservation and sustainability by building community and raising funds for the Marine Conservation Network. The Isla Vista Plunge came within a couple thousand people of breaking the record. SHIUAN CHENG / EL NEXO DIARIO To break the record, the plunge required more than 3,500 participants, a record currently held by the Virginia Beach Polar Plunge since 2019. The Isla Vista Plunge was a couple of thousand people away from breaking the record. Although Sunday's plunge drew a large crowd, the organization hosts smaller plunges every Sunday at Devereux Beach. It was the first time they had organized a plunge on this scale and now they want to make it an annual tradition, according to Lior Kishinevsky, a third-year psychology and brain sciences student and member of the organization. Although they failed to break the record, Kishinevsky said the purpose of the plunge was to foster community and environmental change. “I wanted to plan an event for our community that would bring us together and do something good for the planet,” Kishinevsky said. Part of the event's intention was to promote the Marine Conservation Network (MCN), an environmental organization dedicated to finding science-based solutions to preserve marine life. Participation in the plunge was free and donations to MCN were encouraged. MCN members were on site with information tables and educated attendees about trash pollution in the oceans. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 14 million tons of plastic are collected in the ocean each year, and that damage doesn't include the amount of oil waste. ""The ocean is our life support. It's our air, our water, our medicine, our food, and if we don't protect it, it won't be there in the future,"" said Kimberly Ray, founder and CEO of MCN. Before the plunge, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department gave a safety announcement about the dangers of cliff erosion. The warning was further emphasized after the death of Jacob Parker the day before. Although the Plunge was scheduled for 11 a.m., participants did not enter the water until around 12 p.m. After a motivational talk from Kishinevsky, the 800 attendees descended the single staircase to the beach and dove into the ocean in unison.

la-vista,Supervisor del distrito del condado discute la seguridad de los acantilados y la vivienda en Isla Vista,County district supervisor discusses cliff safety and housing in Isla Vista,"Santa Barbara County Second District Supervisor Laura Capps hosted an informal coffee hour at the Isla Vista Community Center on April 19 to meet with local stakeholders and address their concerns. Attendees primarily discussed housing and safety issues in Isla Vista, as well as throughout the district. Supervisor Capps spoke to the Isla Vista community about safety concerns during an informal coffee chat. SIAVASH GHADIRI / EL NEXO DIARIO This coffee chat follows Capps' months-long effort on the eight-step cliff safety plan, which was approved during the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors (SBC) meeting. on November 7th. The plan includes developments in fence heights, lighting, horticulture and other cliff enforcement measures. Capps discussed the high cost and low quality of housing in I.V. as a main point of conversation. Both Capps and sheriff's deputies spoke about their experiences visiting at-risk properties along Del Playa Drive. Capps mentioned that a property on Del Playa Drive earns its owner $22,000 a month in rent from 19 students, even though the cliff-side balcony has partially collapsed. One deputy recounted an incident he had personally worked on, where a homeowner had been slow to respond to student complaints about a pipe leak. Capps responded that she and her team are looking into implementing a more proactive safety inspection process. He later reiterated officials' concern for the health and well-being of students. ""I've heard a lot about what I see as clear pricing abuse of students in Isla Vista, and that's concerning,"" Capps said. ""It contributes to this whole safety problem at I.V. [Students] live in unhealthy environments and pay astronomical fees."" Capps added that county officials lack the power to enforce housing-related safety ordinances, saying they cannot force homeowners to renovate their properties. Instead, Capps and his team have been talking to homeowners individually to encourage them to comply with the ordinances by offering county funds to help cover the cost of installing new fencing, lighting and other safety accommodations. Capps spoke about his prioritization of broader housing issues, emphasizing that his office has also been trying to stop illegal evictions. Evictions often occur because landlords close their properties for maintenance, which in many cases is “cosmetic,” according to Capps. Additionally, he discussed the state-mandated Housing Element plan, which will add approximately 6,000 new housing units in the county over the next eight years. Approximately 4,000 of these units will be concentrated in the Eastern Goleta Valley, the area east of the campus and downtown Goleta and west of downtown Santa Barbara. Capps criticized the decision to concentrate so much housing in one location, but stressed that he favors adding new housing throughout the county. ""I actually voted against it because of the concentration in a small area,"" Capps said. ""I'm in favor of new housing, just a little more spread out.""

la-vista,¿Sabí­as que?: La Independencia de Puebla,Did you know?: The Independence of Puebla,"Have you looked at your calendars? We have already reached the month of May. In addition to the fact that Mother's Day is celebrated this month, there is another important day: Cinco de Mayo. It is a day of celebration in Mexico, but it is also celebrated in the United States. The vast majority consider this day as Mexico's independence day but in reality that day is September 16. Cinco de Mayo is important for Mexicans because although it is a triumph of independence, it is not for the nation of the country. This refers to the Battle of Puebla which occurred in the city of Puebla, located in Veracruz, Mexico. After seventeen years of independence from Spain, the French invaded the city of Puebla. It was not until 35 years and three wars later that General Ignacio Zaragoza led the Battle of Puebla. The date of May 5 represents when the revolutionaries finally won the fight against the French and the great part of Mexico was freed from the control of other countries. In the United States, Cinco de Mayo is associated with the celebration of Mexican-American culture. In the 1960s, Chicano activists raised awareness about the fiesta, in part because they identified with the victory of indigenous Mexicans in the city of Puebla. Although the popularity of this celebration was also increased by the sales of alcoholic beverages and Mexican food in the United States. Cinco de Mayo is certainly a celebration, but it is more important to know exactly what is being celebrated and not make generalizations.

la-vista,"Estudiante es revocado su tarjeta de Latino después de declarar Tapatí­o ""demasiado picante""",Student has Latino card revoked after declaring Tapatío “too spicy”,"It was a sunny day in Isla Vista when one of our private investigators on the scene in Zócalo overheard a diverse group of students having a spontaneous lunch. Amid the lively noise of the kitchen and chatter at the acclaimed restaurant, fourth-year sociology student Fideo Pescadero who was overheard making a comment about the variety of hot sauce available. EL MARIACHI / EL NEXO DIARIO ""Dude, don't put that shit in my dish, it's too spicy,"" Pescadero said when his partner Mariana Del Sur offered to put a few drops of sauce on his order of chilaquiles. Complete silence filled the room, people gasped and the sounds of the kitchen staff walking towards the blasphemous statement were heard with increasing speed. After a few minutes of painful silence, our investigators took it upon themselves to further investigate this according to their journalistic integrity and get to the root of this enigma. ""Where did you say you're from?"" they asked Pescadero. ""Bakersfield,"" Pescadero answered. “Boy, what's your ethnicity?” they prompted. ""Mexican,"" Pescadero said. Disgruntled sounds were heard from Zócalo customers. ""I mean, the kid is not Latino, I mean, who says that Tapatío is spicy? Really stupid stuff,"" local gossip Guillermina Del Mar said in a private interview. ""I just think there are certain requirements to calling yourself a Latinx, you know? Like swearing in every other sentence, gesticulating like hell, and eating spicy food while making fun of gringos who say guacamole is spicy, I say?"" Embarrassed, Pescadero He tried to defend his position by stating allergies, issues with his appendix and that his mother is half gabacha, ""that's why I'm not used to spicy food, because I never cook with spicy ingredients,"" he said. Pescadero turned red with embarrassment, but not because he was enchilado. The Zócalo staff looked at each other confusedly and rejected the comment as they have never experienced such an occurrence and therefore did not know how to properly handle the situation. Reinforcements were called in and this year's CLG president decided to revoke his Latino card and consequently prohibited him from being present at the CLG ceremony this year. A deep sigh of relief was heard across the room and Pescadero was escorted out by the local Isla Vista foot patrol. ""If I had known this would happen I would have suggested lunch at Hummus Republic,"" Pescadero said in a closing comment as he walked into the depths of Isla Vista to reflect on his heritage and his life's prospects. Mariachi should eat roasted jalapenos on this.
