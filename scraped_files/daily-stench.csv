She was too busy posting selfies from coliseums to see the hundreds of zesty fire memes from her peers. Sanders returned to the U.S. feeling enlightened and refreshed, but she would soon pay for her insolence. On January 9, 2018, Sanders walked into Buchanan 1920, expecting to be welcomed to History 177: California History. She was surprised to find the lecture hall packed even though she arrived 15 minutes early. I remember a student next to me asked if I was nervous,ù Sanders recalled. I asked them if they thought it was going to be that difficult; I guess I should have clarified.ù  The TAs then handed out the exams, and the professor wrote the time remaining on the board. Still, Sanders remained clueless. I thought they were the syllabi, and maybe the professor just knew how much we all wanted to leave.ù It wasn't until she began flipping through the exam that she started to suspect that something was wrong. The test included essays about required readings and a multiple-choice section on Homer's The Odyssey. † That's when I got up and ran. I've seen The Simpsons, so I know Homer is from Illinois and not California.ù  Sanders hopes that by sharing her story, she will save others from enduring the same fate. † Emily Anne Williams is a third-year linguistics major that checks her umail religiously.

They've been preparing, mostly, for the rigorous task of jumping through hoops in order to display their athletic prowess and drive to succeed in a cutthroat major. This is now the second consecutive year that this has taken place. ESS Director, Jim N√§s√¶m, says that since the new test was implemented, the major has been even more popular than before. I tell you whatù N√§s√¶m said, They all said I was crazy when I first introduced this new policy, but I just gave it to òem straight: at this school we like to challenge our students, whether it be in classes or having to wait 3 hours to get a bus pass, we want students who can overcome any obstacle. And if students have to metaphorically jump through hoops to get into their major, then why can't they also do it physically?ù While many complain about certain complications surrounding this task, others embrace it with open arms. Freshman student, Allison Chains, is eager to hop on the bandwagon, believing that this new system will be great to weed out those who lack the heart and/or dedication. Everyone who would sit at home and watch Ninja Warrior and was like òI could totally do that' it's time for you to square-up and put your money where your mouth is. I'll see you there, chumps!ù Chains declared proudly. N√§s√¶m hopes that many of the other departments will follow his example and start challenging their students more. Inspired by N√§s√¶m's bold strategy, Professors in the Department of Art are no longer allowing students to submit any works valued below 1,000 words. Anything below 999 won't be accepted and will be counted as zeroes.

daily-stench,Sad! Thousands of New Year's Resolutions Left Abandoned on Streets of DP,23-Jan-18,4:20 AM,['Emma Demorest'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-23/sad-thousands-of-new-years-resolutions-left-abandoned-on-streets-of-dp/,"Alex Gonzalez / Daily Nexus Students and community members of Isla Vista this week are having trouble biking, driving and walking through the streets, where thousands of abandoned new year's resolutions have accumulated. The streets are littered with crumpled piles yesteryear, their contents torn to shreds and pushed into gutters alongside smashed cans of Bud Light. Sadly, this is an annual occurrence. UC Santa Barbara students, eager to change themselves for the better in light of a new year, hoard dozens of resolutions on January first. These resolutions are seemingly insurmountable for many IV residents, seeing as they cannot take care of or account for them even two weeks later, and lead to massive resolution abandonment come late January. The discarded resolutions have become such a problem this month that Isla Vista community officials are considering setting up strict resolution abandonment regulations in an effort beautify the community. Not uncommon for the first week back at school, it is easy to see the same resolutions hit the curb every year. Sorority Sally's spend less money on Starbucks frapsù is a classic, and this year was found laying torn and a little soggy in front of apartment complex dumpsters, as well as an upwards of two hundred unfulfilled go to the gymù resolutions, seen in tattered heaps on the curb of dog shit park.

Yang announced that he was stepping down as Chancellor of UCSB and immediately named his successor. In a brief and unexpected statement, Ex-Chancellor Yang said, I'm done. I've worked tirelessly my entire career and all these idiot students do is make memes out of me.ù He refused to offer further information on his stepping down, but he did take the time to disclose the identity of his successor.  The next Chancellor of UCSB is to be A Large Pile of Money that has a pair of glasses on top of it. Yang did not have any more information to offer, but representatives of Chancellor Large Pile of Money released a statement saying, Chancellor Large Pile of Money is exactly what this school needs and will surely take advantage of.ù When inquiring about his past, representatives insisted he was qualified, but vehemently denied rumors that he was made from students' tuition dollars. A deeper investigation into his past is to follow. Chancellor Large Pile of Money has yet to make a personal statement or address the public, presumably because he is not sentient since he is a large pile of money. His glasses are prescription. It is also reported that each department has already taken to him remarkably well, with different deans all groveling at the door of his new office.  Upon writing this article, the Daily Nexus has received exclusive information that Chancellor Large Pile of Money was just seen by students being wheeled around in a red wagon during what looked like a tour of the new engineering building. One student who asked to remain anonymous said, I already heard them asking Chancellor Large Pile of Money about building another engineering building.ù When we asked the College of Letters and Science about this incident, they simply responded, Those fuckers.ù According to his representatives, Chancellor Large Pile of Money has a Ph.D from every Ivy League institution in this country, as well as a pair of polarized Ray-Ban aviator glasses for when he gets taken to the beach. Updates to follow on his transition and how he will represent this institution with the honor and respect it deserves.  † Ariana Marmolejo is a Daily Nexus staff writer and a huge supporter of Chancellor Large Pile of Money.

daily-stench,UCSB Accepts Record Number of Out-of-State Students to Pay for New Science Building,29-Jan-18,8:42 AM,['Mia Roncati'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-29/ucsb-accepts-record-number-of-out-of-state-students-to-pay-for-new-science-building/,"Jenny Luo / Daily Nexus A recent investigation into the UC Santa Barbara Admission Committee has revealed a drastic increase of out-of-state students that were not documented in the annual report of acceptance rates. Anna Barbers, a representative from the UC Board of Regents, found that over 5,000 students were found to have been marked as in-state admissions over 3 years. On average, an in-state UCSB student pays $15,000 a year for tuition, while an out-of-state student pays around $45,000. Barbers discovered that this extra $150,000,000 has been funneled to finish a bigger, fancier science building that is currently being built behind the Davidson Library. It's sick,ù Barbers reported, We all know that S.T.E.M. majors make more money than liberal arts majors by a large amount, but that doesn't mean the out-of-state students should fund this disadvantage.ù  Barbers equated the out-of-state and international students with cash cowsù that the school is milking for all they can. There are rumors that Chancellor Yang is behind this mistreatment to keep the science Nobel Prize winners satisfied and to continue to be invited to their annual ball.  This is not the first time the UC Admission Committee has been under fire in the past few years. The year that the Davidson Library was finished also shows a spike in out-of-state students admitted to the university, but still under the record of students admitted.  When questioned about the possibility of being admitted solely for her money, Florida native Amy Winters stated, It makes me feel like I wasn't admitted by my merits. I mean, I got a 2.7 in high school; I thought I had actually deserved my spot.ù Chancellor Yang has refused to make a statement on this issue. The building will continue construction, and rumors of regulations banning out-of-staters from entering have been discussed. † Mia Roncati is a third-year from New Jersey who once fought a UC Regent that was using her for her money.

President Hieu Le addressed the Senate at Wednesday night's meeting, detailing his plan for success. Daily Nexus / Kaitlyn Nguyen On Wednesday, Jan. 31, Associated Students (A.S.) President Hieu Le proposed a plan to complete an expansion project of A.S. and the University Center. The problem? Well, you see, he hasn't said much before about this project, probably due to the fact that the project would require a student fee increase that could reach as high as $300 a year starting in five years. For now, it would require a $20 increase per student per quarter. That's a 10 percent increase!  It is presumed that graduating senior Le didn't boast about this 48 million dollar project beforehand, probably due to the fact that he ran his campaign on a promise to lower student fees. To pull quotes directly from the A.S. website, Le's plan included what he dubbed, GauchoServe,ù where he promised, I will work to lower your fees.ù Additionally, he wanted to RECLAIM Higher Ed,ù where students would say, NO MORE!ù and Le would launch a campaign to, RECLAIM the cost of your education.ù Le also proclaimed, No more exclusive A.S.ù†Try not to lose sight of this last claim with this plan, though, because part of the UCen renovation would serve to revamp study spaces to house the 38 percent of A.S. who don't have an *officially assigned* office space.  While we really do love our A.S. President, we do think it's appropriate to poke fun at some good old-fashioned political fuck-ups every now and again. Sorry Hieu, it just comes with the territory! So here's what we propose: Currently, the A.S. President gets their tuition paid while in office, in addition to a $3,000 honorarium each quarter, so if President Le really wants to improve our campus without raising student fees, he can take some of our suggestions on where to donate some of that nice honorarium, too! 1. Buy $9,000 worth of duct tape to hold together the remaining humanities buildings Look, we know all the money here goes to Engineering and S.T.E.M. buildings. The least A.S. can do is hold together the scraps of the remaining humanities buildings to please the plebeians studying to make a social difference in society,ù get into governmentù and even to become teachers.ù I know î it's not like those jobs really make a difference in the world, but we at least have to support that part of our campus. 2. Replace all the forks in dining commons with platinum utensils Because why the hell not if you already have a $48 million budget for a resume builder? It's the more stylish way to transfer hepatitis from student to student. 3. Painting over that creepy fucking mural inside of Ortega It's horrifying and ruins students' appetites. If you really care about your community, you'll paint over it. It honestly probably wouldn't even cost that much. 4. Building a small train from I.V. to Chem 1179 Self explanatory. Life is rough sometimes. 5. Funding Campus United's ridiculous campaign budget You don't need your ridiculous marketing plans, aggressive tabling or even CU-chella, because realistically who else are people even going to vote for? You're basically the only party. You just don't need to spend that much money, but if you must, you might as well dip into that honorarium stash to do so! 6. Building a box fort outside of UCen for remaining 38 percent of A.S. There's your precious office space. It's not like anyone is going to go to your office hours anyways.

According to Todd Toddson, an unknown assailant stole his size 11 Sperry's while he was black-out drunk at a party. Isla Vista Foot Patrol investigated the matter and determined that the perpetrator is none other than Ricky Raccoon, an Isla Vista native.  IVFP was able to locate Mr. Raccoon after a post went viral on UCSB's Free and For Sale Facebook page. Initially, they were looking for a human perpetrator, but upon coming across a picture of the furry creature wobbling along the streets of DP in shoes too big for him, IVFP decided to take action. This isn't the first time a raccoon has done something like this. A number of shoe thefts have been attributed to the raccoon community, although we aren't certain as to why raccoons are committing these crimes,ù an IVFP spokesperson said in a statement earlier today.  Although elusive, Mr. Raccoon has been arrested and is being held at the Santa Barbara County Jail. His bond is set at $1 trillion. † It's what he deserves, you know? He can't just go around stealing people's shoes without their consent. It's just a really shitty thing to do,ù Toddson said.  Mr. Raccoon's trial is set for mid-February. Upon questioning by a very adamant Daily Nexus reporter, Mr. Raccoon said in response to his charges, aoeirjeowijlksfjadskjweoirucnsiow,ù which was translated by Mr. Raccoon's lawyer.  My client wishes to inform the press that he is not at all sorry for what he did and that frat boys òhave it coming to them',ù Mr. Raccoon's lawyer said. If we [the racoon community] aren't allowed to drop it like it's hot at parties, neither should frat boys.ù  If anyone affected by this shoe theft wants their belongings back, they need to visit their local dumpster. Any leftover shoes will be donated to the author of this article, who desperately needs a new pair.  † Christina Muoio is a staunch advocate for raccoon rights.

Martinez has gone so far as to cuff herself before anyone else gets the chance. She had participated fully in past cuffing seasons, though each landed her with guys she ended up hating. It is reported that in November of 2015, Martinez began dating a man named Daniel Santiago, who wouldn't let her see him without socks on. Later, in December of 2016, she met Aiden Short, who told her six weeks into dating that she would look hot with a bowl cutù thus subsequently ending their short relationship. This year, Martinez is ready. And, instead of waiting for impending doom of another weirdo would-be could-be partner to swoop her up, she has decided to preemptively cuff herself. It was a natural reaction, really,ù said Martinez upon changing her facebook relationship status and going so far as to literally cuff herself, just to stay on the safe side. Though the cuffs are a nuisance to wear while biking and doing all things throughout the day, Martinez reportedly feels safer knowing that the cold winter months won't cause her to swoon for anyone she'll regret later. † Emma Demorest is a writing and literature major who you shouldn't bother cuffing, please.

(Natural Understanding of Truelove).  With Valentine's Day around the corner, this might be an awkward time for you and the person you're kind of'' seeing. Like everyone in Isla Vista, they're probably scared of commitment ì but no worries! I'm here to help you convince them that they're not anymore.  And so, with the power vested in me, I now present to you this foolproof method to ensure exclusivity between you and your future Valentine. Yes, I know that this is the satirical section of the Nexus, but hear me out when I say that every time I've tried this method, it worked. Whether these aforementioned relationships actually lasted is none of your fucking business, but you get it!  THE SECRET  The secret to trapping a mans (or a womans) is to heavily exploit one's fear of contracting an STD.  After sex and during pillow talk, one must say something along the lines of, Hey, I need to know if you're seeing anybody else because we've been messing around lately and I'm not trying to get an STD. It's not like I'm in love with you or anything ì I'm just looking out for myself here.ù  Now, this gives you two options: † † 1. If they do say that they're seeing other people but what you really want is commitment, then the (wo)mans is canceled. That means you block them on everything until they miss you enough to show up on your doorstep in the rain with the means of getting you back.  † † 2. But if they say that they're not seeing anyone else, then congratulations! You two are basically married according to Isla Vista's relationship standards.  Do you see how genius this is? It's not too needy but it's also not too detached. It's a smart and effective way to instantly know your relationship status based on legitimate health concerns. Now, get out there and shoot your shot. After all, òYou miss 100% of the shots you don't take î Wayne Gretzky' î Michael Scott. † Diana Prince hopes that you bust that N.U.T. this V-Day season! Good luck!

I guess he wanted to spend time with me really badly because he didn't shower or anything before. Like, he literally just raced over. When he got to my dorm, he pulled up YouTube and put on an hour long New Year's Eve trap music playlist, because nothing gets me wet like a beat. Almost immediately, he was fully erect. His enthusiasm is just always making me feel confident and secure like that. He gets me and that's one of the things I love about him. He was nodding his head to the beat of the YouTube playlist, as I was giving him a handjob, synchronizing his movements to the beat of the music. I think he had been saving up for me, because he shot his fireworks (just like the fireworks that were in the background of the YouTube display) within a minute of me giving him a handjob. It was so nice that he came before sex so he could last longer for me and satisfy my needs. He treats me right.  Things heated up pretty quickly after and we did missionary for three minutes. His face was on my neck the entire time. Not kissing it î just breathing hot, heavy, and moist air onto it. It made me feel so close to him. Even though his thrusting was really fast paced, his upper body was limp, almost like he wanted me to support him. We were a team, both emotionally and physically. The blaring trap music, his constant breath, and his fast pumping all came together in a beautiful trio of rhythms, like the work of some famous jazz musician like Neil Armstrong. There were no words or other noises. We didn't need that. Getting lost in the music and our bodies is all I wanted on the hottest, most romantic holiday of the year. After three minutes, he came, pulled out, and muttered fuck under his breath. He then took my monochromed S'well bottle off my desk and poured water into the condom until the water/cum mixture overflowed, spilling onto my floor. This just î I'm not even exactly sure how to describe it î like, made me hornier than I had ever been in my entire life. Just the thought of his cum all up in the fibers of my carpet forever is potentially the best Valentine's Day present I could have ever asked for.  After filling the condom, he asked me for the first time if I was on birth control. This just reinforced why I am with him. He supports me and cares for me. He also asked me if I wanted to hit the PHIX, because JUULing is for pussies, and my man is far from that. † Kortni†Kond”¶m is a fun-loving junior that cites Nicolas Sparks as the greatest author of all time.

The researchers reported that there has yet to be any physical injuries from such musicù outbreaks, yet emotional stress caused by bombastic noise is exponentially increasing.  Most vibrations in the Earth's †sediment can withstand intense resonance frequencies from earthquakes, yet dubstep music has been the first anthropogenic cause of cliff erosion. Albeit some quality music has been able to cancel out the sound coming from certain neighborhood dubstep marathons, the overwhelming force of nature is no match for such sounds. Aside from occasional obscenities thrown at the general area of the source, no action has been taken from either the school or Isla Vista community.  The study has also found that at this rate, Del Playa is at risk of losing not only the cliffside, but its reputation for having good taste in music for parties and kickbacks.ù Some houses have been forced to wear headphones simultaneously, decreasing the social skills of said households, and leading to blood boils that make behavior erratic. Some crowds have decided to avoid Del Playa altogether, as bleeding eardrums do not attract the opposite sex.ù The correlation between dubstep being played and fuckbois playing can be seen through charts and statistics, but the attempt to explain to said fuckbois that their taste is bad has failed. Additionally, the ratio of music to entire neighborhood in a radius of one mile wanting to hear said music is 300 to one î a staggering new find. The cliff erosion will not cease until the source of musicù is swallowed into the ocean, and even then, there is a chance that the same dubstep might return to the streets of Del Playa one day.  † Daniel Mauldin is a proficient music lover who excels at criticizing songs based on how much it sounds like transformers fucking.

You probably procrastinated and have some late nights ahead of you. So, if you are a dedicated student and hardcore Yerba supporter, consider these 10 alternative ways to get your Yerba fix. It's time to ditch your mainstream ways because no one likes a basic bitch. † 1. Tampon Plugging: Courtesy of Giphy When you're feeling like a slug, you know it's time to plug, so give that Yerba tampon a snug vaginal hug.  Tip: For those who do not have a vagina, do not feel left out. You can insert a Yerba-soaked tampon into your anus. 2. Butt Chugging: Courtesy of Tumblr What are you waiting for? Put that shit in a funnel to get it in your tunnel.  Tip: Use anal beads or butt plugs often, so the funnel slides in real nice. 3. Snorting: Courtesy of SlowRobot After taking too much up your rectum, look no further than your septum. Damage your nose, not your GPA! Tip: Use a laminated bill (waterproof) or a shortened redvine. 4. Shooting Up: Courtesy of Shutterstock If you're looking to reboot, take the fast route and just shoot that hoot.  Tip: To all you premed students, help your friends shoot up. It's a great way to practice placing an IV in patients. 5. Gummy Bears: Courtesy of The Barchitects If you swear that you can no longer stare at your computer and you're feeling in despair, then soak some gummy bears in Yerba and pop them if you dare.  Tip: Soak gummy bears in Yerba until they reach approximately the size of Chad and Brad's dick. 6. Eyeballing: Courtesy of All About Eyes Midterms shouldn't make you cry, so dry your tears and drop some Yerba in your eyes î I promise, you'll fly as high as the sky.  Tip: Use a child eyedropper for exceptional precision. If you cannot find one, pop over to the chem building and borrow a dropper. 7. Vapor: Courtesy of MakeAGIF Put down the rolling paper. Instead, inhale the Yerba vapor. Tip: If you don't have dry ice on hand to pour the Yerba over, you can #DIY and use your bike pump. 8. Shotgunning: Courtesy of Claire Horsley Your studying might not be done, but you can still have some fun and stun everyone in the library while you show off how you shotgun.  Tip: If you're a real pro, you'll ditch the keys and wolf bite instead. 9. Rub a Dub Tub: Courtesy of Pizza Biscuit If you shotgun, you may choke. So, if you feel like you're gonna croak, sit in a tub of Yerba and just let it soak.  Tip: Be sure to bleach your tub beforehand. You don't want the remnants from IV nights to mix with your Yerba. 10. Sipping: Courtesy of E! Online If you don't feel like caffeine tripping, you're a pussy and you should focus on your sipping.  Tip: If this is how you choose to ingest your Yerba, reevaluate your life. You're probably dull and universally forgotten.

daily-stench,The People vs. Freebirds: American Crime Story,26-Feb-18,4:20 AM,['Lukas Abetie'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-26/the-people-vs-freebirds-american-crime-story/,"Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus A staple of the student body's diet is the food of Chipotle knock-off, Freebirds. The establishment hosts a variety of pseudo-Mexican foods like burritos, tacos and quesadillas. As one could guess based on the restaurant's popularity, many find the food delicious î irresistible even. So irresistible that many wish to patronize Freebirds late at night in an inebriated state. Therein lies the hard-hitting story of how Freebirds, a pillar of Isla Vista eateries, began overcharging students too drunk to notice.  This indelible infraction is one step too far. When I finally decided that enough was enough, I went around campus to uncover the truth and see what students think about the scandal I hoped to create. The consensus was immediate: Everyone knew that Freebirds overcharged drunk students. At this point it had become part of school lore, an unwritten right of passage for new students. One student we talked to claimed to have multiple receipts that prove she was overcharged multiple times when she went drunk. However, she, along with the others affected, said they are fine with it. It seems that students on campus not only know about Freebirds' overcharging, but also are content with inaction.  I wasn't, however, so in a bold step for my investigation I sent a fellow reporter undercover to Freebirds drunk to see if he would be overcharged. This portion of the investigation started with him drinking a few beers, but quickly spiraled out of control and lead to him drinking Bailey's out of a shoe. With my subject drunk, the task of getting to Freebirds commenced. I wasn't quite sure that my friend î I mean subject î was drunk enough, but my doubts quickly vanished when during the walk to the dining establishment he almost fought a bum in an alley that smelled like industrial grade laundry detergent. To save the integrity of the investigation and my subject's face, I was able to pull him away and get him to Freebirds safely. Outside, I instructed him to make the only right choice and get the nachos with chicken. From the window I watched as he hobbled in and ordered his food.  Predictably, he messed up and instead got a veggie burrito bowl like some sort of communist, but the food was not the goal of the mission î the receipt was. I looked at it to see that contrary to popular belief he was charged the correct amount. It seems that in this instance a drunk patron was not overcharged. That being said, the amount of people who say they have is too big to ignore. While this article has ended, my investigation to uncover the truth hasn't. I will not stop until Freebirds no longer overcharges students just because they are tossed as fuck. † Lukas Abetie moonlights as both a detective and a Freebired quality assurance analyst.
Print FREEBIRDS was founded in 1987. Chipotle wasn't founded until 1993. Freebirds isn't a Chipotle knock off. They honestly had the best Mexican food in IV and that's coming from a Chicano from LA but super cucas does have the best breakfast burritos. I seriously doubt freebirds would overcharge drunk patrons because It is bad business sense.  Freebirds would value repeat business over the extra 5$ max they could gain in one transaction.  The only way I could see this happening is if the patron payed cash, and was given the incorrect change by the cashier who pocketed the difference.

The Michelin Star restaurateur, who is aiming to feature UCSB on the next season of Kitchen Nightmares, shed some light on what exactly he thinks about dining hall cuisine.  Ramsey's first stop was Ortega, where he had a hearty breakfast of oatmeal, homemade granola and freshly cut fruit. After spitting out the oatmeal, he said, I don't know who Ortega is, but he owes me an apology for the abomination he calls food! Do yourself a favor and don't eat here.ù  After taking a delightful swim at Campus Point Beach, Ramsay visited Carrillo for lunch, where he enjoyed a slice of pizza and some pasta. Throwing the pizza to the ground, he said, I didn't know it was possible to have food that tastes worse than literal shit. Actually, that's an insult to shit. My apologies.ù  After yelling at Carillo's head chef for 10 minutes, Ramsay visited the supposed bestù dining hall on campus: De La Guerra. His dinner consisted of fajitas and a side of salad. As he wipes his tears away with a piece of lettuce, Ramsay was heard saying, DLG should change its name to DGT: Don't go there. I can't believe I wasted years of my life pursuing a culinary career only for this atrocity to be served to me.ù  For some off-campus fun, Ramsay went to Portola, famed by the freshman for being the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth.ù After tasting a slice of apple pie, Ramsay threw the plate to the ground and screamed, You serve this to first-years!? This should be a constitutional violation under the òcruel and unusual punishment' tab. Change your name to òPortoilet' and get out of my face.ù  The FT dorms even opened up the Old Portola for Ramsay as a one-time-only treat.How the fuck do you mess up fish tacos? The ocean is right there. No wonder you closed down! Whoever the hell decided to reopen this monstrosity of an establishment deserves to be fired 10 times over.ù  Overall, Mr. Ramsay enjoyed his experience at UCSB's dining commons, saying that, This food is more than a nightmare. I pray for those poor students who have to eat here. I wouldn't even feed this shit to my dog.ù † Nicole Slaw is a third-year culinary arts major who wants Gordon Ramsay to roast her on Twitter.

In her post, she she states, I'm so sick of how inconsiderate people in Isla Vista are by blocking her car in, and if they don't move it by 3 p.m., I'll tow.ù  Sources on the ground who are familiar with the situation say that by 3:30 pm the alleged blocking car was still in its spot and no tow truck had been called. The car left around 4 p.m., and everyone involved seems to have moved on î at least until this happens again, at which point the cycle will repeat. The rise of off-topic posting in the UCSB Free & For Sale page has local residents worried and confused. We reached out to handsome local resident Maurice Hiccups who stated, How am I supposed to buy concert tickets that I can't afford when I have to scroll through paragraph after paragraph of people complaining about random shit?ù  Hiccups later goes on to say that he has seen it all. From individuals complaining about people sneezing in class to people seeking out dates, Hiccups believes that the state of affairs is gradually getting worse. Facebook engineers believe the issue lies within the site's software. What happens is people make posts that should be going up on their personal profile, and somehow the algorithm makes it end up on this Free & For Sale page,ù says leading engineer Tom McMahon. Facebook is hard at work on the issue, and they hope to have a fix implemented by the time date party season rolls around to combat the traditional influx of seeking dateù posts. For people like Megan Masterson, this new fix spells the beginning of the end. When reporters reached out for comment she stated, How else am I supposed to force people to listen to me!? I only have 300 Facebook friends, and ranting on Free & For Sale is the only way to make sure people have to look at my bad opinions.ù  † Maurice Hiccups has eggs in his brains.

daily-stench,New Snapchat Update Now Leading Cause of Divorce,2-Mar-18,4:20 AM,['Mia Roncati'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-02/new-snapchat-update-now-leading-cause-of-divorce/,"Courtesy of Know Your Mobile The new Snapchat update has been hitting home for a lot of its users î literally. In the past week, Apple has hacked into everyone's phone and forced the update, whether you asked for it or not. Tensions already have been running high as people have been wondering if they are going to be next; each time the app is opened is a 50/50 chance for your life.  Not only is the update confusing millennials with its clustered appearance and aggressive discovery page, but it is also causing strife amongst its users. Recent studies in the Psychology Department at UCSB have previously conducted research before the update that shows that Snapchat streaks determine a happy marriage. In fact, having a 200-day or more streak absolutely guarantees a zero chance of divorce. However, with the confusing layout, users have been giving up on their streaks with their significant other to communicate with easier methods, like e-mail or carrier pigeon. This loss of a streak is causing tension between typically happily married couples. Divorce rate in the state of California has almost doubled in only one week. The loss is even being felt on the outskirts of the Isla Vista community. Maria Snappieù Parker, a stay-at-home mom in Goleta, is reported to have had the most ongoing streaks with her Snapchat friends in 2017. She is now filing for a divorce from her husband after he stopped Snapchatting and made her lose her title. It's like he doesn't even want to try with our marriage anymore,ù she wrote in a Snapchat message to her lawyer. I don't want to spend the rest of my life with a man who refuses to enjoy my puppy-dog face because of an update.ù If you or a loved one have been affected by this Snapchat update, please call C.A.P.S. advisors to schedule an appointment for couple's therapy. † Mia Roncati is a third-year who once lost an 800-day Snapstreak and cried for a week.

daily-stench,BREAKING NEWS: MEN AIN'T SHIT,6-Mar-18,10:27 AM,['Mia Roncati'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-06/breaking-news-men-aint-shit/,"Jose Ochoa / Daily Nexus This Sunday morning, after a night of over-sexualization sprinkled with a hint a misogyny, the lovely ladies of Isla Vista have come to a startling conclusion, unheard of even in the scientific world: men, yes ALL men, ain't shit.  A proclamation was written by three women; within two hours, the group meeting had almost 500 attendees, most of them stumbling in accidentally after their walks of shame. The proclamation outlines the women's grievances with not only men of Isla Vista, but of the entire world. They argue that women have been plagued by men who treat them like FreeBirdsù girls, when they are actually Los Agavesù girls. They call for a dismantling of all frat houses, the burning of the Rec Cen and a collective agreement never to give their phone numbers to anyone named Brad, Jonathan and especially not to any who goes by their last name.  One of the leaders of the campaign, Britanni (with an I,ù not a Yù), discusses how their conclusions differ from the man-hating feminists of the 1970s: The hairy ladies of the 1970s were, like, lame, angry lesbians, when we're, like, hot girls who also have great personalities, so people will def listen to what we say.ù The men of Isla Vista have barely noticed that the girls are rallying against them. When asked for a comment on the situation, Brad Bradsmith said, Britanni? The girl who could possibly be a 10 with some makeup? Eh, she's probably just a clingy broad and angry that she wasn't the best I had in bed.ù Bradsmith was then high-fived by the group of other menù around him. The others were also as completely oblivious to the cause as Bradsmith.  The women of this feminist agenda will be holding a service for their lost virginities and wasted time on Monday at Embarcadero Hall. † Mia Roncati is mostly certainly not bitter, but she is salty that you would suggest such a thing. †

daily-stench,Little Known UCSB Campus Facts You Need Should Totally Know!,8-Mar-18,4:20 AM,['Brock Clark'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/little-known-ucsb-campus-facts-you-need-should-totally-know/,"UCSB is home to many great sites, but not too many people know the facts behind them. I don't know, I just like the way they look,ù answered Chad Morson when asked what some his favorite parts about the famous UCSB landmarks were. Well, Chad, the buildings in fact have stories and not just good personalities,ù so let's dive in. † 1) Storke Tower Will Tran / Daily Nexus Storke Tower was named after the famous dietitian Richard Storke, who operated the famous celeb dietary boutique, Glam Bods, in Santa Barbara in the early 1930s. Later in life, Storke decided to dip on his dietitian roots and go into fertility studies. After Storke revolutionized the medical field with his invention of the male birth control shot in 1945 (thanks to the aid of captured Nazi war criminals), the University of California system knew that an absurdly monolithic and phallic clock tower was the right thing to immortalize his name. † 2) The Central Bike Loop Olivia Consterdine / Daily Nexus The Central Bike Loop was built by the last remaining members of the founding monks of the Santa Barbara Mission. These monks were not only trained in the ancient ways of Freudian Catholicism but also had a shit-ton of Bob the Builderù VHSs and asphalt. The monks just sort of showed up one day and told some students to get bikes or piss off.ù They also made it explicitly clear that the loop should in no way then or in the future be used for those goddamn boards people skate around on. What are those called Brother Ted?ù Brother Ted replied, Skateboards, you degenerate.ù After completion of the Loop, the monks folded out their lawn chairs on the surrounding grass, hiked up their robes, knocked back some ice teas and watched the idiots who didn't know how to properly step up or yield crash into each other. † 3) Davidson Library Irene Chen / Daily Nexus This goliath was built in honor of the first charter class of UCSB. The students of this day and age did not have much time for partying because they were here in the last four years of the Prohibition, so they decided to make UCSB stand out with education instead. When asked if the current library lives up to the example set by the class that inspired it, one librarian had this to say: I definitely don't think so. There's never any quiet time in here. Last week a bird got in here and dive-bombed a minor's eye, and some teacher from the film department rents out one room and just lets kids watch porn for research.ù When looking into the most troubling of the above claims, the Daily Nexus's own Ryan Watt was able to identify the pesky bird as an Island Scrub Jay. Watch out for that little bastard near the nonfiction section on turpentine poisoning and other carpentry-related accidents.  † 4) †Embarcadero Hall Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus What can we say about Embarcadero Hall that hasn't been said by any other student? It's conveniently located directly across from Woodstock's Pizza, it's got extremely limited bike parking and it's definitely a trek for anyone trying to make it there in the ten minutes they have after section because it's not even on campus. I don't know much more about this place. It's sort of like the Upside Down in the extremely underrated and over-promoted television show Stranger Thingsù; all of your friends have been to it and mention it on a regular basis, but you're just sitting here being Nancy's mom waiting for some hot piece of underaged ass to sweep you off your feet while your son is cave-deep in that hellhole. If you have a friend named Barb, don't let her take a class here.  † 5) The Ucen Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus The Ucen is the hub of all activity for students on the UCSB campus. Need to get your third ID replacement after you dropped yours in some random party on DP? Head here. Want to check if your drive-by-dad sent you a check with an irate letter about your supposedly insubordinate behavior? Try the local post office, conveniently located next to a bunch of random offices. Feeling like you need some fresh school merch but don't want to pay for it? Drop by the Campus Store, where the motto is, If it fits in your pants or backpack, it's free!ù You can't miss this place because it obstructs the perfect view of the ocean the campus would have if some geniuses hadn't decided they needed to remind everyone they can steal the last bit of joy we all had after we poured our life savings into our tuition.  † 6) Humanities and Social Sciences Building Lianna Nakashima / Daily Nexus The Humanities and Social Sciences Building î or HSSB as the locals call it î is where all the local geniuses reside. In this building, people study Humanities and Social Sciences. What's so special about this building is the amount of research projects our students are doing together in the fields of Social Sciences and Humanities. Can't forget about those Humanities. If you were to drop by there some time, you could probably sit in on one of the famous lectures our faculty members deliver on subjects such as Social Science and Humanity. Also, this facility has the nicest bathrooms on campus.  † 7) Bus Loop Xinyang Miao / Daily Nexus The Bus Loop is the hub of transportation on the UCSB campus. Built in the mid-90s, the Bus Loop offers free and accommodating rides to students with a bus sticker on their valid student IDs. When on the bus, it is important to remember that offering someone a seat on your lap is just as î if not more î polite as offering them your seat. Additionally, it's really easy to make friends on the bus by putting your hand on someone else's hand when you're both standing and holding the rail. Lastly, the bus driver always loves it if someone stands in front of the yellow line, that way he or she can have a meaningful conversation with someone about his or her day. I almost forgot: People love it if you bring a bluetooth speaker and jam to some groovy tunes during the ride; Careless Whisperù by George Michael is always a favorite! † 8) The Arbor Harvest Keene / Daily Nexus The Arbor is the best place on campus to find friends and join new clubs. Our own little stretch of heaven observes 24 hours of total sunlight a week. This runway of student models has everything: a stand with soft pretzels, sororities and fraternities you've never heard of advertising long before and long after rush week and a guy who offers really good facts about UCSB for five cents that would probably feel job insecurity if he read this piece. A little-known fact about our beautiful Arbor is that it was designed by the architects of the courses on the super popular show, American Ninja Warrior,ù but instead of stationary obstacles to avoid, they just threw in a bunch of solicitors. The first time you make it through this place, you're going to feel like you just medaled in the Olympics for how to use your headphones for offense instead of recreation.  † 9) The Labyrinth Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus The Labyrinth is the place where students go to find peace on the UCSB campus. Melodic views, surreal breezes and lingering grasses effortlessly guide patrons on this igneous crested pathway reach the nirvana they've always felt the longing for in the secluded tombs of their beings. The revelations that will lay upon the souls of students while wading through this pasture of righteousness cannot be transcribed by the finite notions of contemporary understandings of science or religion. In addition, you get bonus points if you make it through this whole thing while you're blacked out from a night on DP. † † 10) The Recreation Center Nicole Wallace / Daily Nexus The Recreation Center î or Rec-Cen for literally everyone who uses it in a passing conversation î is the pinnacle of fitness and health on the UCSB campus. When you go to the Rec-Cent, immerse yourself in the weight rooms, yoga studios and 50 basketball courts. One of our main gymnasiums even has a rock wall, where it is totally cool with the staff if you just jump up and do the top ropes course without a partner or any gear necessary to belay you! Between the gyms is a lovely pool that is awesome for realizing you should probably take it easy on the Woodstock's Pizza, because let's face it, your face might not say Freshman 15, but your waist is hating you in those trunks right now. Next to our pool is an outdoor grass area which is terrific for rolling around and crying on after you've realized your finals wrecked any chance you had at making a decent future for yourself!

Your throat strains to swallow what little saliva is left in your mouth, as your cracked lips writhe and strain in the hot Santa Barbara sun over dry teeth that scrape against the inside of your mouth. You're thirsty, you're broke and you need some free water. Where do you go? Lucky for you, my dear reader, I have conducted a city-wide pool on the free water of I.V., and through my efforts, my suffering, my imbibing, I've created an extensive backlog of some of the best and worst places to get free water in Isla Vista.

Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of such a time, with the spout for water being located next to a suspiciously empty plastic container, perfect for holding plastic cups, but as of now this is all speculation. Evidence also suggests that Freebirds has no goddam idea as to what's refreshing, due to the placement of a Sparkling Waterù spout all too close to the good ol' water spout.

Cafe Equilibrium's water, what with its lemons or whatever those things are floating in an otherwise fine container of water, is the antithesis of my whole being. I've always been a man of boundaries. When I was little I ran away from girls because I was afraid of cooties. When I was in highschool I avoided people who said hellaù unironically.

Fourth-year political science and environmental studies double major Benjamin Lou expressed his excitement about graduating early with both a double major and still having time to go abroad. His roommates, however, did not share his same emotions. In fact, they didn't have any thoughts on it at all.

My friends are mostly bio majors and could only take a limited number of units without dying, which is why they're graduating just on time,ù she said. Both Lou and Jenkins were mostly surprised that their friends did not offer any opinions in general, neither expressing excitement or annoyance that their friends were able to accomplish this achievement ahead of them. Jenkins' and Lou's friends and roommates were asked to comment on these recent reports. Most of those questioned did not have a response, and those that did offered almost no opinion at all. I mean, it's just a quarter. It's not good or bad. Just what they did,ù said one of Jenkins' friends who graduates in spring.

You can't do anything at 19 or 20 that you couldn't do at 18, so really, what's the point in celebrating? Well, if you're anything like me and will celebrate your birthday for an entire month because you're extra af, then you'll find that this list covers ways to celebrate pretty damn well, if I do say so myself.  † 1. Answer birthday wishes from people you forgot you had on Facebook This remains one of my all time ways to celebrate my birthday. I love casually liking birthday messages from people I forgot existed and haven't talk to in years. It really feels like I'm giving back to my community.  † 2. Treat yourself I'm only going to be this young once! You bet your ass I'm going to go all out and spend money I don't have on things that will make me happy for two seconds. But hey, something has to fill the void, right?  † 3. Call your mom Every year, I call my mom and thank her for giving birth to me. Then I apologize for making her suffer for so many years. I'm not sure if she will ever forgive me, but it's the thought that counts! † 4. Don't do any school work  It's your day, dammit, and your professors and TAs should understand that! You're entitled to a stress free, work free day. And if they try to take points off or if they try to fail you, just pull the It's my birthdayù card. Not only will it work every time, but your professors and TAs will be so impressed with your level of self care and excitement, they'll high-five you and ask to go to your birthday party.  † 5. Have an existential crisis This is by far my favorite way to celebrate my birthday. Nothing makes me happier than the thought that I'm a year closer to death, I haven't accomplished anything, I'm never going to get a job, and I'm wasting my time at university instead of doing something else with my life and I'm never going to graduate, no one is ever going to love me and I'm most likely going to die alone.  † I hope these tips come in handy. Have a happy birthday!  † Christina Muoio is 19 and gets a hefty wash of existential dread every time she smells birthday cake.

When asked why he was so apt to continue sighing at Davidson, he simply shrugged and continued to scroll through Facebook. However, not all of the students found this behavior troublesome.

Once I saw one of the students without headphones close their book and walk away, I knew it was significant,ù she said. That night, Buffet would return back into her lab at Psych 2152 and use rodent models to examine the phenomenon. Stress was applied by fluctuating the volume of a Kidz Bop 20 recording. The results showed increase levels of yawning under minor amounts of stress. Ricardo Moreno / Daily Nexus According to Buffet, the rodents appeared more joyful for moments after the sighs, which would quickly level off, requiring another large exhale only seconds later, with the louder exhales producing longer periods of a joyful euphoria. I always feel better after I sigh, and this good feeling is only increased when I see the power I have to disturb other students.

When it comes to Yerba, though, that's a different story î it don't count, okay? 3. Thou shalt not wear underwear with yoga pants. Full. Commando. 4. Thou shalt not go to bed without reading a book. We all have that book-lover in our life that never understood the power of SparkNotes. 5. Thou shalt not go to bed without taking shots of water. Because dead week has us all feeling like we want to die and too weak to actually do anything about it. 6. Thou shalt not succumb to basic vocabulary. I discern, assuredly, my opulence with this one. 7. Thou shalt not watch more than two episodes of Hart of Dixieù at a time. Although personal dramas are enough to fuel most of us, it's nice to realize that there is a fake person out there with a made-up life and dramas that are ridiculous, but, finally, don't stem from our own crises. 8. Thou shalt not be in bed later than 11:30 p.m. We're just trying to be healthy adults with above average circadian rhythms for the college student demographic. 9. Thou shalt not fall asleep without sharing a token of knowledge. Because we all need more facts of the dayù (FOTD) in our lives. 10. Thou shalt not abstain from pre-marital sex ¶ even if he is a Libertine (cue appropriate use of commandment number 6) Live your life, have fun, be safe, my friends. Regardless, wasn't it more fun to finish this list off with this commandment than the mundane ones I listed earlier?! † Anat Katzir is confused about Mapaches.

Doesn't mean you can't get drunk and laid this spring break in your trusty òol childhood bedroom! But what about my parents? They're right down the hall! Fear not young one, your sex guru is back to tackle the ultimate c**k block. That's right. The advice you've all been waiting for: how to kick your parents out so you can bang your old high school fling. † 1. Send them a text that there's a sale at the local hardware store. Parents eat sales up! And of course the sexual innuendos will let them know they might have to really comb those aisles. (Get it? òCuz tools and wood) 2. Change all of the locks while they're sleeping. Wave at them while they bang on the front door with Christi or Lindsee or whatever other home-from-college broad that also just happened to totally randomly go to that absolute rager at Joey's house, who may or may not be in the high school class of '18.  3. Put a sock on your bedroom door. A classic!! Your dad is 100% going to fist bump you the next morning over your congrats you got laidù breakfast made by your mom. Because nothing says adult sex than chocolate chip pancakes with a whipped cream smiley face. 4. Obnoxiously make out with someone in front of them. A risky option, yes. But you're an adult now, damn it, and you can kiss whoever you want in your parent's kitchen! They are bound to get so grossed out that they book a hotel room for the night in the next town over.  5. Have sex on the living room couch. While this isn't necessarily sexiling since they will be upstairs, it is fool-proof and, personally, one of my favorites (and you can trust a good girlù named Candace). The loud action movie, the blanket over the lap and waiting till your parents fall asleep at 10:30: it'll bring back good memories of you absolutely having no idea how to please another person in high school  (See: Where is female genitalia? Should foreplay be longer than a minute?).  † Candace Dunkin once sexiled a house of 15 people and somehow convinced them it was their idea.

The weather app on your phone will reveal the disappointing fate you've feared since the El Ni√±o craze of 2015. This Saturday, on the most legendary day of the year, it might rain, but come drizzle or drought, you need to be ready. Make like Game of Thrones†because spring may be here, but winter is coming. † 1. Eat Three Cartons of Halo Top You dieted all spring break for this? How dare it rain on the one day you picked your outfit for three months ago. But let's not go too crazy here. Keep it ~low-cal~ because even with a raincoat on, dayger season is still around the corner. 2. Break Out the Mimosas Who said this carefully crafted beverage should go to waste just because the sun won't come out? Mimosas are good any day, rain or shine. 3. Buy Out the Local Supply of Rain Ponchos Only give them to your friends to ensure that your Deltopia is better than everyone else's, all things considered. 4. Raid Freebirds Today of all days is when we spare all expense and opt for the guac, even though it does, in fact, cost extra. 5. Wish People a Happy Birthday on Facebook Is this still a thing? 6. Binge Watch Harry Potterù Let's be honest, this has been on the bucket list for quite some time now. But, like the bucket item, you won't do this. Not today or any day. No one should take 19 hours and 38 minutes of the wizarding world in a row. 7. Check Your Stock If your grandparents didn't invest in stock in your name when you graduated high school, then I don't believe you, and you should call them to double check. Does anyone know what they invested in? No. Do you know how it's doing? Definitely not. For all of our purposes, it's just another iPhone app taking up storage. 8. While You're at It, Check Out the Other Apps You Never Use Did you know that your iPhone has a compass on it? Or that you can use your phone to check your heart rate? And, most importantly, when was the last time you looked at iTunes? 9. Call Your Mom She misses you. 10. Go out Anyway Come on, party people! Where's that Isla Vista charisma? Deltopia is happening whether you're there or not. So stop complaining about the rain and make your own good time! † Gia Cephal is a fourth-year sociology major who wants you to call your mom instead of going to Deltopia.

Below is a †comprehensive diagnostic test, created by the Center for Disease Control (you know, the one that saved us from Ebola), that establishes whether or not you have been infected. The test is simple. Read the three paragraphs below. Once completed, find the nearest cat and objectively observe your response. If your response is positive, you are diseased. Seek medical attention immediately.  Toxoplasma gondii Test: Version C You have reached the end of the Toxoplasma gondii Test. Now, find the nearest cat and objectively record your response. If you are repulsed by their parasitic, ungrateful nature, congrats. You are sane and healthy. If you still feel an attraction to them, then there is a 100 percent chance you are diseased. Seek treatment immediately, before you end up buying a cat, which is exactly how the spread of the T. gondii parasite is perpetuated.

Not only does she like them, but Evert went on to say that she in fact feels greatù in them, claiming that they're a real confidence booster. It would seem as though, unlike every woman to ever live anywhere, Evert's low-rise jeans have allegedly never given her a whale's tail and have never once encouraged her body to merge into the traditional muffin topù so commonly seen on women dawning the look.  Readers will remember low rise jeans as the it-jeanù of the early 2000s. †After making many an appearance on stars like Lindsay Lohan and Jennifer Aniston, they faded into the quiet oblivion of fashion's past, where they were thought to lay in peace with other relics, like the layered tank top and the necktie belt. However, against the odds, Evert has found the confidence to revive them (probably because she's super pretty and can do stuff like that). I don't know why more people don't wear them! They look great, and they're super comfortable!ù claimed Evert, despite almost unanimous pushback. Time will tell if her newfound confidence will prompt other women on campus to take their own low-rise relics out from the bottom of their dresser drawers to wear them for the first time since our collective middle and high school peaks.  Though prompted, Evert refuses to acknowledge that she has the waist for them (which she does). It should also be noted that Evert never wears a bra and her tits still look fantastic, and she never gets bloated, even when eating Mexican food. Good for her, I guess.  † Emma Demorest is a first-year writing and literature major who's waiting for croc jibbitz to make their comeback.

It was frustrating, you know? I'm trying to get to my car and have to endanger myself due to Newton's 15th Law, which is completely irrational,ù Munzer said.

The university determined that the little money it currently spends on C.A.P.S. wasn't even worth it, honestly,ù and that the walk from the Arbor Subway to the University Center Subway is waaaaaaay too long.ù Students have responded positively to Chancellor Yang's announcement of the total elimination of mental health services.  At least the wait times will be way shorter,ù said third-year English major Jessie Marcus.  University spokespeople cited long waits and understaffing for the decision to cut the program.  Subway is just the logical decision here î getting a sandwich is much quicker than a psychologist appointment. Also, C.A.P.S. isn't really the cash cow that Subway is,ù the Office of the Chancellor said in an email. In an effort to minimize the loss of the psychologists currently employed by C.A.P.S., the university announced that all counselors will be offered full-time positions at the new Subway.  † Hannah Jackson can be found in the Counseling & Career Services Building waiting an eternity for her C.A.P.S. appointment.

daily-stench,I Don't Know What Chancellor Yang Does Exactly and at This Point I'm Too Afraid to Ask,19-Apr-18,11:07 AM,['Vianna Mabanag'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/i-dont-know-what-chancellor-yang-does-exactly-and-at-this-point-im-too-afraid-to-ask/,"Nexus File Photo A great woman once said, Always ask questions because there's probably someone else in the room who wants that same question answered.ù  So with that preface, I'll be honest. I have no idea what Chancellor Yang actually does, and at this point in my college career, I'm too afraid to ask.  To be fair, I must admit that this comes from my dumbass-ness rather than his failure to do things that I notice. It's not his fault. I bet he's so great that he operates secretly, like those construction workers who build a whole McDonald's restaurant overnight. Am I comparing Chancellor Yang to McDonald's? Yes. I love McDonald's.  But I'm pretty sure Chancellor Yang does plenty of things ì I just don't know what specifically because I am ignorant. (And yes, after I write this I will Wikipedia what it is that he actually does, but for now I am grateful to have at least exploited my ignorance for a shitty article).  For example, I know he does important things. Important things that require the title of Chancellor. According to my source (UCSB Meme Cuisine for Horny Teens), Yang chancels but he also cancels. But what else? And more importantly, what does that even mean?  I suppose the problem lies with the fact that I have unreliable sources and poor research skills and now just thinking about it I probably have a weak sense of knowledge in general. But that's beside the point.  One time I saw Chancellor Yang walking by the lagoon and I became starstruck. I also blushed. But in hindsight, I now realize that I was starstruck for all the wrong reasons. I knew that he was an important figure (a godly figure, if we must jump to conclusions) ì but was that all there was to him?  Therefore, I refuse to believe that Henry ì Henry T. Yang ì is simply just a Chancellor. He is more than that. He is also a dad. A dad who thinks about and protects all of his children. All 24,346 of them.  So for that, I thank you, Chancellor Yang, or Dad for short. Keep doing what you're doing. You're doing great, sweaty.  † You might not know Vianna Mabanag but perhaps you might know her father, Henry î Henry T. Yang.

With Spring Quarter now up and running, many students at UCSB wonder how this trend will continue, what natural disaster(s) are in store next for us all? In an effort to have students ready for any sort of scenario at the drop of a hat, we here at the Daily Nexus have listed all the most likely events that could go wrong this Spring Quarter.  † 1. Tsunami Very likely under the pretense that the school is next to the ocean. On a smaller note, the vegan portion of the student body has been very excited about all of these 100 percent all-natural disasters this year. Also, it's probably due to climate change. 2. Super Volcano Many are concerned that the recent earthquake is connected to a series of subterranean chain-reactions possibly leading to a volcanic eruption at Yellowstone National Park. Despite the fact that it's a fair distance away, we will no doubt experience some kind of, if not a physical, fallout from it.  3. Tornado A pretty basic one, cut and dry so to speak. But, if my apartment does indeed get hit by a tornado and lifted off the ground, I'll be severely disappointed if I don't see a cackling woman on a bicycle outside my window, just saying. 4. Giant Sinkhole Completely Engulfing the Whole School All of the gophers, moles and other underground critters come out of hibernation beneath the school, creating a large underground cavern large enough to engulf the whole school. A catastrophe that could only be described as holy mole-y.ù  5. A Swarm of Locusts  It happened in The Prince of Egypt,ù didn't it? 6. Volcanic Eruption at Santa Ynez Mountains I know what you're thinking, That's not even a volcano,ù or Shouldn't people be more worried about Yellowstone?ù But anyone that took AP Human Geography in high school can tell that this is clearly a diversion by the mountains to sneak attack us when we have our backs turned ¶ Nice try, mountains. 7. The Plague. Just, The Plague. Yup, that's right. The Plague. How is it going to happen? I don't know. Isn't there no chance in hell the plague would come here?ù I'm sure that's exactly what people that caught the plague told themselves in 1347, but who's laughing now? Me.  You've been warned.  † Clayton Alexander is a fourth-year communication major that has come up with his own survival plans for each of these disasters, in addition to 30+ other scenarios not listed here.

So I was there sitting on my bed when I noticed my roommate get up to use the restroom,ù Carlson began. From then on all I heard were two plops, a flush, then boom. Done. I couldn't believe it.ù  But surprise wasn't all Carlson felt when her roommate pooped very quickly. She also felt intimidated.  Who the fuck does she think she is? Too busy not to take her time?ù Carlson explained. Usually when I need to blow ass it takes me 10 minutes at minimum. Mostly because I never know when I'm really done, you know? One minute it's like a faucet but the next it's like I'm giving little booty births to raisins.ù  After a few minutes of really just thinking about it, Carlson realized that the problem probably wasn't her roommate's average shitting time, but rather her own diet.  I can never decide if I want to eat healthy or not, so one day I'll eat a banana but the next I'll eat Buddha Bowls,ù she said. I can see now why my asshole would be confused î constipation is really just a complex subject. College really does teach you things.ù † Anikka's observations reflect that of the university's concern of the very deadly (but useful) D.A.D.S.S. î Day After Drinking Shitting Syndrome, which is predominant within UCSB students during the first weeks of a quarter.  † Vianna Mabanag does not poop, has never even pooped and does not even plan on pooping anytime in the near or far future.

Jameson, a first-year Ph.D. candidate in the university's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management hoping to study environmental engineering, has high hopes for the duration of his five-year program here at UCSB.

A quick YouTube search displays videos that include excessive partying, drunk antics and even a riot.

We love Barstool Sports!ù Brohanski said, with Sendet nodding in agreement.  You know how some people use the bible as guidance in everyday life? We use Barstool Sports. We ask ourselves what would get us on Barstool Sports every morning when we wake up, and that's basically how we make our life decisions.

Well, it's 1:30 in the afternoon and you're a little dehydrated, but you have few complaints overall. You safely managed to make it to your best friend's couch, the holy trinity of your keys, wallet and phone are all still together and you have a whole Sunday to recover and procrastinate on your homework. Life is all right. As you meander out the front door of your buddy's 65 DP duplex, a moment of panic hits. Where is your bike? Your mind races to puzzle together the jigsaw of your inebriated shenanigans, and the gut-wrenching realization comes over you.  No, your bike was not stolen. It's safely locked up ¶ on the 68 block of Trigo Road. The Isla Vista Walk of Shame is upon you.  Sounds like a nightmare, right? However, for third-year sociology major Richard Hertz, this nightmare became his dark reality. While the Walk of Shameù is typically associated with a morning trek home after a sexual escapade, the Isla Vista edition holds a different connotation.  UCSB professors, scholars and multiple Nobel Prize winners define the Isla Vista Walk of Shame as the sorrowful walk one makes to retrieve their bike after shamefully abandoning it the night before.ù I knew it was a bad idea to go to that pregame! It was on the fucking 68 block of Trigo! Only families live over there.ù said Hertz. I was already five or six shots deep once we left the house, so I didn't even think to bring it back home before heading out.ù  What made it even worse was the fact that Hertz was still wearing the same costume from his American-themed party the night before.  Yeah, that was definitely a strange sight to see. I originally thought it was just a belligerent Trump supporter,ù an anonymous Del Playa Drive bystander said. I was just chilling on my balcony enjoying the sun when this fully-grown man came trudging down the sidewalk in a òBack to Back World War Champs' shirt and an American flag speedo. Which, personally, I think is pretty offensive. I mean, imagine your junk touching the American flag.ù As Hertz trudged down the sidewalk on his approximately 15-minute-long journey, it was reported that multiple Isla Vista residents stopped to observe him, snapping pictures to shame him on the school's multiple Facebook pages. Obviously I feel bad for the kid,ù said sophomore Isabella Torres. But I did exploit his embarrassing moment for 200 likes on the meme page, so I actually don't care at all.ù With his confidence in shambles, Hertz arrived at his bike, swung his bare, pale legs over it and biked off into the Isla Vista distance. No doubt stopping at 7/11 to pick up a large Gatorade. † *Every weekend, approximately 30 students make the Isla Vista Walk of Shame. Don't go to pregames at Santa Ynez. Don't be another statistic.  † Kian Karamdashti has definitely never ever participated in the Isla Vista Walk of Shame, but he did once down a large, lemon-lime Gatorade in 8.3 seconds on a Sunday morning.

However, Rachel replied, idk, because isn't there something with like yeast?ù And Tiffany asked, what's Passover?ù  Literally no one gave me a straight answer, which was like¶ super frustrating. I mean, this shit is serious and it just seems like people just think itòs a joke. My grind, tryna be the best Jew and man I can be, is just like, not a joke though,ù Noah said, when asked how he felt about the responses.  Noah did not let the subpar female responses stop him on his quest of solving the problem about whether or not pussy is kosher. So, he took Rachel's yeast lead and ran with it. Proud of his research and newfound understanding of female biology, Jacob concluded that vaginal yeast is natural, not commercially produced, making it a non issue for the question of whether pussy is kosher. Even though Jacob has continued to research this question, to this day he still does not know the official answer. However, Noah plans on eventually asking his rabbi, who he has not contacted since the seventh grade, in hopes of finding an answer.  Noah's pressing question reflects not only a deep commitment to his religion, but a commitment to female pleasure. In a sense, Noah is simply trying to liberate that pussy, like God liberated the Jews. For all of those wondering, the pussy can be liberated over Passover because pussy is neither kosher nor nonkosher. What does that mean? It's pussy eating season all year round! Except for Yom Kippur¶ because nothing is supposed to get past those lips on Yom Kippur. † Camille Horenstein feels like a bad Jew because when she was asked this very question on Deltopia, she genuinely did not know how to answer. 
Print Imagine if Camille substituted Moslem for Jewish. The backlash would be enormous. surely it depnds on wether or not the pussy in question is Jewish or Goishe

The strike, which began Monday morning, was organized †to protest low wages and has since gained impressive support from students and workers across the UC. It is suspected that the wide attention from local and statewide news outlets and the impact of the systemwide strike is what finally forced a direct response from the UC, as well as this additional clarifying statement. We honestly just don't get it,ù the UC stated in their befuddling proclamation. This is specifically in response to the report that collected data from UC employment records, which stated that non-white employees, as well as female employees, were hired into lower-paying titles and given lower average hourly starting pay rates.  The statement went on to read, So what?ù  I just don't know why everyone is acting so surprised all of sudden. Did they not know that we've been successfully doing this for years?ù a UC spokesperson said when asked to elaborate on these newly presented views. † In an effort to stand up to UC and hold it accountable, the workers are demanding what is essentially basic equality for all, regardless of ethnicity or gender. Naturally, the UC delayed its response because it really had to think whether or not this is worthwhile investment. As a public institution that strives to contribute to the education and enlightenment of American society, UC stands by its decision to preach about progression and equality, yet do the exact opposite. We put your money where our mouth is,ù†the statement continued. That is, we use what should go to workers and students to fund our elaborate, seven course dinner parties. We thought that was obvious.ù The UC went on to express concerns about the future of the institution in regard to the strikes. Hypothetically, if the UC were to give workers the rights and equalities they demand, they fear they may have to start doing the same for all students, as well. Given the success they've had at intermittently keeping students mildly content, they fear giving such power to the workers might disrupt their entire balance of systemically employing denial and deflection tactics in relation to such large issues. The UC has not released any additional, additional statements or clarifications, as they are currently enjoying a leisurely lunch. Updates to follow. † Trigh Me is a student journalist with too much self-esteem and very little patience.
Print fake Union is just as racist and corrupt as UC except they don't pay as good. This is all a ploy so organizers can tax workers harder with dues while they live it up. They have no moral high ground in this.

It's Chad here, your trusty bro-expert on all matters regarding getting paid and getting laid. Today I wanna tackle a subject that's been on everyone's minds lately: moms. We all have them ì even if you don't have a belly button, like me.  But that's besides the point. I want to focus on a more serious issue: Are moms girls? Like, I know that my mom is obviously a mom. But in a much more realer sense, my bros, I'm not totally sure if she's a girl.  Before I continue diving ass-deep into this age-old question, I feel like I should explain to you the difference between my mom, an angel who always offers to make me food, and a girl, who's never once offered to pay for me whenever I text her at 1 a.m. asking if she wants to get dank nachos at Freebz and then chill at my place later.  Right off the baseball bat, I don't think moms are girls because girls are hot and my mom, Meredith, is definitely not hot. My mom doesn't have that rockin' bod Ashley McHuffington (girl) from gen chem used to have before she got prego and had that gnarly aborsh. So I definitely don't think moms are girls.  My dudes, if I could explain on a deeper level, it would go like this: girls are like Ms., but moms are like Mrs. If you can't understand this concept right now, don't worry because I created an equation to help you. It took me a long time to come up with, so it's totally chill if you can't understand it right off the hoo-ha.  Moms = Mrs.  Girls = Ms.  Moms â† Ms.  Girls â† Mrs.  As you see, moms are far more superior beings than girls because of the extra rù in their title. Girls have nothing on a title that implies male ownership. Therefore, moms are definitely not girls. You're welcome. But all in all bros, it doesn't matter what we think about this whole shebang. Moms are women and should be respected as such. So I guess in the end we really don't know if moms are girls or not. But regardless the answer, my bros, I think we should all just take part of the holiday festivities and call our moms to ask for money to buy them a present.  † Chad DeLabia is a first-year biopsychology major whose main hobbies include respecting women and riding his motorized skateboard from Embarcadero Hall to I.V.

Many students have found themselves victims of the bird, who likes to viciously dive on students' heads from its perch atop the UCen. Students have come together to ponder why a little bird would do such a thing, and now we know why.  In a series of anonymous tips, it has come to the attention of the Nexus that outgoing A.S. President Le spends his days sitting at the top of Storke Tower, waiting to send the bird to swoop on students who have slighted him, either by voting no on the NewCen, or by making memes about him on UCSB Zesty Meme Cuisine for Horny Teens.  Le, who claims he is totally fineù with the NewCen not passing, has trained the UCen bird to attack as a project to ease his transition out of the presidency, as well as to fill up some free time.  As a graduating senior, I really have nothing better to do,ù Le said as he signaled the bird to steal a Dorito out of a freshman's hand.  Raising his binoculars, Le spotted a student who had personally scorned him during the petitioning phase of the NewCen project.  This is for the record-breaking 81.69 percent of students who voted òno' on the NewCen!ù he yelled, as he descended the bird onto the man. Students were mildly surprised to learn that Le is behind the relentless bird attacks.

White Bread Ah, yes, this staple of the American diet is at the bottom of the food chain. No, this isn't racist. My health is screaming for me to put this bland-nothing down î and it didn't even say anything when I ate six Hot Pockets. 4.

Would 10/10 only eat if there were no other options beside the aforementioned white bread. 3. Matzah The most underrated bread of them all.

daily-stench,The Real Vote on Divestment Was the Friends We Made Along the Way,18-May-18,4:20 AM,"['Ollie Tabooger', 'Mookie']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-18/the-real-vote-on-divestment-was-the-friends-we-made-along-the-way/,"† Courtesy of E! UCSB î After spending the better part of a 12-hour Associated Students Senate meeting on Wednesday that refused to pass the agenda to be able to vote on a resolution to divest from companies that profit from alleged human rights violations in Israel and Palestine, Associated Students unanimously came to the decision that the real vote was on the friendships made along the way.  I know we didn't decide on anything or even discuss it, but I was stoked to get to sit next to my buddy all night,ù stated one of the 12 senators who walked out, never to return. We left to bond over some early morning Caje acai bowls!ù she continued, referring to the abrupt 5 a.m. meeting end.  The Senate had wasted no time in deciding that 10 hours of sitting in place would be enough time to convince people that they were really thinking about things.

I realized early on that if I scrunched up my face and made good eye contact, students would think I was listening to their point of view,ù added another senator.  Halfway through the meeting, a group of a dozen or so of these senators concluded in their secret group chat (~*A$ $eNaToRs*~) that it'd be easy enough to sit in both a state of boredom and one of feigned concern for what the 89-or-so speakers had to say.  We call it our two-state solution,ù a senator told us proudly, elaborating on how he handled the situation. My mom says I'm really accomplished for my age,ù he continued, refusing to note that people in other parts of the world are, in fact, dying.  The actual vote on divestment will be postponed, potentially until next week, but the friendships made along the way are strong and well. † Ollie Tabooger and Mookie hope to inspire A.S. to actually do their job, even if it's hard sometimes.

This is shocking, considering that they live literally everywhere on campus. There's one for every tree, and one can hardly go a few seconds without hearing their characteristic woo-woooooo-woo, emanating from some nebulous point in space. woo-woooooo-woo I imagine that birds are just something that people simply don't pay attention to. We're so busy planning, thinking about the future and commuting around campus with our brains effectively on autopilot that we miss the cacophonous chorus of birdsongs playing out right above our heads and only notice it when it is absent. Even if one were to detect the doves' signature call, they would still have a hard time laying their eyes on the actual dove, because it's practically invisible. The doves are tan, the trees are tan, the buildings are tan, the sidewalks are tan, the people are tan, the dirt roads are tan, the tanbark roads are tan, you get the point: the doves camo with everything. It doesn't help that the doves are small enough to fit in your hand, which means that at a range of 20 meters (a typical tree height) the dove appears smaller than a penny held at arm's length. For such a noisy bird, these doves sure are stealthy. It's such a shame that knowledge of these majestic creatures flies over the heads of so many people (pun totally intended), because for a bird commonly associated with symbols of peace and love, the Eurasian Collared Dove turns out to be one of the most aggressively territorial birds I have ever seen. All of that wooing? That's the doves' way of claiming territory. Imagine if human border policy worked that way: instead of negotiating national borders and drawing arbitrary lines, people would just build radio towers everywhere and broadcast their territory over any land covered by the towers' signal range. That's basically how Eurasian Collared Dove politics works; they spend half of their day projecting borders, yelling at other doves to stay off of their property or trying to find a mate. Another fun fact about doves (and birds in general) is that 90 percent of their calls boil down to variations of screw you!ù or I want to screw you!ù If your bird-watching skills are up to the challenge and your bird-calling skills are on point, you can very well get into an argument with a Eurasian Collared Dove, and believe me, they will woo back. Sure, humans write deeds to prove property ownership, but the fact of the matter is doves can't read. So, if the doves claim sovereignty every square meter of campus, and each one is territorial enough to wield a Gadsden flag, then we technically all live on their turf. Sure, humans write deeds to prove property ownership, but the fact of the matter is doves can't read. All of our documents and bureaucracy is meaningless noise to them; all disputes settle through screaming and more screaming and the last time I checked, humans don't scream very often. Boom. We all live in a dove-eat-dove world now. The best place to find these doves is the area between Storke Tower and the Humanities & Social Sciences building. That area in particular is in a state of constant strife as numerous doves fight out an unending turf war. We should be thankful that the doves are too quarrelsome to form a united dove community because they could easily form a minor world power if they did. One thing is certain, however; we live in the shadow of the Eurasian Collared Dove. † Yevgeniy Yakusevich is a†third-year Physics major with a knack for birdwatching.

Robberts went on to demonstrate how the accident occurred using the 1:35th scale diorama of the room that they'd been up all night constructing î we were all very impressed and proud.  The coffee was spilled in the seventh row, Robberts reported. The perpetrator, who has now been apprehended, had knocked over their Arbor coffee which quietly ran down the sloped floor of the lecture hall, destroying the backpacks of five unsuspecting students before reaching the bottom. It then pooled under the moccasins of a sleeping senior in the front row. No one saw a thing¶ Not before the damage had been done,ù Robberts added.  One student whose backpack had been a victim in the event, senior Angelina Jodie, lamented, it's a damn shame¶ my backpack was just four weeks away from retirement.ù Jodie went on to note that with her backpack gone, there was really no point to even go to class anymore. It was a terrible accident that could have been avoided,ù Robberts added on to this sentiment. This person could've just gotten the small coffee and killed it on the way to class, but no. They had to get the large with 70 percent Almond Milk.ù  Despite being a sophomore with no club affiliations, the perpetrator will be tried in court as a senior in Greek Life due to the gravity of their crimes. They could likely face anywhere from 20-30 hours of mandatory Arbor Tabling for A.S., or even CALPIRG.

It's like UCSB is paying homage to the voyeuristic sex gods who overlook our campus, and with a tower dildo, we can worship these sex gods without having to sacrifice freshman virgins.

Soccer Ball Anal Beads  Harder Stadium might be the home of natty champs but with these soccer-inspired anal beads you'll be the champion of the Santa Barbara sexathon. Trust us, these anal beads will leave you Harder than the stadium. 3. Ole Approved Whip  What else do you need for your BDSM fantasies than an Ole tested and approved whip?

A Bike-Powered Vibrator  UCSB is the home of bike traffic, why not make your frantic pedaling as you're late to class worthwhile by charging your vibrator with the energy from your bike? It's called multitasking, folks, plus we all know you were late to class because you couldn't get your girl to finish, at least do her this favor with a vibrator. 5. A Full-Sized Raccoon Fursuit  The unofficial mascot of UCSB is actually the official mascot of our underground fetish culture! Channel your weirdest fucking kinks and put this raccoon fursuit on and savagely racoon fuck your way through IV! Bonus points for banging in a dumpster.  6. Academic Butt Plug  What better way to remind you of the feeling of failing another ochem midterm than getting a massive XXL buttplug shoved up the ass. Bonus: your now loose and useless asshole will give you preparation in coping with the future uselessness of your degree! 7. Egg Chair Sex Swing  Relax while you're gettin' down.

Using her own ingenuitive techniques, Whisman was eventually able to escape by utilizing nearby strawberry-flavored lube as an effective agent in breaking her arm free. If it had not been for the lube and her own quick thinking, Whisman insists, she would have both stayed up the whole night and been ultimately really uncomfortable.  At first I was scared. I've seen that movie, I know what happens to James Franco, and honestly, I didn't know if I'd come out with an arm or not. All I knew was, I wanted to get out of there,ù stated Whisman.  What's worse, Whisman's hookup is reportedly a UCSB discus thrower. I knew based on his size I wasn't gonna last the whole night.ù  Whisman describes having mediocre sex, followed by half-hearted spooning during which her hookup, who will remain unnamed, fell into a deep sleep.  Usually I never spend the night after I hook up with someone, but it was so late¶ I kind of figured I would tough it out,ù she said.  But between the noticeably unwashed, stretched jersey sheets, the snoring and the beer farts emitted from her partner, sleep was far from her mind. It didn't help that he had rolled on top of her once-free arm. For hours, Whisman lay awake. I was so thirsty,ù she recalled. I kept trying to get enough spit in my mouth to kind of swallow, †to trick my body into thinking it was water, but it didn't work,ù Whisman reported. I kept thinking, òHe has to have a Brita, or running water or something.'ù But she was stuck. At 4 a.m., Whisman had had enough. I remembered he had put some lube (that he always pulls out but never really uses) by the bed.ù Applying it to her arm, Whisman was able to successfully unwedge herself.  I'm no hero,ù Whisman insisted to the press. I'm just a girl who wanted to sleep in her own damn bed.ù  † Emma Demorest is a first year-writing and literature and film and media studies double major who loves her own bed more than any man.

daily-stench,10 Reasons Why San Nic Is so Sick I'd Suck its Dick,5-Jun-18,4:20 AM,['Nicola Nicoli'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-05/83445/,"Courtesy UCSB Conference Services With Spring Quarter coming to a close, I have started reflecting on my oh so lovely freshman year. I had the absolute pleasure of residing in San Nicolas Residence Hall, spending a whole extra quarter with my lovely hallmates.  It is my strong belief that San Nic is the greatest residence hall to reside on this great campus. It has taught all of its residents and pushed us to be better people. I am eternally grateful and am in great denial that I will be moving out into IV next year. San Nic, you're so sick that I'd suck your dick.  You are a 9.8/10, no question about it.  Cutting down the list of highlights of the 2017-18 San Nic experience to 10 was difficult. These were the 10 most meaningful experiences, gifts and opportunities that San Nic blessed us with :) 1. The Yak that resided outside of the girls bathroom for over two weeks.  While someone of authority put chips in it, it kept us out of the bathroom for the time it remained. It was San Nic's way of saving the environment by limiting my bathroom water consumption. 2. Yak in the elevators. It forces you to take the stairs. Not only do you get that bubble butt, but you are being friendly to your environment. 3. The bloody pads and entire wigs left in the showers.  You can just collect the hair and sell them as full wigs. Works as a fundraising idea or can work to curb that universally hated college student budget. The pads keep us out of the showers, which also does its part in helping save water.  4. Roommates that hook up with their mans when you are awake. An awesome bonding experience that also taught us how to be effectively heavy sleepers.  5. A lingering smell of used condoms that penetrates the hallways. Nothing works better to mobilize college freshman to use protection. This is so important, because if you don't use protection, You will get chlamydia and die.ù 6. The overwhelming smell of rotten fish in the lounge. It gave us the push we've all always needed to go vegetarian #savingearth. 7. The bed bugs. A lounge sleepover with all the stranded really brought our floor together. Who needs a bed when you have a mysteriously stained couch? 8. An entire laundry room that goes out of service. Obviously, not washing your clothes saves water and energy. But, no access to laundry serves as a fun challenge to be creative and make new outfits. Who knew that turning shirts and socks inside out could be so trendy!?! 9. People that have sex in the shower right next to the one you are currently using. This is just a reflection of how close we have all gotten. Boundaries literally do not exist. It's also a clear cut example of how considerate roommates in San Nic are. They would rather fuck with other people around them in a fungus infected, hair-covered stall than sexile their roommate.  10. Bathroom pubes situations and bathroom biohazards.  Seeing all of those pubes in their natural, glorious beauty gives us the confidence we need to rock the full bush look. Also, because of the biohazards, you can't even enter the bathrooms to shave it off! † Nicola Nicoli is a freshman that urges all incoming freshman to sign up for San Nicolas as their first choice housing choice and San Raf and Manzanita as their second and third choices.

daily-stench,UCen Post Office Staff Think They're Better Than You,6-Jun-18,4:20 AM,['Anat Katzir'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/ucen-post-office-staff-think-theyre-better-than-you/,"Courtesy of WikiCommons A new hierarchy has presented itself at UCSB. Not related to Associated Students or the Office of Student Affairs, rather the University Center Post Office. Jaime Roth, a fourth year at UCSB said she had never experienced this kind of derogatory conversationù with a peer before. Upon entering the UCen and descending the stairs, she walked over to the post office counter and waited in line. A student then turned to her and stated that he was at the post office yesterday attempting to mail a letter, but the guy working the counter made him cry so hard he left and was trying his luck again. This type of attitude has resulted in an incline in self esteem struggles this quarter as analyzed by a survey put out by the Daily Nexus last month. The survey collected student input before and after interacting with post office staff.  Another student, who chose to remain anonymous, chronicled his attempt to send a Mother's Day letter a few weeks ago.  I took a good five minutes out of my day to go to the UCen Post Office and was ready with debit card in-hand to pay for the stamps to mail my letter.ù  Unfortunately, for whatever fucking reason, payment at the UCen post office is cash-only.  Reportedly, an employee then leaped from behind the counter like crazed animal yelling, we don't take gaucho bucks here.ù  The student offered to go to the ATM and get some cash, but was met with some more intense aggression.ù The student vowed to never go back to the post office sans cash because, those students behind the counter are ruthless with their judgement.ù The Nexustentialism staff was curious to find out more, so Monday afternoon we sent in one of our associate reporters, Stefani Choo, undercover to snail mail to a friend back home. Stefani was also ready to pay with a debit card, but was met with the same distaste for plastic by the UCen post office staff as her peers.  This must stop, and by reporting on this issue the staff at Nexustentialism hope to persuade this hierarchy to dissolve back to their old waysîit's what we all prefer.  † Anat Katzir doesn't understand people's need to mail letters. Use txt msg, dude.
Print I'm all for writers using satire to take people and groups down a peg, or to point out the ridiculousness of a situation. This satirical piece is attempting to make fun of the cash-only aspect of the post office, which is fine (not exactly the Onion), but the title doesn't indicate this so it just seems like a slightly cruel insult at first skim. Has the ucen post office really victimized anyone other than this writer? yes. Yes yeah yes! only about 16 times victimizedù lol I think that term means a lot more if you've lived or been to countries where real victimization occurs. i think there is a line between satire and being mean and i think this crossed that. SHAME ON YOU NEXUS. SHAME ON YOU. no No u Post office takes gauchobucks #fakenews The post office does take Gauchobucks though¶.. I mean I've never had a problem with them, but I always bring cash.

Apparently, Davis chose a major she figured many men would also choose. She'd try for biochem or engineering for better prospective husbands, but girls just aren't smart enough.  Things the already-23-year-old Davis has tried in order to find a provider include but are not limited to: casually walking around the engineering building, pretending to drop all her books by all the physics classrooms, sitting alone for hours at Pizza My Heart and stretching a lot in spandex by the men's locker room at the Rec Cen.  It's so sad because Sidney's like, really pretty,ù says sorority sister and friend Andrea Stevens. I mean all our friends have boyfriends î Aiden and I are basically engaged î and she hasn't dated anyone in like a year.ù  Davis found brief success as a freshman, dating Nathan Alvarez. According to friends, Davis was immediately attracted to him because of his stability, both emotionally î but more importantly î physically. Alvarez could stand super straight, meaning their children would have great posture, a feature Davis found alluring. However, the couple split a year later after Alvarez made plans to head up to Mammoth the same weekend as the Delta Phi winter formal. It was here Davis allegedly realized his priorities were not in check, and she's been alone from then on.  Since then, Davis has been focusing on finding a provider by not looking so desperate and staying classy. However, as graduation approaches, the desperation has been seeping out of her eyes.  As Stevens put it, You can see it in all our grad photos. She's got a great smile, but her eyes are pretty wide and dead.ù  Questions Davis has about not finding a provider in time for graduation include but are not limited to: Who will she clean for? Who will protecc her? How will she pay for land? A home? Who will she help in the field come harvest time?   All the best to Davis, who will undoubtedly fall victim to many wedding videos on YouTube of all of her friends caressing their college sweethearts in vineyards and rolling lawns to an acoustic version of a song they used to smash to.  † Emma Demorest is a writing and literature major whose grandma is wrong, she doesn't look tired all the time.ù

Here we are in Week 10, and it just occurred to me that no big meteorological or geographical catastrophe has taken place. No volcanic eruption(s), no army of zombies, no Target opening. Nothing. We had a long chain of natural disasters for months. And yet, absolutely nothing has happened Spring Quarter, at least in regards to some sort of natural disaster occurring.
 
All my colleagues laugh and laugh, calling me crazy, and that all this inclement weather stuff is in the past. BUT I think there's still definitely more to come.  I mean, just think about it, you know? I'm sure at the beginning of Fall Quarter we were all just like it'd really suck if the mountains caught on fire. Not that it'd ever happen.ù Then it DID happen. And then we were like wow, at least there's no blackout or anything.ù But BOOM, we all spoke too soon, didn't we? My roommate made me take down all the pictures and lines of yarn pinned to our wall, he was afraid we wouldn't get our security deposit back, because we're not. Because of this, I can't show you how it works, but trust me, it's all connected! All of it! You see, in ancient cultures, birds are often considered an omen of future disasters! Remember the UCen bird? It's a sign! An omen! What's this all leading up to? I've really no clue, but it's gonna be big. It's going to be bigger than the number of people that transferred here for Econ and didn't get in. Bigger than the line for Panda at 2 p.m. This is just the calm before the storm, people ¶ I know it ¶ Probably ¶ Maybe ¶ Consider yourselves warned.
And that I told you all so.
 UPDATE FROM EDITOR: The author was not necessarily wrong in his predictions. There was a disaster Spring Quarter 2018 î and it was that he didn't study at all for his finals, thinking something else would happen. †

I just don't get it,ù DeLabia stated during a personal Nexus interview. I got sent to detention all the time when I was kid, so why is everyone taking pity on these children and not me? Is it because I'm white?ù  When explained to DeLabia that this was a different kind of detention, that these detention facilities were secretive and took place in sometimes unsanitary and unairconditioned bases in the middle of ass-crack America instead of a safe classroom setting, DeLabia shook his head in disagreement. Detention is detention. Doesn't matter where it is. The only difference between me and them is that I got papers to prove I was there.ù  The papers mentioned above were DeLabia's middle school detention slips, signed by the school principal.  I've also been to the drunk tank a couple times during my time in Isla Vista, which makes those camps the children are staying at look like a freakin' hotelù DeLabia continued. The Del Playa is a gnarly place.ù Sensing that Chad was definitely a headass bitch, the Nexus further attempted to inform him about the current immigration status, so he could at least give us a better statement. Below is a transcribed version of the audio-recorded interview.  Reporter: I feel like you're not understanding here.  Chad: What is there to understand?  Reporter: [Pause] Are you aware that some children in these facilities have reported being forcibly injected with psychotropic drugs disguised as vitamins to maintain their calmness?  Chad: Xanax is wild.  Reporter: Are you also aware that children separated from their parents in this context will be seriously affected in their psychological upbringing?  Chad: I lost my mom at a Chuck E. Cheese once.  Reporter: Dude. These are real people who are being denied basic human rights. All the parents want to do is bring their child to America because it's gotten so bad over where they were before. The disorganized nature of this policy also makes an easy target for human trafficking.  Chad: Traffic on the 101 was wack today.  Reporter: You really don't give a fuck do you?

With your discounted tuition you can purchase five î that's right, five î dining hall swipes! This is really quite a deal, as UCSB has four dining halls, so you get to eat at your favorite one twice! Pro tip: make the most of that $12 swipe by going on days where you can easily sneak a couple pieces of overripe fruit and maybe even a slice of potato bread out in your backpack. 3. A selfie stick: For all you dayger fiends, this will make video footage of your rad partying lifestyle so much sicker! Your selfie stick will help capture wider angles that really encapsulate the I'm trying to make my high school friends jealousù vibe.  4. A portion of your rent: Trying to make ends meet to support your dope I.V. lifestyle? This tuition decrease could contribute to roughly 10 percent of one month's rent! Noice! If you're feeling financially stable, you can keep those big bucks tucked away for when your landlord inevitably bills you for some bullshit cost ($347 for blind cleaningù my ass). Nexus File Photo 5. The Arbor: Do you know how far $60 can take you at the Arbor?? That's like¶15 croissants! Nothing inspires the jealousy of your peers like rolling through the Arbor with $60 burning a hole in your pocket. Maybe you'll even catch a new honey's eye with your big spending ¶ Go buckwild! 6. The Bookstore: You no longer have to wait for those weird quarterly sales in the middle of the UCen to buy seasonally inappropriate UCSB gear. Now you can buy your very own proclamation of school pride and crippling student loan debt at full price! Go for the quarter zip, you know you've always wanted it.  7. Your unbreakable Uber habit: Try as you might, there are just some nights (and days) you just can't get yourself to walk from the 65 block to 67. No judgement. 8. Hoe clothes: You'd be surprised how much money it costs to wear such little clothing¶  9. Drunchies: With your super awesome discounted tuition, there's no need to feel guilty indulging in your late night Freebirds or buffalo chicken cheese fries. The calories don't count until you hit your $60 limit.  10. Alcohol: No explanation necessary. † Hannah Jackson will inevitably spend her $60 on her unhealthy relationship with Panda Express.

With bold statements such as, I'll listen to any music EXCEPT country,ù and an unspoken association between uneducated rednecks and people that do listen to country music, it's no easy feat being a countryfied individual in our college town. At this point in my life, however (read: a graduate), I thought it was time I shared my own tips on living a country life in I.V. † So if you've been wondering whether or not you should bring your cowboy boots to Isla Vista, I'm here to say just go for it. Fingers crossed your friends accept your true identity as a cowgirl!  How to Be Country in I.V.:  1. Insist on playing loud country music on DP every Friday afternoon. This way, your neighbors will know for sure you're country.  2. Talk about that one time your horse picked you up from school. Everyone will be in awe of how country folk travel, even in the modern age.  3. Sing exclusively country songs on karaoke night. Redneck Woman (Hell Yeah)ù always gets the crowd moving and leaves a positive message about really not giving a shit. About anything. At all. Even when you should. ††† 4. Be progressive and country and use the inclusive y'allù when addressing a crowd on Woodstocks Trivia Night. It helps to add a slight twang to your voice so you can give off a vibe of Southern hospitalityù without actual being from a red state.  5. Those flare jeans and that plaid shirt: DO IT. Denim on denim: DEFINITELY DO IT. Stick to your roots and show everyone you can party and muck it up on the farm.  6. Teach your friends the tenets of all country songs: drinking beer, mama's cooking, driving down backroads, hometown football games and girls shaking it on the dancefloor. Oh, also God sometimes. Slowly your friends will love and understand the country life as much as you do.  As the kids say, Yee haw.ù † Maura Fox was a closeted country gal throughout college but wants you to know she loves country music and has a real horse named Rosie.

Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus The Europeans have always been ahead of us style-wise, but this season it appears they are light years beyond all of us. We sent reporter Hannah Jackson deep into Eastern Europe to forecast the hottest trends, soon to be coming our way. There seems to be nothing that unifies the people of Eastern Europe quite like their passion for jortsù (a portmanteau of jean shorts, for the uncultured). Get a jump start on the latest trend before it hits the States, and find some inspo from the many varieties of jort looks below! SUMMER JORTS: Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus The sun is shining, and these babies are perfect for you to debut your blindingly pasty legs after keeping them hidden under your jeans all winter. Tight or loose, sneakers or sandals î there's no wrong way to do jorts.  CARGO JORTS: Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Ever seen a nearly-perfect pair of jorts that you'd buy if only they had more pockets, or found yourself wishing a great pair of cargo shorts came in denim? Well look no further than the cargo jorts. Practical and stylish, the cargo jort is perfect for looking fly as hell while having extra room for your 100 SPF sunblock, a map of any city from 1999 AND the keys, phone, wallet trifecta. To really achieve the dad at a cookoutù look, pair your cargo jorts with a socks and sandals combo or some New Balance sneakers with mid-calf-length white socks.  GROUP JORTS: Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Nothing is better for bonding with your bros than some matching jorts. You can wear different washes all while maintaining cohesion.

ZESTY JORTS: Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Spice up your jorts with a funky pattern, like these zesty cheetah print cuffs. BOLD LOOKS TO ACCOMPANY JORTS: Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus Fashion favors the bold. Don't be afraid to go for a loud shoe choice like Crocs; it may seem like a lot of look, but embrace it.

Whether it's due to life's hardships or a few too many drinks during a night out, we've all met our breaking points in the streets of Isla Vista. I have often come to that breaking point in my time at UCSB, all because a boy made me cry. Whether you can relate to this or it makes you feel better about your own healthy relationships, here's a list of the top 10 places a boy has made me cry in I.V.! 10. Bill's Bus Alcohol heightens all emotions, so when you're coming back from a fun night downtown this creates the perfect opportunity for a boy to make you cry. So, yes, you guessed it! A boy has made me cry on the literal struggle bus that is Bill's Bus. 9. My House Naturally this would happen. Whether it was over a phone call or he came in person, I often cried at my house because of a boy. 8. Trigo The streets of Trigo: fun people in fun apartments that always slightly smell of baking Bagel Cafe bagels. A boy has made me cry on the actual street of Trigo and inside some of the apartments, too! 7. His house  There's nothing better than a boy making you cry while you sit on his bed fully knowing that he hasn't washed his sheets in three months.  6. Camino Del Sur  Randomly, I ended up outside a house on Camino del Sur where a boy made me cry in someone's yard for 15 minutes. 5. My Sorority Formal A boy actually had the audacity to make me cry at two separate formals that I invited him to! 4. Embarcadero Hall Because lecture isn't painful enough as is, a boy decided to go out of his way to make me cry in front of Embarcadero Hall more than any professor ever could.  3. Del Playa  Honestly, who hasn't cried on DP? On multiple occasions, a boy has made me cry on both the 65 and 66 block of Del Playa Drive.  2. Our Lyft When the surcharge for Uber is just too darn high, sometimes you have to lower your standards and let a boy make you cry in a Lyft instead.  1. 7-Eleven  When I went to 7-Eleven for some much-needed snacks, a boy found a way to turn a fun little trip into an event that caused me to publicly cry in front of the chocolate donuts.  † Ollie Tabooger is done crying over boys in I.V.!

Well you should be. Disaster lurks around every corner, so be prepared for any of the following scenarios: 1. Your roommates sacrifice you for a 4.0 If you think your roommates are talking shit about you, they may just be planning to sacrifice you to the Academia Gods for a 4.0. Beware of any freaky chants and Eyes Wide Shutùìesque robes and masks.  2. You get butane poisoning from taking a dab Not only will everyone know you're incredibly lame and that you can't hang, but dabs are stupid. Just smoke weed like everyone else.  3. You get food poisoning from the dining hall  This is a rational fear, and it definitely will happen. Prepare your digestive system accordingly. Honestly, just go vegetarian now.  4. Your floormates could spread some incredibly rare and disgusting illness Mono is too on the nose. Hand, foot and mouth disease ran its course through I.V. two years ago. Let's bring back swine flu, am I right? 5. Your top bunk roommate is a bed-wetter You may think you totally finessed the best bed in your shoebox of a triple, but all of that will change the first time you feel your blacked-out roommate's piss drip through their mattress and onto your head in the wee hours of the morning.  6. Your TA does actually hate you and low-balls your grade Nobody really knows how TAs think and grade, but your TA really fucking hates you. They die a little inside every time you show up in office hours and find slick ways to fuck with your grade.  7. You get caught in a mid-shower fire alarm This may seem like a classic cinematic trope but IT REALLY HAPPENS. You can avoid this highly-plausible scenario by never showering. † 8. Your roommate is a chronic masturbator Look, everyone needs to let off some steam every once in a while, but for the love of god wait until you're alone. If your roommate is jerkin' it all the time, seriously just move out.  9. You get caught in the crossfire of your roommate's criminal activity Possible red flags include if your roommate asks you to hang onto a large quantity of drugs or to dispose of something that looks like it belongs in an evidence lockup.  10. Your significant other is a Russian sleeper agent In this political climate anything is possible. It's gotta be super disappointing to find out your new boo thang was just using you to establish their cover all while infiltrating national intelligence, though.  11. Your one night stand turns out to be your professor Yeah this shit happens all the time. Such a bummer when the person you thought you'd never see again turns out to be teaching your class for the next 10 weeks. Best to just stay in your age range on Tinder.  † Hannah Jackson suffered from a mid-shower gas leak her freshman year. Mid-shampoo and everything.

This study was conducted by comparing ass eaters to a control group of squares. From their work, researchers found that ass-eaters were 33 percent less likely to catch airborne illnesses, such as the common cold and influenza.  The numbers don't lie,ù commented Student Health representative Jana Hackson. Eating ass saves lives.ù  She continued on to note that if a student came in after having contracted more than two airborne illnesses per quarter, student health would prescribe analingusù twice a week, more commonly known as ass eating.  Researchers took saliva samples from participants searching for traces of truffle butter to indicate analingus occurrence. It was discovered that those with higher traces of truffle butter in their saliva had a stronger immunity to common airborne illnesses as opposed to those without traces of truffle butter in their saliva.  I wanted to take my health into my own hands,ù said third-year Ashley Carlson. So I decided to start eating ass.ù  Due to this newfound trend of ass eating, statistically fewer people have been getting sick within the UCSB community.  I mean, it's 2018. Who isn't eating ass?ù Carlson continued.  Due to this groundbreaking research from the UCSB community, UC officials and the greater health community have taken a stand in support of analingus and this research. This only goes to show the power UC holds to truly make an impactful difference in the world around it. Together, anything is possible.  To quote lead researcher Joey Zones, An ass a day keeps the doctor away.ù Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus † Ollie Tanasse has not contracted the common cold in two years.

Here's my retrospective analysis of Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End.ù If you're like me, you watched the Pirates of the Caribbeanù movies more than you went to church. When people asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up, you said pirate. If they pressured you, you said pirate/astronaut. So when Gore Verbinski î famed auteur behind such classics as Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,ù Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chestù and Mousehuntù î said he'd be returning to helm the Pirates of the Caribbeanù franchise into yet undiscovered waters, you naturally felt as though whatever god you'd been praying to had finally heard your prayers. † The cliffhanger ending of Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chestù left many die-hard fans, myself included, rapaciously combing through every frame, online forum and DVD extra to find out anything we could about our favorite swashbuckling crew. What happened to Captain Jack? How was Barbossa still alive? And, most importantly, was Keira Knightley getting my letters? Be it to our delight or our chagrin, these questions were answered, and over the course of two and a half ours, a little bit of our collective childhoods came to a close.  As the lights came back on, credits rolled and our eyes adjusted to the whiplash of maturation that had just been imbued on our young minds, I think we all left the theatre somewhat satisfied. We got to see some cool sword fights, the kraken died, that British jackass got blown to bits and we finally learned the illusive backstory behind Ragetti's eye. But something happened during those next few days. The birds stopped singing like they used to. People smiled a little less. Sugar never tasted so bitter, and we all realized that a movie franchise which had started when most of us were six years old, had finally, sadly, pulled the curtain on its final frames.  The questions that we'd been so ferociously discussing at lunchtime, around open Gogurt tubes and half-eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, had had their definitive answers dropped on us like a ton of bricks. We were so busy looking for the answers that we never stopped to think about the questions. Once the verdict of the last sword fight had been decided, once the last playground battle for the high seas had been called to a close with the resounding din of the bell, once the last temporary tattoo of Captain Jack's sparrow had worn off, we'd all grown up a little more than we thought possible. Eleven years later, I've come to realize that Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's Endù was both prophetic in its execution and oracular in its wake. It showed us the binding power of art and the capability that a cultural touchstone could have on a generation. I don't exactly know where the world of the young Ryan who wanted to be a pirate ended. All I know is that it did, not with a bang, but with a whimper. † Ryan Watt is a film and English double major who gets real existential around four o'clock during the summer months.

UCSB has the fifth-shittiest school paper in the nation! Thanks, Nexus! 2. Alcohol Poisoning  Make as many noise ordinances as you want! We can still silently destroy our livers past 10 p.m. on weeknights. That's dedication! 1. Daddy issues There's a reason that the student body collectively works to mold the image of their Chancellor into the man they wish was there for them in their childhood: UCSB is one of the nation's leaders in having daddy issues!

This young lady has clearly been necking with a senior boy if she's getting the big O (or she's lying). Mia Roncati / Daily Nexus 2. The Stoner Here we have 95 percent of the student body population.

Philosophical rantings will follow your first, Heyyyy dudette.ù Mia Roncati / Daily Nexus 3. The Man-hatingù sorority girl This typically takes about two to three weeks for a sorority girl to start hating the fraternity  pledge they fell in love with at first sight, despite him blatantly labeling himself King of the  Bitches.ù Whoever Tony is has probably moved onto her sorority sister by now¶ Sorry sweetie. Mia Roncati / Daily Nexus Mia Roncati / Daily Nexus 4. The Feminist Lesbian A rare breed indeed on this campus, but they exist. What else is college for but experimenting, am I right? Can't go wrong trusting a bathroom stall.  Mia Roncati / Daily Nexus 5. The Politically Correct World Savior What's a plastic bag?! These girls have never even HEARD of such a thing. And do NOT get them started on the patriarchal, oppressive, capitalist, masculine, aggressive and  non-environmentally friendly presidential regime.  Where to find them: Campus United, baby. Welcome to Hell. Mia Roncati / Daily Nexus † Mia Roncati is a fourth-year Wumbology student and for SURE didn't write any of these quotes.

daily-stench,How to Party in Isla Vista,26-Sep-18,4:20 AM,['Hannah Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-26/how-to-party-in-isla-vista/,"Nexus File Photo The beginning of college is a little awkward. You don't know the lay of the land, and you certainly don't know the party etiquette. As a seasoned I.V. resident and partygoer, allow me to impart some of my wisdom upon you.  First thing's first: BE PUNCTUAL! These parties start at 9 p.m. on the dot, and you want to be the first one there when they open the door. For the more dedicated, I recommend bringing a lawn chair and camping out several hours in advance. This way, you get first dibs on any plastic handle of Vitali you want! Lucky you!! As for outfits, the world is your oyster. You can wear whatever you want, but ladies make sure you wear a pair of high heels î the higher the better. According to a research study from UCSB's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, men are attracted to women who can navigate social situations in wildly uncomfortable footwear. They also like women who can't run away from them as easily.  You have a lot that you should bring with you to any I.V. party, so the best move is to bring a large purse or backpack to schlep it all around. Any Isla Vista partier should carry all of the following items in any party scenario: a water bottle (duh, hydration is key), a jacket (you never know when you'll be cold), a snack (for the drunchies), keys, wallet, phone and a flashlight (it'll make finding your friends so much easier).  Sometimes as a freshman you may be mistaken for an SBCC student. The best way to combat this is to wear your UCSB lanyard around your neck at all times. To assure authenticity, buy a case for your Student I.D. to affix to said lanyard. In some cases, your perm number may be the password to an exclusive Gauchos-only party, so make sure you've got it down.  Getting to the party from your dorm is an often unforeseen challenge for freshmen. My best suggestion to you would be to travel in a very large group. The more people you have, the better your chances of getting there! If you are unsure in your natural sense of direction, feel free to bring the map given to you at orientation and ask anyone on the street, Where is the Del Playa?ù Make sure you always walk on the sidewalk to avoid being hit by some lawless bikers.  If you're feeling too drunk after a wild night of partying just take a seat on any street corner or curb. This will signal surrounding police officers that you are waaaaay out of it and could really use a water and some bread!  If you heed my advice, I can assure that you'll be partying like a pro in no time. Can't wait to see you all raging in I.V.!  † Hannah Jackson does not endorse any of the previously mentioned behaviors.

daily-stench,BREAKING: Sophomores Are Cooler Than You,27-Sep-18,4:20 AM,['Carly Kay'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/breaking-sophomores-are-cooler-than-you/,"Nexus File Photo After a long four-month break from the Good Land, incoming second-year Betty Razi is finally ready to demonstrate her newfound sense of maturity to the wittle baby freshmen. Razi, who just turned 19 in early September, is absolutely flabbergasted by the pure naivet√© of her three-month-younger inferiors.  They are literal infants,ù Razi stated. I'd be shocked if they could see over the baskets on their beach cruisers.ù In a dignified attempt to be a proper role model, Razi makes a point to loudly exaggerate the word freshmenù to her other mature friends whenever she sees a large group of girls wearing black walking down DP. This ensures that the street youths of Isla Vista know that they are being watched over by a slightly cooler group of sophisticated adult women. Back in my day, freshies were way less cringey,ù the elder explained. When I was sitting alone at Carrillo the other day, one of them introduced themselves to me, programmed themselves as Alex from Dinning Hallù into my phone AND proceeded follow me on all forms of social media. The audacity!ù In her old age, the sophomore has decided to engage in more refined activities such as complaining about having too much to fit onto her resume and picking philosophical debates with unassuming surfers trying to enjoy a good sunset. Razi looks forward to sitting on her DP balcony casually sipping an IPA in sweatpants while first-years in the shared patio below take handle pulls of plastic Kirkland-brand vodka. † Carly Kay is a third-year who often gets mistaken for an eighth grader separated from her tour group.

daily-stench,Freshman Guides: Biking on Campus,1-Oct-18,4:20 AM,['Anat Katzir'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-01/freshman-guides-biking-on-campus/,"Nexus File Photo So here's the deal: If you've committed to UCSB, you're pretty much expected to know how to ride a bike. Now, I understand some of you never learned î actually I don't understand, but we'll get into that later î so I have some survival hacks for you as an experienced cyclist of the streets of Isla Vista and campus. Let's address the biggest issue: looking cool. There's a certain vibe across this campus, and a key way to fit in is to look the part. (If you go here you obviously already have the superficial looks. I'm going to help you detect what can be added on to enhance what you already have.)  You will obviously need a bike to begin. I recommend going for a BMX-type two-wheeled vehicle. They're coming back, just like Heelys, so the best way to stay on-trend is by getting your hands on them first. You'll be the coolest kid riding between the dorm buildings, I guarantee. I want to emphasize that this would be a child-sized BMX î only these are coming back in style. Dads use adult BMXs, so if that's your thing, go for it; otherwise, stick with kid sizes.  Next, you'll need a helmet. I recommend the ones that look like they've been through a wind tunnel. You know, the ones that are pointy on the back and round up front. And you know why you need one of these? It's because safety is sexy. And you are sexy, so this is a fine addition to what you already have going on. † To keep all of this safe and accessible, you will need a bike lock. The most economical way to go is zip ties. If you're really nervous someone might come for your kid-sized BMX ¶wait, lol, what am I saying?! Everyone has one of their own, so they don't need yours. Honestly, regardless of if you're in a rush or not, don't lock your bike. You'll be fine.  Now to those of you who don't know how to ride, why the fuck don't you know?! Sorry, I'm very passionate about serious biking. It's really okay if you don't know. You can pretend by walking on the bike path on your way to class. This will guarantee you'll fit in. Sidewalks are for no one, they are lava, don't walk on them. Bikers, skateboarders and pedestrians are welcome on our one-lane bike paths.  Don't forget that during each bike ride you should pretend like you're being chased by a pack of raccoons. It's what we do here, so don't question it. You should feel like you showered in your own sweat by the time you dismount your bike and head to your class. Everyone will love you for the stench.  † Anat Katzir never attended UCSB as a freshman.

While the distance between North and South towers may feel like an eternity, the couple has found a way to make it work.  Sources say Ramsey, of fifth floor North tower, and McNamara, of ninth South, hit it off at the FT pool party when he accidentally spiked a volleyball into her poolside pod, ruining her perfectly composed Instagram shot.  Who would've thought that such a disaster could turn into such a beautiful love story?ù Ramsey gushed.  Amy and Derrick are, like, the most stable couple in FT,ù said Ramsey's roommate Tara Meyer-Williams. Seriously they've been together for two whole weeks and haven't even gotten into a fight yet.ù  When asked to divulge the secrets of maintaining such a perfect relationship, McNamara confessed that the two share a common practice of isolating themselves from everyone else in their lives and pouring all time and energy into one another.  I can't imagine my life at UCSB without Amy,ù McNamara said from the couple's usual two-person corner table at Portola. She has made these last two weeks incredible.ù  On nights spent apart, the two have found ways to communicate once their respective roommates get fed up with the couple's hours-long FaceTime conversations.  Holding a pair of binoculars to her eyes, Ramsey points out McNamara's window on the ninth floor, from which he sends the Morse code for I love you,ù using his iPhone flashlight.  I don't know what the long distance has in store for us, but so far we're doing the best we can,ù Ramsey said. We're wishing these crazy kids the best of luck! † Hannah Jackson thinks that a 65 to 68 block relationship qualifies as long distance.

Now we don't have to worry about traveling too far and can just relax with how easy it is showing our friends what a great time we are having in Europe.ù  According to EAP advisor Don Johnson, the decision was based off of the repeated refusal for their abroad students to do anything else but perform candid poses with wine, baguettes and cheese in front of the famous city overlook.

They're kind of like babies; they're dumb, loud and usually covered in vomit. The only difference is that I can't pass Freshman Freddy off to my Aunt Carol when he starts screaming, so that's why my boy Adam and I used the time machine my boy Brad has been keeping in his garage to find out about all the dumbfuck things the freshman are gonna be up to this fall. You're welcome, Isla Vista.  Since my buddy Brad is kind of a dumbass, the time machine was all fucked up from the beginning. Rather than taking us to the first day of school, it took us straight to Dec. 7, the Friday of dead week. What my boy Adam and I saw when we got out could only be described as a nightmare.  Everywhere you looked, freshmen were panicking. The library looked like something straight out of one of those movies I had to watch when I took a film class because my boy Chad and I thought it would be an easy A. In every stairwell there was a freshman girl on the verge of tears as she broke up with her long-distance boyfriend who everyone totally knew wouldn't work out. The Arbor was totally trashed. Empty americanos and white mochas littered the tables, as a bunch of nerdy-looking freshman dudes kept repeating dead weekù like they had just learned the phrase yesterday and were excited to show off how with it they were. My boy Adam was almost in tears. We hopped right back in the time machine and set off for the next freshman fuckup.  Okay, so while we were surfing the fourth dimension, Adam kind of panicked and smacked one of the dials with his Hydroflask, and we ended up on Halloween weekend. At first it wasn't too bad. One freshman girl had her giraffe onesie scrunched around her ankles so she could pee on some plants outside of an apartment complex on Embarcadero. A freshman dude had puked all over his banana costume and was threatening a dude in a gorilla suit. All of it was pretty much as it should be.  We were grubbing pretty hard at that point, so we decided to walk to Freebirds. Words cannot adequately describe the horror we felt when we saw the freshmen clamoring all over the exterior of this one great burrito mecca. One girl was leaning against the building while cheese dangled from her lip as she explained how each of the girls in her party was officially her sister but, like, more than her sister. Another drunk dude had dropped two containers of nachos and was just staring at the ground with a vacant look in his eyes. Needless to say, we didn't stick around long. Adam and I 86'd those kids, and we were on our way to our final stop.  The time machine hacked and crackled like a fresh Juul pod as we pulled into the first Monday of the new year. The sun threw all sorts of bitching streaks of light across the lagoon, and it seemed like nothing could have ruined that kickass view. That is, until the bike lanes started to fill up.  Within minutes my boy Adam and I were witness to a gnarly 10-bike pile-up, with freshmen girls on beach cruisers congesting every lane as dudes tried to look too cool too quickly by not holding onto their handlebars.You could see his freshman orientation phone case slipping the surly bonds of his hand and joining the infinite as it smacked some dude on a longboard in the face. When Adam and I finally returned to the present, we were feeling all kinds of wack emotions. First fear, then anger, then hunger, then we were just annoyed. It would have stayed that way had Adam not pulled up a video of my boy Chad and I sticking out our tongues as we showed off the Natty Daddy we'd snuck into FT the first weekend of freshman year. Maybe we were that loud and dumb once. Maybe they're not gonna stay like that forever. Maybe it's not all bad, man.  † Fraternity Phil just recently discovered online poker, so don't expect to see him around campus for a while.

To combat loneliness and the fear of missing out, C.A.P.S. now offers the Rent-A-'Rent program in which students can bond with an older human being for a few hours.

This is going to be such a waste of three months of my life,ù said Brohanski. I committed to studying all the way in Europe solely to get with foreign chicks and drink without me getting my fake ID taken, and now I can't even do half of that. I didn't come here to study abroad, I came here to study-a-broad, you know what I mean?ù When asked about the opportunity to explore another part of the world and immerse themselves in a culture they have never experienced, Brohanski replied, Fuck that shit.

Best country in the world. The home of obesity, school shootings and, you guessed it, freedom.

Denial On your fruitless walk back from the SRB after being told you have no bid, you might find yourself thinking something along the lines of there's no way this is happeningù or †there must have been a mistake.ù This is a common defense mechanism that shields the victim from realizing he won't have anyone to oil him down as he gets a pump in at the MAC. 2. Anger As the painful reality of your stinging rejection begins to settle in, anger takes the place of denial. Your first instinct is to call your daddy and tell him to talk to his connections; you must resist this temptation! A much better use of your time is to get fucked up, drag your knuckles on over to DP and approach as many girls as you can until you get bored enough to go home and rub one out. 3. Bargaining Next comes the attempted negotiations as well as an obsession with hypotheticals. You may find yourself praying to God, begging him to enact a miracle. Please, God. If you just get me into Sigma Tau Delta, I promise I'll stop putting Matthew McConaughey, Ryan Lochte and Jordan Belfort above you.ù At the same time, the if onlyù statements begin to occupy your mind, repeating on an endless loop. If only I wore my Steph Curry jersey and matching Sperrys to Sig Mu on Thursday. †If only I mentioned that my grandpa used to know Ronald Reagan. If only I studied the Greek alphabet just a little longer on Sunday.ù 4. Depression At this point, you will find yourself in a dark place. Cheap beer has lost its taste, Dan Bilzerian's Instagram doesn't have the same allure and even Lil Yachty's carefully crafted bars on Broccoliù can't cheer you up. †The mere thought of Vineyard Vines makes you want to cry, and you can't help but wince every time you hear the phrase send it.ù  5. Acceptance While the emptiness in your heart will never truly be filled, you muster up the courage to accept your current situation. You realize you must take your place among the cold-blooded hordes of fratless bros who troll up and down the streets of I.V. looking for any party that will take them in. In the meantime, keep your head high. You can always rush in the spring. † Brian Byrne is a first-year who will not be rushing in the spring.

Was this an attempt to avoid the awkward I still like you but not enough to put the effort into an LDR and also I wanna be able to hook up with randos at parties without a heavy layer of guilt weighing on top of my newly acquired freshman 15ù talk? Well, you've come to the right place. Here are the five staples of navigating your freshman year long-distance relationship before it inevitably comes to a sad and pathetic end a month and a half into the school year! 1. Sending/receiving dick pics with the words I miss you <3ù written over them. This classic sentiment is really all you need to juice up the usual, boring dick pics that are typically exchanged and add some spice into your relationship. 2. Crying into the outdoor lounge chairs because they didn't call you back and you don't want your roommates to ask questions. An obligatory measure to cope with your partner losing interest in you as the days go by! 3. Getting your S.O. to drive halfway up the state of California to visit you and spending the weekend being all over each other in a gross and definitely not socially acceptable way. What? We missed each other¶ 4. Feeling like you're single because you no longer have that special someone near you to spend your free time with. Something you'll have to get used to feeling! 5. Checking their location on Snap Map repeatedly to see when they were last active on Snapchat to make sure they're not ignoring you. Okay, we know you did this back at home, but the distance just amplifies this destructive habit. Even if your relationship does come to end, it's important to remember that when it comes to college, there are plenty of horny people willing to hook up at the drop of the hat. Although the end of your relationship is sad, it also opens you up to so many new possibilities. So get out there, Gauchos! † Jen Alcott is a first-year who has yet to be caught stealing cups from DLG.

The policy, which went into effect this month, has already seen a threefold increase in donations to saving the turtles or bees or whatever CALPIRG is harassing everyone about now.  First-year human ball of stress Gabby Stratford was one of the students targeted by CALPIRG's new fear-smelling policy.

One shudders to think of both the horrible events these sheets have lived through as well as what you'd find if you put a blacklight to the whole damn thing.

In order to stop the epidemic of boys who have to be shirtlessù because it's laundry day and don't have any clean shirts to wear,ù A2018 would allot some of the ridiculously high housing fees to purchasing shirts boys can check out on laundry day.  Measure RIPX: Written by professors at UCSB, a vote in favor of RIPX would make packing up before the end of lecture a violation punishable by fine.

daily-stench,Return of the Shack: How To Get that One Night Stand Out of Your Bed,7-Nov-18,4:20 AM,['Brock Clark'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-07/return-of-the-shack-how-to-get-that-one-night-stand-out-of-your-bed/,"Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Welcome back. It's been a few weeks, and we here at the Nexus hope you're all settled in nicely to your long lectures and tedious sections. We also hope you're all making plenty of mistakes. What mistakes?ù you may ask. Don't kid yourselves. You know what mistake we're talking about: shacking. If you're a veteran this one isn't for you, but to all you newbies, freshmen or downright nice human beings who can't get that shacker out of your bed, then here are seven ways to get him or her to become the Angel of the Morning.  1. So what are we?ù It's tried and true, nobody wants a relationship here. If you have a relationship here, good on you, please fuck off and stop telling us about it. That being said, the fear of a relationship is like the fear of being fat: †You know it's going to happen eventually, but you can hold it at bay for now. So if you need that Angel of the Morning to fly, fly away, give 'em the old, What are we?ù or, Hey this the third time, so I think this is going somewhere,ù and they will spread their wings and soar. I'm a peacock Terry; you gotta let me fly.  2.†Can my roommate join?ù Hey, if they're one of those people who wants a relationship, nothing is going to scare them more than asking if they're willing to bring someone else in. Two's a party but three's a crowd,ù is a rule that never gets old. Also, if your roommate and you plan this out beforehand it's easily one of the funniest things you could ever do î commitment sells it. 3.†Double Daddy Issues  It's totally fine to have family issues. I am not making fun of this whatsoever î I should probably be in intensive therapy for my daddy issues î but if you both have daddy issues, you're fucked and everyone knows that. There can be only one,ù is the truth here, so next time he mentions that papa didn't throw the baseball or that daddy didn't build that princess castle, you know what to do: START SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY AND INCOHERENTLY BABBLE THAT YOU HAD IT WORSE. I use this maybe twice a month.  4.†Tell them you hate dogs. This one is pretty intense, but let's get real: Who hates dogs?  5.†Pretend to be in the Witness Protection Program. This one takes some serious dedication. The gist of it is that you pretend to have seen some awful crime or, if you're a good actor, you pretend to have seen or participated in some awful crime, and now you have a new name and a new life. It's just not safe for you to be around me. This was a mistake¶ a mistake I'll never forget.ù Nothing gets 'em like forbidden romance due to a mob hit gone wrong. Also, if you have a friend call you repeatedly from a blocked number, it is the funniest fucking thing on this earth and will scare your shacker to no end.  6.†Let it slip that you fakedù that orgasm. It's honestly the easiest way to do it. Lack of satisfaction is the biggest deterrent to a relationship ever. Just ask all two of my ex's¶ or the Baldwins, I'm pretty sure they mentioned something like that at some point. It was on the quizlet.  7.†This is just what the palm reader said would happen!ù This is easily my favorite. Nobody gets freaked out more than when they hear something about a prophecy. Just the thought of tomorrow is enough to ward off people from doing homework, eating, exercising, pretty much anything aside from partying to take the stress away. Seriously guys, get a better coping mechanism. So imagine the surprise when you say that this shacker is your destiny; they will run out of your room faster than a fat kid trying to make his way to a special at KFC. I'm allowed to say that since I was that fat kid.  † Brock Clark did a stint as an investigative journalist for this piece and found out none of these work, but he might have a STD.

While some may turn to compulsively smoking stogies or crying in the library's egg chairs, freshman Daniel Diaz has taken up a record-breaking stress eating habit.  At first we didn't think it was a big deal,ù said Daniel's roommate Nicholas Wolf as he stepped over a pile of empty Flaming Hot Cheetos bags on the floor of their dorm. But pretty soon his trash took up the entire floor's trash cans, and now he's commandeered the entire Anacapa bin.ù  Diaz's case has astounded Arbor workers and dining hall employees alike. Veteran Arbor employee Rachel Lee was stunned by the sheer quantity of food Diaz bought in a single trip, noting that she had never seen someone purchase a shelf's stock in its entirety before. Portola staff member Charlie Harris added, I don't think Portola has ever run out of food before this kid showed up and practically inhaled the taco-nacho line.ù  Those victimized by Diaz's stress-eating habit include Subway workers tasked with his frequent visits and gross sandwich requests, as well as unsuspecting library-goers who are confronted with all of the weird smells that emanate from his backpack.  All sources interviewed noted that they were glad they would be long graduated by the time Diaz can enter upper division courses. This kid has a big storm coming,ù said fifth-year biochemistry major Phil Morrison.

Parents Weekend is supposed to be a time when we can stop having anxiety attacks from econ, pretend like our social lives are more than just a weekly hookup and disregard the Yerba and Aderall-induced coma we're all on the brink of, but this year we shit the bed, guys. Three out of four parents said they were either disappointed, appalled or, and I'm quoting here, downright ready to choke someone,ù after seeing what they saw. For the safety of students, the interviewees will each receive an appropriate pseudonym. 1. My Hookup's Mom Early thoughts from this seemingly random parent were highly positive. Campus Point was beautiful, and the guest lecture she got to attend reassured her that her daughter was in the right place. All this changed when the fire nation attacked.

Over-Protective  Upon Suzy's arrival, she was both happy but concerned because it looked like Gregory had the sniffles. It just seemed like he was developing allergies all of the sudden ¶ his eyes were bloodshot and he just kept sniffing.ù What Suzy didn't know was that Gregory had developed a fiendish coke addiction as well as a mildly successful business. When asked if she would return next year, Suzy candidly retorted, Not even the cornhole competition at Storke Tower will entice me to rejoin parents weekend.ù Well, boo on you, Sue, boo on you. 3. Jeff, Awkward Stepdad Jeff was invited to join Tim, his stepson, in all normal activities this weekend. They played a few rounds of frisbee golf and went paddle boarding. Then night fell and Jeff found out his stepson was a star who went shot-for-shot with everyone at Dubs (Dublin's for parent readers). It would be weird to say I'm proud of him, but I'm not not proud of him¶ù Jeff looked concerned and mildly hungover during this interview.  4. Party Mom Karen  Party Mom had a great time and got into three fraternity parties. She only wishes she could have come here sooner. This was the best fucking time I could have ever had.ù It was at this time that she looked to three bros in the corner said, I'm gonna outdrink all your little bitch asses.ù Godspeed, Karen, godspeed. † Brock Clark wants you to know that he was actually called a piece of trashù by his ex's mom once and it still hurts.

You shake with anticipation, excited as the future of your unsupervised adult life starts now. There is just one thing off about your perfect new life: your new roommates. You don't know what it is, but there is some unspoken tension permanently between you. Lucky for you, I have an answer to your troubles. I present the roommate hierarchy: Alpha: The alpha roommate is the hallmark of decision making. Oftentimes the tallest roommate, the alpha roommate may often have the largest dick of the roommates, thus exemplifying his status. He will, more often than not, be having sex nearly 24/7, with or without you in the room. His word is law, with unwanted decisions followed by the classic, We're not doing that.ù Alpha's are often hard partiers and will come to and fro as they please. Caution: Do NOT invoke the wrath of the alpha, or you may be metaphorically and/or literally separated from your balls! Beta:  The beta is often the wingman to the alpha. Though he himself may have a larger dick, he is shadowed by the personality of the alpha. In the case of larger rooms, a dual-beta situation may arise out of who is or is not the second-rate. Betas may often follow the alphas, so as to avoid the most dreaded status of all, omega. Omega: If, at this point, you may be thinking, My roommates don't do that, they are cool.ù Then, I'm sorry, but you are in fact the lowest status of roommate, omega. The omega has no willpower in the room, even though he may be in it the most. Do not be surprised if you find your sleep schedule fucked. It is probably the work of the alpha and beta cooperatively sexiling you or poking you in your sleep in an attempt to drive you insane and drop out. Not to worry, though, classes only last till June, so you can make it! † Chuck Mannsly is a second-year film studies major and former omega roommate who is *this* close to losing it.

Inspired by his childhood best friend and current NBA player Mo Bamba, Khadimoul Rassoul Cheikh Fall (better known by his stage name, Sheck Wes) famously recorded the song in one take, posting the future club banger to Soundcloud on June 16, 2017. Almost immediately, Mo Bambaù took over the club scene not only in Harlem, but all over the country despite no radio play and little chart success. This led to many cultured enthusiasts calling for it to replace the Star-Spangled Banner as the country's national anthem. I don't know one word to that flag song,ù said one fan. But imagine putting your hand over your heart as òYOUNG SHECK WES AND I'M GETTING REALLY RICH' blasts through the speakers. Patriotism would definitely rise.ù It wasn't till mid-2018, a year later, that the song went viral, with notable celebrities such as Drake, Odell Beckham Jr., and Shaquille O'Neal publicly recorded picking up on the exquisite piece of art that is Mo Bamba.ù  While the song's rocketing popularity garnered him national attention and multiple features on Travis Scott's Astroworld, it did come with a price to pay.  I haven't cried since I was in first grade, but seeing that video of all those frat dudes in suits dancing to the song made me wanna throw up,ù said another fan. It was at that moment that I knew¶ òMo Bamba' had been forever tainted. They already have Mark Ruffalo, Rex Orange County, and privilege, why couldn't they leave us just one fucking song?ù In many of the viral video and snapchats posted in the last few weeks, another issue has been uncovered. The consistent ratio of N-word use to white people in each video is very, very high. Ever since that motherfucking òFreaky Friday' song with Chris Brown and Lil Dicky, way too many white people have been screaming that word with confidence at these functions,ù said one frustrated Isla Vista resident. There is statistically no way your party at UCSB has enough colored people to match how distinct that word is over the music.ù Another lost soul taken from us way too young. Simply tragic. Mo Bambaù is survived by Crewù by Goldlink (ft.

Take it from me, I'm swole AF. 1. Always wear a muscle tank. And make sure that tank is cut slightly too much so that your nip slips just a lil as you rep. Those nip slips serve as little reminders that one day your chest will be so big you won't even have nips. 2. Stare intently at your reflection as you flex in the mirror. It's been scientifically proven that the longer you look into the mirror, the faster your muscles will grow. You might even catch them in the act of bulking if you look hard enough. 3. Grunt really loudly during every rep. If it doesn't sound like you're about to take a huge dump every time you lift a weight, then you're definitely doing something wrong. 4. Listen to classical music at full volume. You ever wonder what every other bro is listening to while they're lifting? It's Mozart, dude. His deft piano playing is crucial in stimulating the cells in your body that will swell up to get you those big biceps. Shedding a tear in memory of Mozart will get you 10 extra gainz. 5. Finally, make sure you snort lines of protein powder before, during and after every set. Doing so will maximize the amount of protein being absorbed into your muscle tissue. And make sure you drink at least double your weight in water so science can happen and cause your body to bulk up. If you have to pee every 20 minutes, that means you're doing it right.  If you follow these five tips, you'll definitely be swole before the next time you have to be shirtless at the beach. † Lizzy Mau is a first-year sustained only by protein powder and cold water.

daily-stench,Choose Your Fighter: Section Edition,27-Nov-18,4:20 AM,['Emma Demorest'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-27/choose-your-fighter-section-edition/,"Courtesy of Pexels Section classmates î we all know them, we all love and/or hate them. We're all forced to spend 50 minutes once a week with them at some point in our undergraduate careers. As much as we wish each section could include the honestly hot cast of characters from The Breakfast Club,ù reality gives us a TA whose paper grading skills are as unpredictable as a freshman in the roundabouts, accompanied by a motley group of people you'll never interact with again after week 10. Of the many considerably less hot peers you've had in your seminar, we know you've had these. So pick your fighter, choose wisely and fight to make it out of week 10 in one piece. † 1. Kelsey: Walk-of-Shame Girl Whether she did it or not, Kelsey always looks like she came into class directly from 10:45 p.m. on a Saturday. Her fake eyelashes are sagging, what's left of her hair is burned and layered in a color so platinum blonde that its unwavering glow will keep you awake during your 9 a.m. section.  Strength: Acrylic nails aid in typing with force on her MacBook Air, will weirdly know when all assignments are due.  Weakness: Only wears PinkÑ¢, walks slow.  2. Garret: Irish-Catholic White Boy Regardless of the fact that he may not actually be Irish-Catholic, the important thing here is that Garret really looks like he could be. Diligent and concise, Garret loves to come into class and always says just enough to get participation points. We cannot emphasize just how enough Garret says. Garret had one serious girlfriend in high school and is always looking for something serious.  Strength: Can depend on Garret to wear three T-shirts in rotation featuring: a local half marathon, his senior year science camp and the logo of the software company he interned for this summer.  Weakness: Wears loose, dark wash and dad sneakers, but, like, not the hot kind. 3. Amanda: Reading is Lyfe Before you ask, Amanda has read the reading for this week and did re-read it again, just for kicks. A rare bird who actually understands the reading, we're pretty sure in middle school, Amanda was either a horse girl or used a rolling backpack, or even both.  Strength: Will fill time during section by going into an in-depth analysis of the material in class.  Weakness: Will do this for four minutes before section ends.  4. Tristin: Wears Sunglasses Inside  We don't know why Tristin wears his Wayfarer sunglasses inside (that he got for free, but you all should have known that) and we're pretty sure he doesn't know, either. Besides schlepping around a messenger bag with a 20-pound HP laptop, Tristin isn't the worst guy. Except he always uses some hi-tech gaming mouse that looks like it came straight from TRON.ù Tristin plays Cards Against Humanity and Dungeons & Dragons every Friday night and will be texting his buddies about it during class.  Strength: Will fill empty void of time and space in section by making hurried, enthusiastic quips about the material or lecture. † Weakness: His laugh sounds like what a booger looks like.  5. Corey: Vague Frat Boi Corey always looks a little lost without Nick, Carson and Shaun, and he relies heavily on his frat T-shirts to help identify himself. You also can't help but feel like frat boys must be shorter when they're not in a group. Corey will bolster all his strength to respond to one question and then will be silent and deadpan for the rest of the quarter. He's not dead, though, his mind's just sleeping.  Strength: Nice. Or just expressionless.  Weakness: Will weirdly never see him at any frat party afterward.  6. Hannah: Overwound Ball of Nerves  Hannah is probably really sweet and everything, but she won't stop bouncing her leg like that. She also grips her pencil like it's the last Yerb at the Arbor during dead week. Speaking of Yerbs, has Hannah had all of them? Hannah's screensaver is of her dog and loves asking a lighting round of questions about the midterm to the TA.  Strength: Did better than you on the final. Weakness: Will not look anyone straight in the eyes. † Emma Demorest is the ideal section classmate.†

daily-stench,A Retrospective Look on No-Nut November,28-Nov-18,4:20 AM,['Harry Knutts'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-28/a-retrospective-look-on-no-nut-november/,"Courtesy of PxHere ISLA VISTA, CALIF. ì It's been all the craze. News reports have been coming out of the woodwork in regards to this year's No-Nut November. 2018 has taught us a lot about growth and change. We witnessed the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, saw Prince Harry î the man has a great namesake î get married, watched the World Cup held in Russia, observed U.S. midterm elections hit an all-time high voter turnout and, with a month left in this year, there is no telling what could happen.  But let's take a closer look at one of the most grueling months of the year î November. Men across the world have been writing to the Nexus hoping to get some legislative movement blasted across the media. Since I hit puberty it's been bad. I lay in bed wanting to pleasure myself, but know that I will be disowned by everyone I'm acquainted with for not having enough self control,ù Brett Cumbersome notes. To deal with this, some have taken it upon themselves to get into committed relationships, since that's the only way release can truly happen. An anonymous reader reports that he's only doing it so that I can explore my sexuality further. I don't want a girlfriend, but I also don't have self control, so I had to choose which of my priorities was more important. I guess I'm just a weak pussy who wants pussy.ù Jack Peen of COKS, the Coalition of Kitty Seductors, was the first to write to government officials on the matter. What the COKS proposition aims to do is dismantle the need for No-Nutting,ù Peen states. With a push for this type of change, readers should expect to see more of their peers challenge social norms while coming to the conclusion that they should be free to decide when they will or won't use their sword.  Regardless of the initial goal of No-Nut November î to raise awareness for Men's Health Month î men everywhere should expect to see a shift in the tasks asked of them during this month.  † Harry Knutts is an advocate of nutting and requests all to go sign his petition on change.org.

daily-stench,Bare Minimum Proving To Be Too Much to Ask of Subleaser,29-Nov-18,4:20 AM,['Ollie Tanasse'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/bare-minimum-proving-to-be-too-much-to-ask-of-subleaser/,"Courtesy of Flickr In an unsurprising and expected series of events, local Isla Vista resident Jackson Smith has finally realized that asking his subleaser to do the bare minimum has proven to be too much for him to handle. Though the subleaser will move out at the end of the quarter, Smith notes the remarkable impact he has had on his quality of life.  I didn't think it was too much to ask him to clean up after himself,ù Smith said. But my subleaser cussed me out when I asked him to wash his dishes after they'd been out for a few days. Not to mention they were MY dishes.ù Perhaps it was a red flag that Smith's abroad housemate didn't find the subleaser until the very last minute, but he honestly seemed pretty normal at first. It wasn't until Smith noticed that the subleaser had no basic life skills or lasting relationships that he realized something was up. In this moment, he knew in his heart that he was going to be stuck with someone literally no one else in Isla Vista was willing to live with for a full 10 weeks.  The subleaser, who asked to remain anonymous, wanted to share his side of the story with the Nexus. I honestly shouldn't have to clean things up,ù he revealed. It hurts my soft, precious, wittle hands.ù Though he wouldn't take responsibility for the household items he broke and refused to replace, he did note, Baby tired. Baby going to go nap nap now.ù We assume he was referring to himself.  While in the grand scheme of life the situation isn't really that bad, Smith has revealed that he just wishes he didn't have to assume the role of a father so early on in life. With the quarter nearing its end, the subleaser's reign of mild terror will soon be over î that is, until he must sublease in Isla Vista once again.  Smith urges all Isla Vista residents to sublease with discretion.  † Ollie Tanasse wants you to take a wild guess as to why this article was written.

daily-stench,Hazed and Confused,30-Nov-18,4:20 AM,['Brock Clark'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-30/hazed-and-confused/,"Courtesy of Total Frat Move Hazing sucks. Dad did it, America did it, but we don't anymore ¶ right? There has been a rampant increase in reports of hazing here at UCSB and frankly it makes me sick. Looks like this reporter is gonna pull trig and bring things to light, so buckle up and put those rain ponchos on because we're riding this log ride together. Our first report of hazing comes from Sigma Sigma Sigma. This report is so serious, like for real guys. Multiple pledges have been reported leaving the house in tears. This reporter caught up to one and this is what he had to say: My big said I had to fold his laundry¶ and I fucked up and put a pink shirt with his white clothes when I was folding everything.ù Dickie Roberts, the pledge at the center of this house's hazing allegations, is disheartened and knows he will never succeed now,ù just as his big said. Poor Dickie. This makes me sick. The brothers of Chi Beta were no better. We were actually invited into their house and got to observe their hazing ritual, which dates back to the early 2000s. The gentlemen of Chi Beta force all of their pledges to have a Matthew McConaughey movie marathon, only it's none of the good McConaughey's. That's right, the brothers of Chi Beta were forced to watch How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,ù Failure to Launch,ù Ghosts of Girlfriends Pastù and Reign of Fire.ù Guys, nobody saw Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,ù it was 2009's Billionaire Boys Clubù (fuck you Kevin Spacey). How to Lose a Guy in 10 Daysù is actually a well done movie and I cry every time they get to the bridge scene.  Soon after, we were tipped off about certain suspicions regarding Kappa Kappa Kappa. There we witnessed something horrendous ¶ the Alexa Pledge.ù We saw a pledge of the house holding a speaker and being called Alexa by all of the sisters. When they yelled Alexa,ù they would request a song and the pledge would have to play it. The audacity of those women to make her their own personal robot. I mean, that's what we have robots for. God forbid they ask Alexa what the weather is; the poor pledge would have to put down her phone and look around. She put down her phone guys! We can't live without those! The worst hazing, however, came from Upsilon Chi Sigma Beta. This fraternity promises to make its pledges upstanding members of society and has a rigorous pledge process, lasting anywhere from two to eight years. The history of the fraternity is rigorous, and its president, no matter how fire he is, is nowhere to be found, ever. Where is the leadership of this large organization? Nowhere ¶ Daddy wasn't there. Unsurprisingly, a lot of pledges end up dropping around the fourth year of pledging, so it's very concerning that this fraternity still exists on this campus.  Sadly, I can no longer report on all these allegations. I put this on all of you to rise against the machine and end this psychotic trend of Alexas and McConaugheys.  † Brock Clark was watching How to Lose a Guy in 10 Daysù because it's a fucking great movie. Don't judge him you heathens.

Welcome to my first Sex with Stenchù article, a monthly sex advice column I'll be doing for Nexustentialism.  I've chosen watching porn as my first topic because I think it serves as a perfect transition from masturbating in the comfort of your parents' home to your tiny shared dorm room.  I know lots of you must be very scared right now because your moms aren't here to wash your semen-stained bed sheets, but have no fear! Once you're done reading this article you'll be a sure pro at watching porn and cleaning up after yourself.  Q: What is the correct way to watch porn? ì Lily, 17  A: Fully clothed and drenched in holy water.  Q: Is porn feminist? ì Sophie, 18 A: It depends. The only time porn is feminist is when the woman actually orgasms.  Q: How do I watch porn when I only like very loud porn? ì Andy, 18  A: This is hard, Andy. Very hard. There are no efficient solutions here other than to play your porn loud and proud. Eventually your roommates will get used to it and maybe even join you!  Q: Can I watch porn with a Tinder hookup? ì Sam, 19 † A: The answer is yes. When my Netflix subscription expired, my Tinder hookup and I had nothing else to do except watch porn. However, I must say that porn-watching with a partner makes it more about the plot than the actual coitus or fellatio, so don't say I didn't tell you so when you two start discussing casting and wardrobe choices.  Q: Can I watch it openly at a lecture hall? ì Kyra, 17  A: Only if you're sitting on the first row without headphones.  Q: Where do I find the college sex parties like the ones I see in porn? ì Alex, 19 A: If you illegally Bird or Lime onto campus, you will come across a place called the University Center (UCen for short). Wait until dark and linger around the first floor public restrooms.  Q: Do I wait to have sex until I've seen all the porn? ì Danny, 18 A: YES. Thank you for asking. You must indeed watch all the porn (yes, including hentai!) to have sex. If you don't abide by these rules, your partner will know that you once had an orgasm to Airbud: Seventh Inning Fetchù (2002).  Q: Do I wait to have my floor orgy until June? ì Mia, 19  A: The same way you always wait until Week 9 to hook up with your lab partner: yes. † Q: Are there really horny singles in my area? ì John, 18 A: No. Since Santa Barbara is the third-best UC, all students must always study to maintain that status. There are no horny singles in your area because they are all studying.  Q: Is it wrong to use my roommate's lube? ì Sarah, 18 A: Never. In fact, they secretly love it when they know your dirty hands have been on the same place as their dirty hands.  Q: Can my penis really grow five inches using this nifty trick? ì Davis, 32  A: YES. With just four easy installments of $49.99, you can easily grow your peen until your partner begs you to reverse it.  I hope you found this useful, Gauchos! Leave your questions or suggestions for what my next topic should be down below.  † Diana Prince is a certified top and a reluctant bottom.

In an email sent out to the student body early Tuesday morning, Chancellor Henry T. Yang stated that bikes succ lol, birds r cool now.ù  UCSB plans to impound all of the bikes on campus, regardless of who they belong to. HOPR bikes will be sent back to the manufacturer, and the university will be undergoing massive amounts of construction in anticipation of the influx of Bird scooters that are going to hit the university. † We plan to make the bike paths smaller and smoother so that the scooters can make zoom zoom faster,ù Yang said in his email.  The UCSB student population has never been more ecstatic.  Birds are in every way superior to bicycles, and it's about time UCSB recognizes that,ù Chad Jarvis Johnson, second year comparative literature major, said. The SBMTD is also going to be eliminated with the arrival of these new Bird paths. With the ease and simplicity of Birds, there is no need for our public bus system anymore. Birds are more efficient, there are no lines and you don't need a sticker or access card to use it.  They are, in every way, the finer mode of transportation,ù an SBMTD spokesperson said.  The new Bird paths are estimated to be completed by Fall 2021. New features of the Bird paths include higher slopes for more fun, decreased traffic in the lanes and the complete elimination of the sidewalk so that the student body will have to rely on Birds to get to and from classes.  † Christina Muoio promises she will write about something other than Birds next quarter.

We here at Nexustentialism know how difficult it can be to get some good gifts for your friends and family here at UCSB, so we thought we'd do you a solid and tell you what we really want. Stock those stuffings, roast those chestnuts and make some gluten-free cookies, cause it's showtime:  1. A Dad Hat  Dad hats are great. Whether it's for your best friend or your actual dad, nobody is gonna turn down this downgraded trucker hat if it shows up under that tree. The dad hat is versatile, unique-ish and comes in a variety of styles and designs. I personally want a dad hat with a raccoon on it to remember what my spirit animal is. Pro tip: Dad hats are especially great gifts if you want someone to know who your daddy is; nobody is gonna mess with your manz.  2. A Reliable Adderall Dealer  Finals are here and the gift that does not keep on giving is our brains. Let's get real guys, we're way too exhausted to even give a shit about a YouTube video, let alone an in-depth lecture on bioengineering. The part that sucks the most is that Adderall can fix all your problems, but too bad it's more difficult to find than the cure for blindness. Let's get real, doctors are getting smarter and they're picking up on the fact that not all of us can have ADHD. The gift to really give your loved one this holiday season is a reliable, well adjusted drug hook-up. If they have any other kinds of drugs, that's a bonus.  3. One of Those Sexual Awakenings People Keep Talking About It's amazing to think to that this is supposed to be the time of sexual awakening in college and I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to get a good night blumpkin when my roommate is a hermit? FOR THE LAST TIME DAVE, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE SOME OF YOUR CHIPS¶ but thank you for the offer. Seriously, all I want for Christmas is to end my year and a half dry spell, so if somebody could get me that I'd love you forever. I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants this for Christmas.  4. Hope  Finals are nigh. Our morale is broken and we are at a loss. This one is the most difficult to attain on this list¶ actually that might be the next one but we'll get to that. If you have any clue on how to get hope please clue us in because I've been crying in the corner of my room all week waiting for the impending doom that is my GPA. Bottom line, give us hope. Looking at you Obama, #ComeBackBarack. 5. Avocados WHERE ARE THE AVOCADOS? I GO TO FREEBIRDS, CAJUN KITCHEN, COSTCO AND THEY ARE GONE!? I AM GOING TO OVERTURN THIS TOWN AND RUN RAMPANT THROUGH THE STREETS IF THERE ARE NO AVOCADOS BY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK! I WILL SACRIFICE A RACCOON IF I HAVE TO AND YOU ALL KNOW I LOVE THOSE LITTLE FURRY DEMONS OF THE RECYCLING CAN! 6. An 8-Ball  I don't know why people want these so much? I mean I got one as a kid but I guess they're †back in style? All I here about is my friends wanting 8-Balls and I just wonder if they mean for pool or the magic kind? † All Brock Clark really wants for Christmas is to get some sleep.

It isn't our fault that these women don't have bladder control and can't just hold their blood until they find a toilet,ù an anonymous user (who clearly missed a very important health class lesson) commented.  What's next??? Free marijuana and bottles of booze in every dorm room?????ù wrote another incognito moron who thinks that feminine hygiene products are really equivalent to drugs and alcohol.  The true misogynistic colors of this stellar group of Facebook trolls really shined through in this exemplary comment section; yet for some reason all of these uterus crusaders chose to remain anonymous. It's almost as though they know how mortified their wives, mothers, daughters and female friends would be to know they actually think these things.  Why are my tax dollars going towards this abomination? You women are just snowflakes looking for sympathy! My wife is 68 years old and never asks me to pay for her tampons,ù noted another nameless user who failed to read past the headline to discover that residence fees pay for the free menstrual products. † What the Period Police failed to consider in their comment section war with the radical left,ù is that period products (not to mention products that manage period pain) are really fucking expensive. A woman can spend anywhere between $400-$2,000+ on period products alone in her lifetime, thanks in part to the fact that most states tax them as luxury goods (as if painful vaginal bleeding is a luxury, let alone optional). And let's be honest, most college students aren't exactly made of money.  When asked if they also had an issue with the free condoms in residence hall bathrooms too, the comment section became uncharacteristically quiet.  † Hannah Jackson isn't too happy that her taxes cover the Viagra you need for your limp dick, buddy.

Sometimes it's so bad I just stop walking and wait for them to pass.ù  Reports are coming in indicating that men are starting to take precautions to combat this national emergency. Some of the most popular steps for safety thus far include forming human busses that leave for common destinations every 15 minutes and just plain staying in your room and never coming back out.  I just can't take it anymore,ù first-year Max Johnston proclaimed. Girls are fucking scary man, I can't just go outside without feeling like they're tearing apart my outfit and making fun of me just outside of earshot. And what the hell are they always giggling about?ù Because this is a fairly unreported phenomenon, not much is yet known about the immediate dangers of the situation, if there are any. Pressure is rising for the university to set up a hotline and support groups for fragile men. An empirical study is currently underway by the sociology department to discover the full scope of this issue.  † Johnny Jets thinks men's rights are as legitimate as Scientology and big dick pills.

Know your facts and do your research before you make bold claims about topics that you don't do research on. You want to ban people from your campus that disagree with you, yet people who destroy myths about the gender pay gap are the problem. Read what section of the paper this is in. But that is part of the problem. Why is it satirical that men should be scared of women walking along behind them? The power of a woman to be able to attack a man, then immediately call for help as though he is the attacker, is huge and not to be underestimated.
òScared' might be taking it too far, just as women should not be typically scared of a man, but a man certainly should be cautious of a strange woman behind him. As a man, I am about as concerned of being attacked and immediately framed by a woman as I am being suddenly impaled by a unicorn. This is important ^^ 7% of men are responsible for over 90% of all sex crimes, and more than half of those 7% are repeat offenders. I hardly think less than 1/10th of a population constitute a rape cultureù among that general population. But no, keep pushing the narrative that men as a whole are sadistic sex predators because that's what the radical college leftists want to believe.

The college estimates the loss to be about $10,000. Finally, after days of silence, UCSB has released a statement addressing the crime. The university's Department of Lesser Important Crimes announced, There is no way this is possible.ù Elaborating further, the department went on to say, UCSB would never give a department that's not explicitly S.T.E.M. as much as 10,000 dollars.ù Students of the college have begun developing their own theories as to what actually happened.  While there are many who believe that the burglary actually happened, there are also many who believe the whole situation is a hoax. There are multiple students coming forward claiming that the burglary was an inside job.  A member of the CCS staff, who prefers to remain anonymous, came to the Nexus to share their side of the story. The rumors are true,ù the source proclaimed, it was an inside job.ù The source went on to describe how the department faked the burglary just for the money. They wanted to replace their 1995 Dell computers with nicer 2005 Dell computers.ù CCS has not released a follow-up statement, but the investigation is continuing on as normal. The Department of Lesser Important Crimes noted that the investigation was going slower than planned, though, because everyone they tried to interview from the department was, so weird.ù † Ollie Tabooger didn't do it!

daily-stench,How To Lose a Frat Guy in 10 Days,11-Jan-19,4:20 AM,['Chad Simpleton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-11/how-to-lose-a-frat-guy-in-10-days/,"Ollie Tabooger / Daily Nexus Frat guys are great ¶ OK, maybe some of them are î jury's out on the rest. Maybe you get lucky and actually find a decent guy with letters who treats you right, or maybe you don't. Have you ever considered what would happen if you end up with a Chad, Brad, Preston or male named Taylor? God forbid you end up with a male Taylor; those ones are the worst. Who would ever name their son Taylor? It just sets them up for failure and endless ridicule by both sexes. In any circumstance, you can't always be on your A-game, and you could find yourself waking up next to a sick boi like any of these, so here are the five ways to lose a frat guy in 10 days, just like Kate Hudson did to Matthew McConaughey. Days 1 & 2: Tell Him His Grammar Sucks  It's a known fact that frat bois like to spew out some gibberish that makes it seem like they're Darwin's missing link. Ranging from brahù to the occasional pin-headed shout that mimics a whale in labor, these guys just can't get their act or acapella right. If you call your brah out on this, he'll likely sink back into that turtle shell of a stringer and never come out of it. This is the perfect opportunity for you to walk out with your head held high, kiss your fist and touch the sky (bonus points if you don't take a shacker shirt; that kind of defeats the purpose ¶ porpoise? Kinda stuck on the whale thing).  Days 3 & 4: Call Him Out on His Gainsù Speaking of stringers, have you ever noticed that when a frat boi isn't sounding like a defective train whistle he's going to the gym to get some max gainsù? Here's what you gotta do to get out of the Taylor-Zone: Tell him he is a smol boi.ù That's right, nothing hurts a house bro's ego like finding out he isn't maximizing his potential and putting on at least three Chads' worth of girth on them arms. Point this out to him and he'll likely start watching a playlist on how to max those reps and hit those meal preps.  Days 5 & 6: Refuse the Juul The Juul is a sacred tradition; if you turn it down, you are not welcomed back ever. FOR-EH-VER. Just like in Sandlot.ù  Days 7 & 8: Bring Up the Fact That You Hate Patagonia It's a near guarantee that every Brad or Chad has at least one sweater from that company (we aren't gonna talk about Taylor again). I don't care if that sweater is softer than a pacifist's spine; you have to turn it down and make a scene out of it. The minute you put it on, you're locked in and you're basically house mom. If you really want to break that boy's spirit and end things for good, tell him that ultra-light yet indescribably soothing, handmade chest hammock is uglier than the picture on your driver's license. He'll understand î all of our ID photos suck, and I still look like I belong to Serial Killers Anonymous in mine.  Days 9 & 10: The McConaughey  It's the final countdown î none of the other methods have worked, and we have a Stage 5 Clinger ¶ looks like we need to do The McConaughey. What is The McConaughey, you ask? The McConaughey is an advanced method in which you must choose one of the characters from a Matthew McConaughey movie and embody that character until your pseudo-manz gets fed up enough and leaves you. You can't break character whatsoever, for doing so will give the manz hope. The best character to do is Steve Edison from The Wedding Planner,ù because he kinda looked like a dork with those frosted tips. Worst character to do is Tripp from Failure to Launchù because he's endearing like a golden retriever with only three legs, and that just won't help anyone.  † Chad Simpleton had The McConaughey done on him once, but it didn't work and now he's engaged to Rustin Cohle from True Detective,ù which is unhealthy and alarming.

I am basically keeping the appearance of our sorority at an all time high. Guys have like literally told me they slept with my sorority sisters because I gave the house a good name.  The other thing I am going to set straight is that I did NOT get kicked outù for punching a girl in the face and committing the horrendous crime of wearing army pants and flip-flops. I like maybe pushed her slightly (only because she fucking deserved it), and she was the one going against the sorority by-laws: Thou shalt not commit a fashion faux pas; unless it is for a fraternity social  and even then it must be a slutty version.ù  Her army pants and flip-flops totally go against that, and I was just doing my executive job of making sure the girls keep in line with the by-laws!!!

Current rifts in Senate prompted the Associated Students (A.S.) Internal Vice President (IVP) Steven Ho to put on this event in order to clear the airù and stop all the public bickering.ù Ho was inspired to put on the event after a late night showing of Creed II.  According to Ho, the classic outlets for A.S. feuds have not been sufficient for this year's political quagmire and thus students need to up the ante. He brought up the idea with several other students in Associated Students, who agreed that something must be done since the issues of A.S. are only metastasizing into more trouble. This evening of sport will include divisions that span across all levels of A.S. Bouts will include Boards, Commissions and Units (BCU) chairs, Senate members, A.S. Fellows and career staff.  One unnamed source stated that his bout will be live stream-worthyù and suggested that you should place your bets now.ù Special fight categories will include IVP versus Judicial Affairs and all of Campus United vs. Brooke Kopel.

Teene's 21st birthday was over the past winter break. At first, I starting charging my friends a $3 delivery fee as a joke, but they coughed up the money immediately,ù Teene said. As soon as I realized how desperate these people are to get their fix, I knew I had a chance to make a quick buck and raised the price to five dollars.ù Teene's financial success has been so rampant that he was recently included in the 2019 edition of the Forbes 30 Under 30ù list, placing six spots ahead of the current Goldman Sachs vice president. According to financial records posted on Teene's company website, quickpods.com, Teene made about $115,000 in the first two weeks of January †î a concerning number given that his customers go through an average of 10.2 pods per week. The key to my success is to never be busy,ù Teene said. If I'm in class or doing some other worthless activity, customers will start asking random fourth-year students on the streets once they get desperate enough. I pride myself on being fast, professional and reliable. I even chip in my own money for transportation to increase efficiency.ù  A further analysis of the delivery process showed Teene was referring to the $1 Bird scooter charge and not a car. Despite his success, Teene's friends don't seem to be too excited for the budding entrepreneur. Oh, fuck that kid, he's such a little shit,ù Richard Fiend, Teene's best friend and first customer, said. Like, I'm still going to buy from him, but he's so lucky he's the first one to hit 21. I would never do this to my friends. His buy six, get one 10 percent off deal was clutch, though.ù While business seems to be booming, some have questioned Teene's business model, expressing concern over the fact that many of his current customers turn 21 in the next few months. Oh shit, I didn't even think of that,ù Teene said.  † Kian Karamdashti's own Juul pod delivery service is still in development.

There is nothing I love more than standing with 30 other soundless, sullen, off-campus students while we wait for the 28 or what have you, once it comes pouncing on it like a Calpirg tabler on a airpodless victim.  There's no high like the feeling of pushing past other Gauchos in what is a silent but competitive pursuit of actually getting on the bus. It's better than any coke you'd find in any DP bathroom, that's for sure. Sometimes if you're really lucky, you get one of those standing-up spots, and the bus ride becomes a battle between bus and physical ability. I find that the wide, sudden turns really help keep my knees loose, and the speed bumps do wonders for my reflexes. Inevitably on the journey, one Gaucho can't take the physical extremes and falls onto their brethren, after which a moment of silence is always held. I respect that the bus can pick out the weak like that.  The bus is also a great time to get out of your box and explore new sights and smells. For instance, the mix of open Panda Express and a loose plate of Woodstock's pizza has actually made me more culinarily aware, and I deeply appreciate those thoughtful enough to take such knowingly pungent dishes onto the bus for all to smell.  Likewise, I have learned so much about my peers on my bus rides, which have really become more of a meditation for me. When people have loud, open phone calls in the confines of the silent bus, I feel honored that they chose to share such personal information with me. For instance, yesterday, a girl on the phone with her friend told the whole bus that she ate a chicken so spicy that she burped and threw up something purple. And I will never forget when a guy who got off at Camino Pescadero told his mom via Facetime that she should stop sending him the creams because he'd pretty much fixed it already.ù Long story short, the bus is just as fun as I thought it would be, and honestly, I feel like a much more cognizant, reflective individual now that I'm it's grateful passenger. There's honestly nothing I would change about the bus, not its always-warm seats, the guy blasting Humbleù through his Beats or the bus driver yelling at the kid who's holding up the line. Bus, baby, never change.  † Emma Demorest is a second year writing and literature major who would ride her bike to school if it just wasn't so hard.

Margaret Paige Claire Allen, first year pre-med major, has been reported by multiple students to Associated Students (A.S.) Judicial Affairs for being a class-know-it-all. While UCSB prides itself on now being the number five top public university, this girl has taken her public knowledge a bit too far. After only being at UCSB for one and a half quarters, Allen believes herself to be completely educated in both biology, chemistry and even filmmaking (FAMST 46 is basically a Master's class). Her fellow classmates have been lining up outside of the Judicial Affairs office in droves to complain about her social misconduct. You can't just speak up in a class of 800 students and make a point the professor JUST said but in other words,ù Chem 1B classmate Angela Waters told one reporter while standing in line. Her best friend bobbed her head in agreement, shaking her hands in rage. At least you don't have her in section! It's like every time the teacher remotely poses a question, her hand shoots up into the air,ù Water's friend added.  These student activists are petitioning the board to allow Allen to only be able to speak once per section and ask zero questions in lecture unless it is of utmost importance. What is considered to be important will be judged by both the professors and the board, not Allen. Professors are willing to work with the board and a few of her professors were even standing in line with the students. Allen refused to comment on the uprising against her but her Twitter is filled with subtweets about her overflowing knowledge, as well as †articles about the social exclusion children with high IQs feel.  † Mia Roncati was inspired by one particular know-it-all who needs to take a breather.

Last we spoke, I was getting ready for some winter frat rushes and î big spoiler alert î I crushed it and was too cool for every single house. Literally nobody could handle Bad Chad. I'm putting my talents somewhere else now, and I'm offering life advice just like Tony Robbins and my Uncle Ted. I had some peeps peep the DMs, so let's give òem a shoutout and help. 1. Why can't I get into the frat parties? î Sarah W.  Well Sarah, seeing as I am the resident fraternity expert, I can tell you that you probably didn't wear the right outfit for the party's theme. Nobody wants to see a cute librarian at the Rave Daughters and Disappointed Fathers Late Night. Takes you from a seven to a five, and we all know that just won't cut it, even at the bottom houses. NEXT! 2. Should I live in I.V. next year or stay in San Joaquin? î Bart A.  Well Bartholomew, do you like adventure? Can you see yourself waking up at 9 a.m. on a Saturday to start a pregame? Do you long to blast only throwbacks and house music until the noise ordinance says, Stop,ù and then continue anyways? If you answered yes to any of these, ditch the amenities of good ol San Jokingly Far Awayù Joaquin and make jump on the I.V. Bandwagon. This place is literally Westworld: Every night we destroy ourselves through vanity and promiscuity and then awaken the next day with everything back to normal, only to start the loop again. It's the best vacation you will ever have.  3. How do I void solicitors at The Arbor? î Shelby B. Have you tried headphones gorl? Probably a good place to start. Even the AirPod peeps figured this one out, and that's not saying much. Thank you, next.  4. How do I get rid of whiskey dick? î Richard L.  Well Dicky, the best trick for you is gonna be to lay off the Jameson. You can still totally drink, but I would suggest some Vitali or maybe even some Franzia. Whiskey dick can't happen if you don't actually drink whiskey.  5. What if she's just not that into me? î Tiffany B. Tiff, this one is tough. The best advice I can give is to let her go and be happy. If she actually wanted to be with you, she likely would have actually reciprocated a text message or said yes to going on that date. We've all been here, and it is so heartbreaking. The best thing you can do for yourself is recognize your own self worth and admit to yourself that this idealization of your crush is more a fixation than the tender blooming rose petals that gingerly spell love across the marital bed on the night of that honeymoon you are fantasizing about. Love yourself for a change and find some self worth. Also maybe get a Tinder. † Chad Simpleton is finding his own self-value and is ready to help people day and night if that's alright.

Just as Rogers had finished laying out her earth-toned Mexican blanket from World Market, she came to the daunting realization that her phone had died. † I would have worn shoes if I knew this was going to happen,ù Rogers exasperated. What's the point of being barefoot if people can't see how chill and down to earth I am?ù  Friend and avid weekend sunset goer, Natasha Sultana, attempted to salvage the disaster by offering to use her overpriced disposable camera. However, the gesture seemed to only upset Rogers further, for she was reminded that she would be unable to apply her Huji filter. As golden hour disappeared right before their eyes, the girls were comforted by the fact that they at least had a bottle of Barefoot wine to sip on in between the awkward silences. † Although there was no camera present, the two resorted to their default setting by continuously rotating through various model poses. Surfer Timothee Boil described the event as both fascinating and disturbing. At first I thought I was missing out some big joke,ù explained the shredder. But then I realized that they had just been fake laughing for a solid 20 minutes.ù  Rogers plans to speak her truth to the UCSB Free & For Sale Facebook page that a charging station should be implemented at Sands. Isla Vista residents should be on the lookout for the trending hashtag #StandWithSands in the upcoming weeks.  † Carly Kay is a sunset lover who is looking forward to posting about how she can't believe it's winter in January.

Yet, there is a special kind of person who needs mentioning.  On infamous fourth, a well-groomed, meticulous people inhabit the massive square tables and badly cushioned chairs that have probably been farted in millions of times. The people of fourth are not scholars; they are a simple folk who look to simple pleasures î a cold Yerb, a sticker-decorated Hydro Flask, a charged set of AirPods. More than anything, though, the people of fourth all just wanna fuck each other so badly î and they probably should already.  Upon emerging onto fourth, one finds the oozing sexual energy to be as thick as the Sourin smoke that permeates the rows of library books that haven't been opened in over one hundred years. The amorous beings of fourth love to dress like they don't care in a way that says they very much actually do. If you don't come in your quasi-best, a look best described as sexy-lazy chicù or frat boy dressed for Sundayù without a messy bun or clean brotherhood tee, then you should really get the hell out of there right now, you ugly loser.  On fourth, when a single person rises to stand, everyone stares at them with the intensity of a million suns, and one can't help but wonder if they're doing so because they want to fuck them, murder them, or both. A large part of time spent on the fourth floor is not spent studying; instead, the people of fourth would much rather make sultry eye contact with whomever, whenever, as much as humanly possible. People might as well say, I will never ever speak to you or acknowledge you other than this kind of sexual look I'm giving you,ù because truly that's what's going on. Furthermore, the eye contact can either be interpreted as, Lets bang this very moment,ù or, I know your darkest secret and you should be ashamed, you pervert.ù  No one is certain what this really means since no one from fourth floor has yet to push all laptops and open notebooks off the table in the heat of passion and really go to town (which we at Nexustentialism highly suggest they do) because the cumulative sexual tension makes us nervous.  † Sam Penn is a third-year econ major who wouldn't fuck anyone on the fourth floor and thinks they all need to know this and need to be humbled by it.

According to a now-closed Facebook event, Beta Beta Beta's (BBB) recent dayger promised a lavish party at an oceanside DP address with promised Grey Goose, Hennessy, Champagne, Supreme money guns and one-hundred percent guaranteed sex for all partygoers.ù The dayger's advertising also featured a promotional video filmed at Sands Beach with scantily-clad models rolling around in the oil-caked sand. Promised special guests included LaVar Ball, Chancellor Yang and the Elote man as well as headliners Soulja Boy, MattyBRaps and Bobby Brackins.  With such a star-studded lineup, tickets were sold at $150 a pop, around 145 more dollars than the average weekend Isla Vista dayger. Although the price presented was steep, Instagram posts sponsored by Chancellor Yang from the @ucsantabarbara account provided such buzz around the event that it sold out in minutes. We promised him that we would stop calling him Daddy in the meme page,ù said one brave anonymous Beta Beta Beta pledge. That was the first lie we told, and from there I realized this was all one big scam. I'm pretty sure the only artist we could get to come was Bobby Brackins.ù Dayger-goers first realized something was amiss when they arrived to the 66 DP block address and found multiple pledges redirecting them on Birds to another address on the 68 Fortuna block. Once there, the 500 or so ticket buyers were met with only two handles of Vitali and three racks of Rolling Rock beer, considerably less than the much-publicized fountain of booze they were promised. To add insult to injury, music was provided with a pledge playing music off his very own iPhone 4S. I don't even have Spotify Premium,ù said the anonymous Beta Beta Beta pledge on the aux cord. Every song on the U.S top 50 list was on shuffle.ù Eyewitness accounts report the party went only downhill from there, as Snapchat videos show pledges frantically lining up Dixie cups, designating pee corners and hastily getting chase. In one grainy video, it even appears rapper Ja Rule was there ordering fraternity brothers around.  Ja Rule's representatives refused to confirm or deny Ja Rule's involvement with the dayger. One memorable scene in Netflix's FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happenedù includes a Fyre Festival staff member recalling being asked to complete oral sex in order to obtain clean water for the event. A similar event seemed to unfold at the dayger. My big told me if I don't go down to Isla Vista Market and get chase, I was gonna get dropped,ù said our anonymous source. So I swished some mouthwash, put on my rainbows and Birded over fully prepared to suck dick in order to get two bottles of Minute Maid chase for the dayger. Luckily the staff felt so bad for me they let me take it for free.ù As the realization of the dire dayger set in, many partygoers attempted to leave, only to realize that not only Beta Beta Beta was refusing to fund their Birds back into central Isla Vista, but that there were simply not enough Birds to transport a group of (mostly sober) people home.  Without any alcohol in me, there was no way I could face the sober walk back to my place,ù said a party attendee. We were basically stranded so far from the rest of Isla Vista civilization. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.ù The dayger of a lifetimeù ended shortly after at 4:29 p.m. after the family that actually lived at the Fortuna residence found 500 people in their backyard and called the police. Damn it,ù said one very unhappy attendee leaving the party. I was really banking on that guaranteed sex.ù † Billy Mcfartland would like to inform you will most likely think what the fuckù to this article if you haven't watched the documentaries.

Despite similar occurrences in the past, this particular lunar eclipse had an unforeseen effect on Isla Vista, and its consequences were disastrous. Intensive scientific research has proven that certain activities can synchronize menstrual cycles among females, such as watching Sex in the Cityù together, simultaneously devouring aphrodisiacs or even something as kinky as having their dogs shit in the same I.V. park. Our recent super blood moon produced a wide-scale period synchronization, the likes of which have never been seen before. Oddly enough, the group sync was only experienced by UCSB sorority members. This was the worst possible outcome. The beginning stages offered little more than sporadic angry texts to friends and ex-friends, coupled with a handful of realizations regarding tampon shortage. Yet as the eclipse neared its peak, so too did the radical events.  Twitter suffered mass shutdowns ranging along the Central California coastline due to an absolute cacophony of subtweets and spamming of hashtags that included the entirety of the greek alphabet,ù according to a tweet by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Jan. 21. WebMD suffered similar server overloads, as they recorded a slew of online questions and calls regarding possible Advil overdoses and uncertain menstrual symptoms.  At peak hour, two riots were reported by the CSOs and onlooking Isla Vista residents at both Starbucks and Caje. Both establishments were forced to shut their doors early due to unmanageable customer behavior that sparked confrontations at both counters and at Starbucks' recently established mobile order window. Follow-up investigation by the Isla Vista Foot Patrol reported a rampant painting of Isla Vista with both coffee and big-little craft supplies centered around these two locations,ù according to IVFP Officer Junia Malares.  Due to quick-spreading I.V. gossip and ever-loudening†sorority sisterhood chants, locations such as Keg N Bottle and Isla Vista Market were able to close before mobs approached to oceanside Isla Vista and suffered minimal damage. A cashier and taquito cooker, who prefers to remain anonymous, commented on the little he saw from the windows of 7-Eleven before fleeing: ¶some matching tees? Stained jorts? I didn't stay long, that shit was wack as fuck.ù † Grant McDonald is double majoring in astrology and gynecology through UCSB's extended research program.

Tree, 147 years old, was booked on charges of exposure of roots, disturbing the peace, possession of a deadly branch and leafing the scene of the crime. Officer Pake Jeralta was at the scene when the incident that occurred and defended the officers' decision At first, I didn't think anything when the tree hit the building,ù recalled Officer Jeralta. But when Jeralta noticed the tree was laying on the curb he was legally obligated to arrest it. What precedent does that set to our impressionable community if we let that tree sit on the curb? Huh?ù Officer Jeralta cried. Soon Becky from Yo Gabba Gabba is going to be laying down on the corner of 65 block next Saturday night 'cause her feet are tired. It would be anarchy.ù Not only was the arrest itself put under question, but the way in which the suspect was arrested also created stirrings within various protest groups. We tried to breathalyze the suspect but the perpetrator was not responding to any orders,ù said Jeralta. At that point we had no point but to use aggressive force to restrain the suspect. So yes, a chainsaw was used to neutralize the threat the suspect provided in this specific situation.ù In the school week after the controversial arrest, students biking alongside Ocean Road could be met with increased construction activity disrupting the already heavily-filled two lanes of bike path on the route.  After interrogating our suspect, we discovered that Tree was involved with a number of criminal tree associates all along Ocean Road,ù said Officer Jeralta in a prepared statement. The only thing that remains of the Tree family. Ollie Tabooger / Daily Nexus This community of tall fucking trees provided a direct potential threat not only to the student community whose residences are in close proximity to the trees, but more importantly to the funds of the University if one of these students were to be hurt if struck by a falling tree ¶ It is with this realization that we carried out an operation to exterminate every last one of those trees until the threat was neutralized.ù This is a complete overreaction,ù said one anonymous biker on the way to class. The tree chipped a little bit of paint off the police station wall and now they closed the bike path and are just shredding away.ù  The anonymous biker was especially angered by the fact that they almost got hit by a car while trying to avoid the taped-off zone.  Why can't they just go back to the important stuff, like going undercover in front of International Market and arresting naked dudes on Birds?ù † Kian Karamdashti wants to protect the trees.†

Not much is known about the mystifying barefooted beings who dwell its streets, but nevertheless, rumors swirl about. We here at Nexustentialism went undercover to see if the rumors surrounding the mystery-shrouded residence that so few Isla Vistans choose to inhabit hold up to our concrete reporting skillz. So without further ado, we present 68 block, fact and fiction:  1. There is no electricity on 68  FACT. All residents of 68 block light their homes by viciously peddling their bikes hooked up to a generator to keep the lights on. How do you think they're all physically capable enough to live so far from campus? They've got quads of steel, baby. It may not be as comfortable as 65 living, but it's certainly cheaper.  2. All residents of 68 block are farmers FICTION. Look, try as they might, not every resident of 68 has the time to commit to farming time. Many of them are also hunter-gatherers. (Editor's note: 68 block residents can make a mean braised raccoon. Please see the On the Menu section for more details.)  3. The quality of men on 68 is much higher than the men on 65 FICTION. No need to elaborate there.  4. There are a ton of old people on 68 FACT. They are an absolute fucking riot at parties too. Nobody throws down like the people who have lived in I.V. since before you were even a glimmer in your mother's eye.  5. EDM is banned from 68 block FACT. Following the rise of Dubstep in the early 2010s, a block-wide ordinance was enacted banning all shitty music from entering the vicinity. If neighbors so much as even hear the faintest untz-untz of the trash you'd find in a frat house, they are legally obligated to call your landlord. Strike two and you're getting slapped with a fine.  6. Everyone on 68 has a rotating communal family dinner/orgy.  FACT. 68 houses take turns hosting large family-style dinners followed by insane no-holds-barred orgies.

daily-stench,The Four People You'll Date in College,14-Feb-19,4:20 AM,['Brock Clark'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/the-four-people-youll-date-in-college/,"Courtesy of Pxhere Relationships are tough. How tough? Tough to say. In I.V., they're tougher than a Hydro Flask that just won't break whenever it smacks into the ground mid-lecture. We can't just make out in cars like we did in high school, but we can't get married at 21 either ¶ Come on guys, don't leave the party after one shot. Here, hopefully, is the guide you need to understanding relationships. 1. Harry, Meet Sally It's a tried and true: When Harry Met Sallyù is the best damn romance film ever created. But the whole point of When Harry Met Sallyù is that they never got together for years even though they met in college. They were friends and they stayed friends until New Year's Eve. This is the longîterm long term. It could be your dorm mate, your upstairs neighbor, hell, it could even be the cute guy who makes your food at Santorini's. You don't know when, how or where you will meet, but it's gonna be majestic as heck. Eventually, you guys will tell each other your feelings in a semi-drunken state at some elaborate party. Take it from this guy: This is the best way to go.  2. The Rebound Hound  This one sucks. A rebound hound is essentially the guy or girl who always goes for or gets thrown at the new sexy singles waiting in their local area. This person is never in a relationship for long. They are the stepping stone î the guru if you will î who guides the heart-broken and lustfully lonely into the next phase of their dating lives. These men and women are the heroes without capes, they are the Jim Halperts before being with Pam Beesly (but also not when he was with Karen because, let's be honest, who actually appreciated Rashida Jones in The Office;ù she was just sort of there). These men and women are all around, and you will never know it. They are the lays we deserve, but not the ones we need. Shoutout Jim.  3. When Will My Wife/Husband Return from War  The Long Distance. We all know someone who is engaged in endlessly long phone calls to their significant other who is either a) at another school, b) in the military, c) running a multi-billion dollar company or d) living at home and figuring themselves out.ù This relationship is characterized by the fact that the partner here will sneak in something about their S.O. during most conversations. The best advice I can give to the long distance is make sure you actually bring the person around every once in a while so we can make sure that a) they're treating you right and b) they're real.  4. Listens to Father John Misty Alone in His/Her Room for Hours on End Being single: We've all been there, but this poor individual relishes in it. When entering this person's room, you will see many a poster from a ò90s indie film, and their bluetooth speaker will be blasting anything from Hollywood Cemetery Foreverù to Bored in the U.S.A.,ù (which there is usually nothing wrong with). Here, the person will likely be sullen, making references every minute to some hook-up they've had or some love they've lost ¶ just to remind you of their single-ness. Don't be this person. Nobody likes them. † Brock Clark is not a certified relationship expert but will be opening a business for relationship coinciding in the foreseeable future.

The year was 2016. I finally had a boyfriend, Leo was about to win his first Oscar, Taylor and Kanye were feuding publicly again. Everyone was having a grand old time. After a sweet little date downtown, my guy and I went back to my place where he gave me a stuffed unicorn, the universal code for, Let's have sex.ù All he had to do was pull the Trojan value-pack out of his Dakine backpack and I was all his, my latex allergy forgotten.  Cherry ready to be popped, I embraced the unbearable pain that overtook my entire body, letting him know just how horribly good it felt with my sexiest screams and even crying so that at least some part of me was wet. Like a true gentlemen, his little soldier couldn't stay hard once he realized I'd spent the last 20 minutes in agony, so he reverted to cuddling me in his loving, skinny arms. Even now I'm turned on by the feeling of his skin against mine while I broke out into a cold sweat.  It was so sweet watching the poor kid struggle to find words, shocked at the destructive power of his formerly innocent penis. Eventually he pulled on his jeans and took his leave, like an angel ascending back to heaven in acid-wash bootcut Levi's. Ripe with anticipation, I limped bow-legged to the bathroom for an assessment of my new womanhood.  My vagina had turned the most beautiful shade of eggplant with lips more swollen than Kylie Jenner's. My euphoria must have been too extreme, sending my heart-rate skyrocketing and blurring my vision with the brightest stars. I could feel Cupid's precious little hands tightening around my chest until, overcome with joy, I blacked out.  An hour later I awoke naked and cold alone in the dark, immediately recalling the glorious transformation that led me there. Triumphant, I reached for my phone and, after about three tries to pick it up because I guess losing your virginity makes things a lot heavier, I called my sister and spilled the whole story right up to the fairy tale ending.  You're allergic to condoms, you fucking idiot.ù I could hear the pride in her voice. This sounds like anaphylaxis. You should go to a hospital.ù  No,ù I sighed and smiled to myself. Trust me. It's love.ù  † Melanie BanghƒÅrd is a sixth-year student majoring in human anatomy who writes amateur romance novels inspired by internet porn. 
Print This kind of stuff is why I want my tuition dollars back. I don't want to open the paper and see some girl's description of her promiscuous, immoral, and disgusting love life. If you're going to do something horrible like having sex with every guy who buys you a unicorn, do us all a favor and don't say anything. Please take this as a request from me to you î fix yourself up before going out into the world from college. The world isn't like this stuff you're doing at our college, thank goodness.

As houses on 66-block through 68-block have been making the slow progression of plunging into the ocean, the 65-block remains untouched by the ocean tides.  Sorority dues now not only pay for your friendships, but they pay for the stability of your oceanside satellite house foundation as well.  When asked to explain why she remains friends with the girls that she constantly complains about and slightly hates, one Pi Burger Fry fourth-year explained, They're bitches, but they're, like, my bitches, you know?ù  Who knew that the vapid recruitment conversations during the first week of Fall Quarter freshman year would yield a sisterhood so strong that it would provide not only the foundation for lifelong friendships, but that it would also provide the foundation for an entire block of barely-inhabitable shacks teetering on a cliff? I never thought I'd join a sorority, but now I literally cannot imagine my life without the girls in my chapter,ù said a girl that was only one iClicker vote away from getting knocked off the bid list.  These delusions about finding a home away from home lasted from the dorms to the chapter house and finally to the DP satellite houses where î despite the number of mediocre parties filled with passive-aggressive girls and headache-inducing house music that loosens the cliff with every beat drop î the sisterhoods are stronger than ever.  While no one is completely sure how the sisterhoods have managed to keep the 65-block foundations solid, science suggests it may have something to do with the cumulative weight of all of the repressed guilt from what they do when they're blacked out every night that compresses the eroding soil back into place. † Kylie Jemmer is a sorority expert and local social media influencer.†

He came home at like eight in the morning with this stupid grin on his face,ù said roommate Roger Cantpull. I made a joke about the walk of shame thinking there was no way he actually got laid, but then he kept going on and on about his sexual conquest.ù According to neighbors who were awoken by the loud bragging happening next door, Nomo could be heard yelling You know how I do!ù multiple times as The Lonely Island's (feat. Akon) I Just Had Sexù blasted over the speakers. They also claimed he mentioned only crying twice during the best two minutes and 27 seconds of his life.ù To be honest, that's a lot longer than I thought he would last. I'll definitely give him props there,ù †Cantpull said. While Nomo's housemates were originally happy for his valiant conquest, the jubilation soon turned into bitter resentment by early afternoon. I'm sitting here trying to play a game of FIFA, and this dude keeps yawning obnoxiously,ù said one of his housemates. Everytime I ignored him he would just stare at me and yawn even louder. When I finally acknowledged him, he went òSorry, did I yawn? I'm just super sleep deprived from last night.' Who does that?ù Here at Nexustentialism, we take our journalism very seriously, and we employed all our resources to thoroughly locate the female who dared have sexual relations with Nomo.

It was one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen,ù claimed the anonymous resident. I feel bad for the girl. It's Valentine's season, people get lonely and desperate. We've all been there. However, I hope I never sink to that level.ù So what's next for Nomo and his housemates? Apparently, Nomo's reign of terror is far from over. Oh man, he's out of control,ù said Cantpull. Today, he ate my lunch and, when I confronted him about it, he threw me against the wall and told me I have to do his homework now since he pulls and I don't.

Foot Patrol Officer or hooking up with any guy named Chad. † Of all the reckless blunders regularly making an appearance on this list, the acquisition of a lip tattoo may take the cake as the single most ill-conceived. Third-year anthropology major Becky Beckinsale's Barefoot Ros√©-induced bender last night culminated in a spur-of-the-moment lip tattoo as well as shame on her family. All I can remember is stumbling along the arrows leading into Precious Slut. The rest is just a blur,ù Becky recalled. †She and two other friends purportedly decided on the phrases send it,ù bad bitch 4 lyfeù and i have daddy issues.ù While her friends (like most girls with lip lettering) seem to show no remorse, Becky has found herself wishing she had never gone through with it. †I keep imagining myself a couple years from now, graduated and in a professional setting, with the words òI have daddy issues' inked on the inside of my mouth. †How am I supposed to take myself seriously as a working woman?ù Becky said, holding back tears. Surveys have shown that 98 percent of young adults who receive these oral adornments do so under the impression that they will last no longer than a few months. †However recent reports have revealed that they can last up to five years in some cases. I literally can't even right now,ù Becky wailed, now ugly crying. There is one takeaway from Becky's harrowing tale: if you're going to get a lip tattoo, at least make it something cute, like a quote from the TV show Friendsù or something you saw on Cosmo's Snapchat story the other day. †You may be stuck with it for longer than you'd think. † Brian Byrne is a first year with an infinity symbol lip tattoo, representing his never-ending love for pizza rolls.

Therefore, I've compiled this list of places you can park in IV. You're welcome.  1. Park in any parking spot that you want.  Hey, you're already paying $36,000 to go to UCSB, and they're going to charge an extra $600 just to park your car? Fuck that shit. Park wherever you want! Who cares? We're all going to die anyway.  2. Park in front of the red curb.  Get back at all those officers who have ever given you a parking ticket at Pardall and park in front of the red curb. Better yet, park in front of the red curb in front of I.V. Foot Patrol. Can you say, Power move?ù  3. Take someone else's spot.  There's no bigger flex than parking in someone else's spot. Assert your dominance around your apartment complex and take that open spot. Take your landlord's spot, take your roommate's spot, take the neighbor's spot, who cares? You pay rent there too. And if someone publicly shames you on Free and For Sale, then congratulations, you've made it.  4.†Park in faculty parking.  You're the professor now.  5. Park in the ocean.  This is more of a last resort. If there's literally no where else to park, park in the ocean, and then sue UCSB for the water damage to your car.  Hope this was helpful, and I hope that a parking spot opens up soon so that I can move my car out of Sands. † Christina Muoio wants to Venmo charge UCSB for the gas she's used up trying to park in I.V.

Ortega's 76-foot-long mural, depicting a scene from Homer's Odyssey, is almost certainly the most cursed piece of artwork on campus. When reached out to for comment, one student, transfixed by the eldritch horror of the fresco, muttered, Œ∑ ŒøœÅŒ≥ŒÆ œÑœâŒΩ œŒ±ŒªŒπœéŒΩ Œ∏ŒµœéŒΩ Œ∏Œ± ŒµœŒπœÉœÑœÅŒ≠œàŒµŒπ.

Painted over the course of nearly four years in the late 1950s, The Odysseyù has been staring directly into the souls of diners for nearly 60 years. The mural depicts men in various grotesque stages of being transformed into swine î their skin melting off, bones contorting and all human essence draining from their bodies î all right above the make-your-own omelette station. Some even say the mural's true purpose may be to combat the freshman-15 with it's unappetizing nature. Howard Warshaw, the creator of the piece, said The Odysseyù was meant to serve as a reflection for students venturing on their own journeys from home, through college, and beyond.ù The UCSB administration declined to comment on whether human-swine transmutation was something that could be expected as part of the UCSB educational experience. Though we may never know what secrets lie within the depths of this mural's imagery, we do know there will be much more time for exorcisms and paranormal testing because the mural was painted for free under the condition it would remain displayed as long as the building stood. This mural might be keeping students slim until the Class of 3000, or at least until UCSB tears Ortega down and replaces it with a less shitty dining hall. † Max Myszkowski now knows way too much about Ortega.†

I know we were never dating, but I felt a connection to you unmatched to anything I've experienced in the past. Please know I still respect you, even though I feel you don't respect me. My loyalty lies with you, and if you ever have an opening for me I will take it because I am emotionally unwell. Anyways, I hope you have a great fucking life without me î but also, I love you.

A.S. passes only good plans that are very well thought through and everyone agrees on them! It is almost unbelievable how fast all of the projects A.S. proposes come to fruition! There are never any downsides to any of them, and this is why A.S. is so good to the people of UCSB!  Students at UCSB love A.S., the senator's office hours are always very, very full! People come from as far as 68 to pay tribute to the senate and its almighty president. In fact, during senate meetings, so many students are in attendance that they cannot fit into the building! The crowd drawn from these meetings was three times bigger than any crowd that there has ever been at UCSB! Office hours must be moved to Campbell Hall to accommodate the crowd, which is three times bigger than any crowd that there has ever been at UCSB!  During the last election students clamored to the polls in bunches! Records were broken. Big records! A.S. hasn't filled the EVPSA position because we don't want to! Not because we can't! We have had three elections because the people love them! There were more people who voted for EVPSA than for the NewCen! The only reason A.S. didn't get enough of votes is because students were so passionate about our causes that many voted twice! Spoiling the results! An unlucky result of such a blooming and interactive democracy! We have even seen many statistics of SBCC students illegally voting with fake UC access cards. We must build a wall to stop them from entering campus! A.S. has heard the complaints about how their members cannot stop breaking rules, and safe to say, they have had enough of it.

Though Sal's days left in the realm of the living may be numbered, he will definitely have to spend at least one of his few hours left on this Earth taking his Math 3B midterm exam. Sadly, this seems to often be the case, as all the professors in S.T.E.M. departments could not collectively scrape together one shit to give about their students. It's right there in the syllabus: no make-up exams, no exceptions. I don't know what else to say î other than go fuck yourself.ù Students suffering from diseases of all kinds have reported similar findings. From run-of-the-mill cases of Strep and Mono, to even the fabled UCSB Super-Chlamydia (a strain genetically engineered to perfection in the massive petri dish that is Isla Vista), ailing students were unable to get so much as a make-up quiz from their professors. One professor in the chemistry department allegedly signed off her email to an unwell student get well soon,ù despite clear indifference over whether the student lived or died. This professor was unable to be reached for further comment, as she was busy swimming in a Scrooge-McDuckian vault filled to the brim with textbook royalty money. Humanities professors, on the other hand, have reportedly allotted an extra three days to all of their students to complete their assignments in order to reduce student stressù and ease the burden on students' mental health.ù Local dance major Yvanna Shachit didn't happen to see the big deal with all of this, citing her professors' genuine care for how their students performed in their bullshit classes. Yeah, I was taking a mental health day on Friday, so I just texted my Dance 45 professor, and told them I wasn't feeling good vibrations that day and they let me reschedule the midterm for next week.ù Unfortunately, most professors teaching classes required for majors that actually lead to future employment opportunities do not seem to share this sentiment. In fact, for many maladies, it is not uncommon for practitioners in the Isla Vista area to pronounce a patient's GPA dead upon diagnosis. † Henri Bemis was sick last week. Could you tell?

Everyone there was wearing 90s dad jeans and gray Skechers. They were also carrying those diagonal backpacks that sling across your body,ù second-year math major Aimee Rodriguez said. Never have I nutted so hard!ù  The same happened to third-year English major Rick Ridden. This chick î the way her pants flared around her ankles and the boost her shoes added to her impatient stride! It made me wanna ask her out,ù Ridden said.  According to experts, the phenomenon of climaxing after seeing oversized jeans and bulky tennis shoes on engineers is normal.  It's been happening for years. [Engineers] can't help but exert this very heavy, heated, sexual energy that emits from the tatters of their jeans and the air holes of their Skechers,ù orgasm expert Jordan Mekooch said.  The history of engineers wearing visually repelling garb is a timeless action î one fueled by the need to downplay their already existent (and potent) sex appeal.  We need to do everything we can to look absolutely unwantable so it repels partners. If we were to dress like everyone else, our attraction would be too much for the normal masses î they would all just nut at the sight of us!ù Jeff Swallows, a spokesperson for the college, said.  Dressing like a divorced father who still uses an atlas is one of the core values of being an engineer, the UCSB College of Engineering formally established in 2002.

The breaking news flooded UCSB as soon as she first stirred, a sign of life so unexpected that it immediately captured the attention of the entire first floor which then, for the first time ever, actually got quiet. The vibrations of a hundred Airpods being pulled out at once could be felt all the way up to the eighth floor î or at least we assume so because everyone studying there complained about the mild disturbance.  Several Snapchat stories have recorded the precious moment she returned consciousness, capturing the alien-grizzly-bear-like moan as she stretched, and her first words: Woah, wicked nap. Fuck, where's my Walkman?ù  Shannon Snoozman, now a 28th-year student, considers herself lucky to be alive. I almost drowned in my own drool at one point,ù she recalls. Totally gnarly, but at least they fixed my back.ù She wears a specially designed brace to correct her spine after nearly three decades in the òfinals week slump' position.

Anyone visiting the mountain side first floor is likely familiar with unconscious egg chair occupants such as Hood Up Headphones In Guy, Chick Who Brought Her Own Blanket and the always thrilling Dude Who Somehow Is Mysteriously Missing One Shoe. Snoozman takes the title for most ridiculously long stint in an egg chair and, after briefly considering charging her monthly rent, Davidson Library has decided to honor her marathon sleep by featuring it in the next photo series display by the elevators that no one ever bothers to look at.  Wow,ù Snoozman muses, 2019, huh? So while I slept I racked up 27 years' worth of tuition. That's gotta be, like, at least $100,000. My mom's totally gonna flip.ù At the request of her doctors for fear it would cause a heart attack or immediate death, no one has explained to her that today $100,000 would only cover two text books and a Scantron.  Snoozman, eager to embrace the new millennium, had some questions of her own. Her inquiries centered mostly around the phenomena of iClickers and internet memes, which she now fervently desires to take a class on, but circled back to the enormous clusterfuck that is our current political climate.  I was part of so many women's rights and activist groups,ù she exclaims, still naive enough to not be dead inside. And we were accomplishing so much for modern feminism! I can't wait to find out how far equality in the country has come since then.ù  Unfortunately, our time came to an end at that point, upon Shannon learning of the current Presidency and attempting to throw herself out a window, but we expect to hear more from her and finish the interview just as soon as she stops crying.  † Jordan Curiel is patiently waiting for her turn to finally sit in a fucking egg chair.

These bribes helped otherwise unqualified children of wealthy business titans, Hollywood celebrities and other various rich motherfuckers to get into schools like USC, UCLA, Stanford and Yale, amongst others. † This scandal has been aptly dubbed Operation Varsity Blues, in which wealthy parents paid off college entrance exam administrators and coaches to secure their dumbass kids a spot in a university they would otherwise never earn.  In a news conference this morning, when addressing the complexities of the situation, FBI agent Brett McKassen was asked by a Daily Nexus reporter whether there was any evidence of parents trying to bribe UCSB officials. Hell no,ù McKassen said with a snort. Does UCSB have any D1 sports? Seriously, I couldn't name a single coach to bribe if I tried.ù  McKassen also noted that literally nobody gives a shit about UCSB's standing as No. 5 public university in the nation.  Listen, this No. 5 ranking is nice and all, but let's be honest: no one cares. These people aren't going to college to go to public school. Let alone the fifth-best public school,ù McKassen concluded. While it is very upsetting that UCSB can't be a part of this rockin' scandal, at least we can take solace in the fact that the university admits a ton of other totally unqualified people who ride the coattails of their parents' money and privilege through college! Shout out to the uber-wealthy out-of-state students with shit GPAs who get in solely to pay higher tuition and the Greek life members whose ability to pay exorbitant dues grants them access to all of the tests they'll ever need for the rest of undergrad.

Look up some facts before you shit on out of state students. In California, nearly every high school student applies to at least one of the UC's. Even if every single student that applies from one California High school is qualiified to go to UCSB, only a handful will get in because they simply can only let so many people in from one school or region.

Much like C.A.S.E., W.E.A.K. aims to implement a month-long training course for those involved in more than one bike-related accident.  Students fined and enrolled in W.E.A.K. are reportedly mandated to attend Sunday courses where, through various PowerPoints, they learn correct biking hand gestures and correct biker's etiquette. Additionally, those in the program are required to install training wheels on their bikes for the duration of the course.  Embarrassing? Not really, why would you say that?ù says W.E.A.K. sophomore Lewis Travolsky. At first, sure, I hated the training wheels more than anything, but I'm learning to appreciate the stability they provide. Plus, they force you to go slow, so it's become kind of meditative.ù  It should also be noted that participants are required to fasten a large, green reflective sign with W.E.A.K.ù spray painted across the surface. This, as told by UCPD, is said to reduce crashes and accidents during night biking, the most dangerous of all biking types.  Samira Sahan, a third-year, was mandated to attend the program after her fourth bike accident this year, one of which shattered both an iPhone and the pride of a particularly masculine baseball player involved.  Do I like the training wheels? No, no I don't. I'm just hoping there's a cool T-shirt at the end of this.ù Sahan stated.

If a student gets a cold, they will no longer be sent home with a plastic bag filled with a single cough drop, but rather a cloth sack filled with herbs, straw and spices to help ease malaise.

How was he able to curb his addiction to cocaine, you ask? We spoke with Clint in an exclusive interview. Here's what he had to say: So, like, I'm broke, and I hadn't had any blow all day. It's 11 p.m. and I'm like shit, okay, at least this horrible day will be over soon. I get paid tomorrow. And then it happens. I get a text from my buddy, and he's like òYo, did you do your geography assignment?' And I'm like holy shit, no, I didn't. So, I log into GauchoSpace and get started,ù Clint recounted. I see the deadline is 11:45, and then it happens. The rush. The moment of clarity. My hands start shaking even more than that one time I had six Yerbs. It was the most intense feeling, kind of like being on a Bird after one too many Four Lokos. I finish the assignment, my whole body is trembling. It's 11:44 with 28 seconds left. I click submit. I transcend the corporeal realm. I'm astral projecting. It was, like, insane, dude. I saw that I had a phil paper due the next night and I did the same thing. Feels amazing.

daily-stench,Campus Crisis: Storke Tower Goes Flaccid,4-Apr-19,4:20 AM,['Max Myszkowski'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/campus-crisis-storke-tower-goes-flaccid/,"Ollie Tabooger / Daily Nexus Eyewitnesses have reported that Storke Tower, the proud phallic symbol of UC Santa Barbara, has ì devastatingly ì gone flaccid. The 175-foot-tall tower, which was first erected in front of the University Center in 1969 (nice), may be a little tired, experiencing a bout of performance anxiety or might just not be in the mood right now. Speculations about what may have caused the once rock-hard monolith to go limp have already begun to circulate amongst the student body. The little guy is going on 50 years old; it's not uncommon for things like this to happen at that age,ù empathized one onlooker. Some well-meaning students have dedicated themselves to helping the tower get back up to its old, skyward-stretching self. Efforts have included the likes of sensual dances, virgin sacrifices and even a matchmaking attempt between Storke and the foxy little air traffic control tower of the nearby Santa Barbara airport. Sadly, these efforts have yet to arouse the landmark, and the rigidity of the tower has continued to steadily decline. The Nexus reached out to experts in the engineering department for comment on the structural integrity of the rapidly deflating campanile but were met with blank expressions as they had never seen anything of this sort and didn't know enough about romancing to produce a solution. They did, however, mention that without the Tower's phallic stature radiating sexual vibes across campus like radio waves, UCSB's hotness ranking was dropping by the second. Some students, however, have embraced the Tower's new, flaccid state, citing beliefs that the Tower shouldn't be held to a higher standard than anyone else. Supporters have even gathered under the tower to protect its right to relax for once, calling for more realistic expectations of our architecture. Sporting signs claiming soft is the new sexy,ù these individuals urge us to accept and love our campus phallus unconditionally. Hell, I spend most of the day flaccid. It's only fair to give Storke Tower a break every once in a while,ù offered one protester beneath the sagging spire.  God knows I'd be hard pressed to keep a stiffy day in and day out, outside even in the pouring rain,ù offered another student, completely unprompted. As of now, an order has been placed for a massive ViagraÑ¢ to help rectify Storke's posture, but until it arrives, it's up to the students of the hottest UC campus to arouse our most Freudian landmark. † Max Myszkowski wants to know: What makes you flaccid?

Distraught with the anticipation of the truth bomb about to be dropped, one barista bravely stepped out from behind the safety of the counter and made the announcement that Starbucks had run out of soy, almond and coconut milk.  Face after face down the line of customers transformed into a different stage of grief as the shock set in and panic began. Shrieks and sobs rang out around the cafe and pleas to various deities could be heard all throughout Isla Vista. One poor soul even collapsed in a fit of hysteria and could only be resuscitated when a caramel latte was wafted under her nose. The scene could only be described as chaos.  A venti half-caf double shot macchiato, extra sweet,ù Madeline A. said, bravely holding back tears. With almond milk. I get one every day, hot in the winter and iced if it's sunny.ù  Being one of the victims, Madeline formed a Facebook support group for those affected by this crisis, with three others whom she met when a barista called out Maddieù and all four of them went up to grab the same drink.  As reliving the horrific incident reduced Madeline A. to tears, Maddielyne B. approached to take over, holding her hand for comfort.  We just want to be there for other girls in this time of need and have even taken it upon ourselves to start researching replacements for almond and coconut milk.ù Maddielyne B., a third year studying environmental biology, has since been trying to create her own solutions.  I squeezed as many other kinds of nuts as I could, but somehow I can't figure out how to get milk to come out of them.ù  Nearly hospitalized after an existential breakdown, Maddyleighn C. sat wrapped in a shock blanket and recounted the traumatizing event between shaky breaths. She hasn't had milk from a real cow since the fifth grade, proudly spearheading the nut-based milk craze before it was cool to be vegan.  I just have no idea how I'm ever going to get through a whole day of class without my coconut milk extra foam chai latte,ù she murmured with glazed eyes. How can they expect me to order a new drink? I've spent years perfecting that one. There will never be another.ù  As her fellow victims consoled her, a barista chimed in from behind the glass pastry case. You're not lactose intolerant and you haven't been vegan for two years, you could just drink regular milk.ù  Shut up, Chad! You don't understand, I'm in a crisis here!ù Maddyleighn C. exclaimed back. She then went on record to explicitly state that she is not okay. It's honestly fine,ù says Madeiqghlleiynne D. I'll just go to Caje. They never spell my name right on the cups here anyway. Always forget the silent Q.ù  The Starbucks has issued a formal apology to their customers including polite directions on exactly where the afflicted customers can shove their almond milk. If you or a loved one has been affected by this travesty, our hearts go out to you and we at Nexustentialism wish all the victims a speedy, dairy-free recovery.  † Jordan Curiel drinks seven lattes a day and puts non-fat milk in every single one of them.

Fortuna Lane residents and Isla Vista Food Cooperative employees expressed concern about not being able to properly churn their nut butter in peace with the impending crowds.

MIP for Meth: Getting an MIP for meth earns you major bragging rights. You've gone way above and beyond the call of duty of just a simple alcohol charge. You are hardcore and are committed to the party lifestyle. You deserve to bully everyone else because you're a certifiable badass.  † 2. MIP for Cocaine: Cocaine is pretty rad, but it's no meth. You're definitely still pretty dedicated to the Deltopia lifestyle and getting an MIP for being super coked out is a great way to let everyone know.  † 3. MIP for Molly: An MIP for molly is steeping into uncool territory. If you get an MIP when you're rolling, everyone will just assume that you couldn't hang during Troyboi.  † 4. MIP for Weed: If you get an MIP for weed, you've essentially just let everyone know that you're a huge dumbass. Like, honestly, how high do you have to get called out on it? Everyone's just gonna know that you just smelled way too dank in line at Blaze and that the cops sniffed you out.  † 5.

Foot Patrol declared martial law in response to Deltopia weekend. This comes as no surprise to those who have been following Deltopia-weekend police activity over the past several years, as efforts to suppress the inherently chaotic nature of these festivities have steadily grown over time.  This saturnalian event has long stood as a hallmark of the Isla Vista party atmosphere, and its annual reprise awakens the most primordial of party animals within each and every one of its inhabitants, compelling them ìì like bears awakened from a winter-quarter hibernation ìì to prowl the length of Del Playa in search of libations to satiate their carnal thirsts. Unsurprisingly, this festivity has been a subject of interest for the local police force for quite some time now, and they've been relentless in their efforts to quash this celebratory gathering. Though the days of Floatopiaù are far behind us, the essential spirit of the event has remained strong in the face of adversity, refusing to be diminished by beach closures, steadily increasing police presence or the countless ambulance rides incurred as a result of the celebration. We really had no other choice than to declare martial law for the weekend. It's the only way we can keep this community safe during these dangerous times,ù one officer responded while loading a drunk, handcuffed sorority girl into a police van for the 12th time that day. When asked for comment, the sorority girl responded, Uggghhhhh, I juuussssst luuuurve you all sooooo muschhhhhh,ù before collapsing to the ground in a drunken stupor. The National Guard had reportedly been called in to help keep the peace during this tumultuous celebration, and Navy SEAL teams were spotted setting up a makeshift headquarters inside Pardall Tunnel. Considered by some SEALs, the most ambitious operation undertaken in recent memory,ù this undertaking will surely test the utmost capabilities of these elite forces ìì †many of whom were setting up sniper positions atop Storke Tower in order to quickly and efficiently identify any potential mischief posed by Isla Vista's vivacious partygoers. While this totalitarian, militant regime may maintain a firm presence in the area past the duration of the Deltopia festivities, it's important to remember that civil disobedience is the only acceptable course of action to resist this occupation and preserve this sacred tradition for future generations. So, next time you see an intoxicated freshman being loaded into a police van, be sure to give her a salute and thank her for her service.  † Max Myszkowski may or may not have been loaded into a police van.

As the ocean breeze struck his now-exposed underarms, wafting the scent of stale marijuana and BO drowned in Axe body spray, our hero puffed out his rather sunken chest to display the jersey as a badge of prepubescent-level cringe factor. This was his swan song, his cry for help, and one look at the polyester drooping from those scrawny shoulders sent us straight in for rescue.  Wishing to keep his name hidden for privacy and also because he's (rightfully) ashamed, the poor fellow recounted a heartbreaking lack of bro-ffection as well as the void left in his soul now that Saturdays are no longer for the boys.  There's never a, òHow you doin, bro?' or a, òWhat's good, my dude?'ù he spoke through manly tears. No òEaten a vegetable?', òDrank some milk?' or òRemembered how to work a shower, lately?' Nothing. The jersey is my last hope.ù What followed was painful and emotional, but eventually we had to bring up the topic of the blue and yellow jersey clinging to his clammy body. Holding the hand of a Nexus/C.A.P.S. liaison, he responded as such: Nah, KD's a fuckin king, dude. LeBron got nothin on him. That's my fuckin' boi right there.ù Translation: When I wear this jersey, I can pretend that it's actually Kevin Durant's strong arms wrapped around me from behind in a supportive embrace for the entire day.ù  Hours of talk therapy and light probing later uncovered that the true cause of his sudden decline had been a vape pen left on the passenger seat of his 2007 Honda Accord during the hottest day of the month, which sparked a fire and melted the whole of the interior. Our hero is staying strong through this profound loss, but at least his dab pen is still safe in his gym bag. Another victim has thus been saved from the clutches of the most unhygienic òclothing' item since the jockstrap, but our work is far from through. Until all the kind-of-sickly-looking basketball jersey boys can walk the streets in normal-ass clothes again, each of us must offer a helping hand. And probably some soap. Maybe even a spliff, if you've got one.  Sometimes I just feel that if I can expose my fleshy upper arms to the world,ù says he, maybe I can expose my fleshy heart, too.ù  † Bianca Bitchandahalf is curious about why guys who wear basketball jerseys casually are so off putting and firmly requests that they all take a collective shower.

Walking backward, a skill that many tour leaders absolutely suck at, has finally led Bath and many other Tour Guides to their final destination.  It seems as though Bath's lies and atrocious walking techniques have finally caught up to her, as she met the King of the Underworld this past weekend.  It was, like, so weird,ù Bath says. One minute, I'm leading a tour around Storke Tower, and the next, it was like a million degrees. I couldn't see where I was going, obviously, because I had to walk backwards î which is, for the record, the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. Then poof, I was face to face with Mephistopheles.ù  The Gaucho Tour Association has declined to release an official statement, instead saying that they value transparency when talking to parents of recently-admitted Gauchos, the high school hopefuls and the middle schoolers who come to campus sometimes because they obviously don't have anything better to do. Fuck algebra, am I right?  The Tour Association also went on to say that their staff is highly trained at walking backward and forward in a straight line, which is part of the test to become a Tour Guide in the first place, and the rumors of the Tour Guides eating shit at least once a day is just that: a rumor.  While the Tour Association was unavailable for further comment, Satan was more than willing to talk to the press. I don't want them here,ù the Devil told Nexustentialism. They're a totally different breed of evil, and I don't claim them.ù  When asked to elaborate, Satan responded, they tell prospective students that C.A.P.S. is a good service with plenty of availability î that's just a blatant lie and false advertisement.ù Bath has not returned from Hell, but the tour she led has recovered well.  At first, I was really scared, y'know, because Satan is so scary. But I just clutched my rosary and prayed to God. Despite that, I really liked this campus,ù a mother of a recently admitted Gaucho said. I think my child will like it here. The weather is great. Not too hot!

Disguised as a prospective freshman, Pinscher went from booth to booth, looking to score some sweet sleep shirts, key chains and, with any luck, maybe even a frisbee. I pay out-of-state tuition, so who cares if I'm looking to get a free pen or two?ù Pinscher asked when confronted by a guy she had a section with the previous year.

She spun it like 12 times until it landed on a water bottle. She scared away a bunch of potential members,ù Richard Dickù Tate, a tabler for the College Republicans, proclaimed. Suspicious onlookers questioned Pinscher's actual age when she was seen not teeming with nervous energy or looking for the one other kid from her high school who was also visiting. Grad students tabling for the economics department took the initiative to contact the proper authorities about the situation. When asked about their motivation, they yelled there's no such thing as free lunch!ù while foaming at the mouth. CSOs arrived on the scene shortly after. They escorted †Pinscher away from the booths, but not before they tied her hands with lanyards and put a Create Summer!ù tote bag over her head. She hasn't been seen since. The Chief of the CSOs had no comment on Pinscher's current whereabouts, but her roommates are demanding her safe return before the next large event giving out free stress balls. † Matteo Wharton believes that Penney is still in the CSOs' secret torture chamber under the UCEN. #FreePenney

If you don't have clout, your opinion isn't real.

I'd believe him. That guy's cool,ù Smalley said while downing a pint in the back of Woodstock's, allegedly skipping his Environmental Studies 50 section.  It's unclear as to when exactly we will see the fall of DP and the rise of Trigo but frat boy skepticism aside, the general consensus is that it will happen eventually.

While not honing in on one specific individual, the term Florida Manù has been used to encompass the community of strange individuals behind the batshit crazy crimes committed in the Sunshine State. While no community in Isla Vista quite matches the exploits of Florida Man,ù multiple members of the community have pointed out to a different categorization running rampant in the Isla Vista streets.  It's name? Tall White Man.ù My college experience is basically me talking to a girl and a random tall, white dude coming out the cut and swooping her,ù said an anonymous short, non-white student. It's out of control; they all look the same, they all either surf or are in a frat and they keep taking all the girls. They've honestly done more damage to the minority community than anything in history.ù When reminded about institutional racism, colonialism and the multiple other atrocities committed toward minority communities, our source replied Oh yeah. I meant besides that.ù When investigating the claims made by the Brown community at UCSB, the Nexus found multiple sources willing to back up the claim. Oh yeah, 100%,ù said Becky Loughlin, third-year communications major, . That short dude I was talking to never stood a chance. I was just waiting for that totally cute dude with the Bass Pro Shop hat to look my way, and I was gone.ù I hooked up with a 5'7ù dude once, and it ruined my life,ù added Sally Yakub. My friends made fun of me for weeks. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. On the bright side, at least I made that little short guy's day and gave all his short friends hope.ù In a statement constructed by the Short Boyz Alliance (SBA), it was stated that the 5'9ù and shorter community at UCSB will not stand for the mistreatment and verbal abuse thrown our away. First Tinder is making us verify our height, and now girls are treating us like charity cases. It is vile and disgusting.ù So what does Tall, White Manù think about all this?
 What? Hey, man, I'm just trying to get my dick wet.

These portraits, most of which were taken during students' orientation visits prior to the beginning of their freshman years, have purportedly stirred campus-wide melancholy as students have logged in to view their spring quarter classes only to be assaulted by the unsullied naivet√© of their pre-collegiate faces, beaming youthful radiance at their now-bloodshot eyes. Upon seeing the faces of their younger selves, whose livers had yet to be tanned leather-hard by years of binge drinking, many students reported feelings akin to those one might feel upon seeing a baby bird fall from the nest, be run over by a monster truck and then pay $200k for the experience. Fourth-year student Anita Brakeman allegedly recoiled so violently from the innocent, virgin face that greeted her upon accessing the website that she fell backward out of her chair on the eighth floor of the libraryìì much to the contempt of the other soulless inhabitants of the accursed floor. I haven't seen that gleam in my eyes for years!ù the toughened upperclassman cried, lamenting the loss of her youthful optimism and raising her hands to the heavens as if to ask why a benevolent god would allow such a thing. C.A.P.S. has reportedly been inundated with a deluge of these newly disillusioned students, many of whom were so shaken by their experiences that not even a nap in the egg chairs could ease their malaise. In fact, the egg chairs in the building have been relentlessly occupied by blas√©, cigarette-smoking students gazing wistfully off into the distance, only breaking their stares to make cynical, offhanded remarks about the ephemeral nature of innocence. What's the point of it all? You're born, you die, and in-between the two, you slowly realize you wasted what little time you had in this cruel world,ù one jaded, egg-chair-occupying student mumbled in-between drags, blowing smoke directly in this reporter's face.

Not wanting to ever forget their amazing weekend filled with music by their favorite artists, many students swarmed to Instagram or Twitter to show the world about what they did and who they saw this past weekend.  One Gaucho who went to Coachella this past weekend and took away something more than just postable pictures was UCSB class of 2019 student Sarah Toanen. After what she experienced at the festival in Indio, Calif., Sarah decided to completely change her post-graduate plans to commit her life to something more meaningful. When she returned to Isla Vista on Sunday night, she filed a form to create a nonprofit organization aimed at helping those with mental health issues that she named Making Dreams More Alive.ù We asked Ms. Toanen what exactly happened to her at Coachella that brought this idea to her head. So it was my first time at Coachella and when we got there on Friday, my friends and I popped molly for the first time and it was just beautiful and we all had so much fun. So obviously we rolled all three days after that and when we were driving home, I just got like really sad. Like the saddest I've been in like 20 years,ù Toanen recalled. I was wondering why I was feeling like this because I had such a great weekend and was so happy the previous days. Then it hit me why I was so sad: it was because I was leaving Coachella.ù  With this epiphany at the front of her mind, Sarah Toanen returned to Isla Vista and realized what she had to do. She turned her post-concert sadness into a drive to help others afflicted by great misfortunes like her and instantly knew what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. Despite not having much experience with nonprofits or mental health care, Toanen was determined to help these people in need. Yeah so I was like, òIf leaving Coachella could make me the saddest I have literally ever been, bringing people to Coachella could make them the happiest they've ever been.' So my plan right now is basically just raise a lot of money somehow and get like five super sad people and send them to Coachella next year and like probably buy them a couple points of molly.ù When asked what she was going to do about the tens of self-reported job offers she has after graduation this spring, Toanen stated that her newfound passion to help others was too important to ignoreù and will be devoting a good 40% of her time to her organization. When Sarah Toanen was questioned about the possibility that rolling three days in a row was the reason for her sadness, she stated that molly was definitely notù the cause of her anguish because her 35-year-old sister rolls like every weekendù and is perfectly happy.ù It is not clear exactly when and how her organization will choose the people it will support, but there are reports that people who have recently posted a black-screen with text on their Snapchat Stories are going to be given priority in the selection process. † Ryan Milton has reportedly been really sad and also wants to go to Coachella.

This resulted in the loss of internet access across the entire campus in addition to the loss of access to Gauchospace, G.O.L.D. and the Associated Students voting website. UCSB is currently in the thick of the A.S. election season, so the loss of access to the voting website is expected to have detrimental effects on voter turnout.  Oh no, what ever will we do!?ù exclaimed exactly one student. This student, Paul Metzler, is a third-year history of public policy major and, for whatever reason, was planning on casting his vote at exactly 1:17 p.m. today. With the possibility of voting at this exact time abruptly ripped from his hands, Metzler stated, Oh. I guess I just won't vote then.ù Though the websites should be up and running again shortly, Metzler expressed that he lost all interest in voting and definitely won't rememberù to finally cast his vote once the sites are active again. While it may seem like a few hours without access to the website wouldn't make the biggest difference in voter turnout in the long run, this situation has already had a massive impact on this election.  It is reported that at this time, the loss of Metzler's vote has officially reduced the number of voters in the A.S. election from one to zero. This is devastating for all candidates involved, seeing that Metzler's vote alone would ultimately determine the election.  What can I say? Every vote counts,ù stated Beth-Hannah Jackson, a candidate running in the election. But especially that guy's. I'm actually not sure what we'll do now.ù With the loss of this critical vote, it appears that there may not be an Associated Students entity at all next year.

My nest will not be complete until I have snatched a hair off of every head that walks below my UCen perch.  Think you're tricking me by going around my roost? Good luck explaining that you're walking minutes out of your way to avoid a silly little bird. They will call you a fool, and they will walk right into my clutches. You may know the truth, but others underestimate me ¶ and that is my biggest strength of all. So, UCSB administration: Keep putting up your nets to prevent us from nesting, I say. Let us winged creatures flock to the UCen and rain terror on the heads below. I will be the harbinger of destruction on this campus, the general of a mighty aerial fleet. My army will be small but fierce, and you simple, flightless humans will never defeat us.  † The UCen Bird considers this a threat and a promise.

UCSB just recently clawed its way up to the No. 5 spot on the national rankings of public universities, but that prestige is set to come crumbling down as these ghosts of Gauchos past return the school to a time when students spent more time reading the labels on beer cans than they did textbooks. These alumni î who somehow during their tenure here spent even more time coked out than current UCSB students do î have reportedly been thrilled about the university's new high-achieving status. Since the university made the top 5 on the leaderboards, people have started to actually respect my degree for once,ù one returning alumnus told the Nexus. Keep up the good work, kiddos,ù he added before asking if he could still find quaaludes òround these parts. Indeed, the focus of UCSB students has not always been so squarely set on the academic achievements of the institution, and as thousands of alumni storm the campus, they bring with them the zeitgeist of Isla Vista in its heyday: couches burning in the streets, mattress fires, burning banks¶ a lot of mild to moderate arson, really. With all this crime to commit, there's just no way these alumni could have had time to squeeze a study session into their busy, busy schedules.  As current students have begun emulating the actions of the older generation, the academics of the institution have fallen back to their historically mediocre levels, and incidents of drunken revelry have risen back to their historic highs. I could have sworn we were No. 5 last week,ù one confused Gaucho wondered. But now we're back down to No. 8. It's like we're traveling back in time. At this rate, we'll be ranking below the CSUs by the end of the week,ù he continued, fear creeping into his voice. Many returning alumni have not kept track of the goings-on of our community since their graduations and have reportedly felt out of the loop about certain aspects of the university's departure from its party-school reputation. This is made especially evident by the graduates who have taken to mourning the loss of some of our most sacred festivities. One alumnus, distraught upon hearing that Floatopia had been terminated since his graduation in 2006, had this to say about the school's new, more academically-inclined leanings: You've lost your way, Gauchos. You can't just submit to the will of the man. That's, like, totally not cool, dudes.ù He also inquired as to whether the area was at least still plagued by packs of raccoons that roamed the streets at night in search of late-night partygoers to ambush. The Nexus was delighted to respond in affirmation. The influx of senior Gauchos has brought the school back to a different age î one where drunken debauchery ruled the streets and academics were more of an afterthought. That being said, this weekend marks the perfect time to scapegoat the alumni for the party schoolù reputation of this university, despite knowing most of its current students have drank more beer than water in the past six months and wouldn't be caught dead on the eighth floor of the library. † Max Myszkowski has not been to the library all year.

Between awkward appearances at parties and booty calls that came 20 years too late, some alumni decided to make pilgrimages back to the houses they used to live in during their undergraduate years.  One such geriatric Gaucho was Adam Peste, class of 1988, who inched his way down the addresses of Del Playa until coming across the nostalgic numbers he remembered so fondly: 6669. When I saw the old house, all the memories came rushing back, and I thought I ought to tell those youngsters a bit about the history of their house,ù Peste said. As Peste banged the door in his Tommy Bahama shirt and dingy, khaki cargo shorts î a tropical Jehovah's Witness î the current residents speculated about the identity of the old Gaucho. I thought he might have been from the rental company or something, but when I opened the door, he just said that we had a lot to learn,ù Josh Stahp, a current tenant of the property, said. After barging in, Peste regaled the residents with historical facts about the history of their home. Pointing to the corner currently containing Stahp's bed, Peste said,  And ì oh man! That was the puke corner! Every time we had a party at the house and someone couldn't make it to the bathroom, we'd put them in the corner.ù Pointing the residents to the one bathroom on the property, Peste yelled, Damn! This is where we used to have manscaping sessions! Since the trends were changing from mops and bushes to buzz cuts and landing strips, all the guys would take turns shaving and we'd force someone to sweep it all up. I bet there's still a pube or two in here somewhere,ù Peste said with a sigh, content with the mark he left on the world. Finally, as Peste walked into the kitchen, he was struck by a memory as if struck by Zeus's lightning bolt. Oh my god, I forgot that Dana Wilson gave birth in here,ù Peste stammered, mouth agape. †Stahp and the other tenants looked at him in horror, waiting for him to elaborate but praying he wouldn't. Yeah, she was smoking a cigarette right here during a party,ù Peste said. She just looked at her housemate and yelled, òIt's coming!' We cleared the party and called an ambulance, but that baby was already sliding across the linoleum by the time the EMTs got here. I think she named the kid Chad after the guy who helped deliver him.ù The current tenants looked at Peste, awestruck. I just hope that these young men have a new appreciation for the space they're living in,ù said Peste as Stahp threatened to call the police for trespassing. † Chad Wilson thinks being an enthusiastic alum is a latent form of Stockholm syndrome

What was that first? Isla Vista experienced no racist incidents for the first time since March 1987. I've never seen anything like it,ù Officer Pau Urtrip said. I've never seen the minorities of this community so accepted and comfortable for this long a period. Two whole days!ù While the reason for the lack of racism cannot be 100 percent confirmed, it is most likely not a coincidence that this year's version of the Stagecoach Festival, an annual country music festival in Indio, Calif., is also occurring this weekend. Every year, hundreds of UCSB's country music fanatics migrate down south to be serenaded by Luke Bryan and whomever the fuck else they have performing.  While it shouldn't be implied, country music's fanbase does seem to encompass a certain white majority who typically hold cultural views linked with the southern part of the United States. With Stagecoach-goers representing such a large part of the Isla Vista community, it is simple math to see why racism has potentially gone down while they were gone. Other members of the community see an obvious connection. Oh, 100 percent!

This has honestly been the best weekend of my life.ù No word yet on what this next week will bring when all the Stagecoachers come back, but some students are certainly not willing to let cultural harmony become the status quo.

This was unanimously discovered †after Oblesky raised her hand to comment after the professor's lecture on American ideals of meritocracy, saying that she follows this because she makes her son Ethan do chores before he can play Fortnite.  Oblesky's classmates told Nexustentialism that she can be easily identified as the woman trying to commandeer the class, implementing alternative instructions to the professor's (it is unclear if she assumes her likeness in age qualifies her to do this) or by her to-go mug that reads, I'm a Mom. What's your superpower?ù  Further, classmates are unclear as to how long Oblesky has been in school. Some say since 1985, others say forever. There is no in between. Whatever the case, classmate Nelida Silva stated at this point I probably know more about Ethan than American industry.ù  When the professor lectured on American reconstruction, Oblesky told the class that Ethan watches YouTube gamers who advertise different energy drinks, which Ethan buys without her permission.  When classmate Ryan Thorne commented that the current handout neglected to comment on workers' rights of the time period, Tammy followed up by telling that class that as a baby, Ethan got a rash so severe he was hospitalized, and this is why he is short for his age.  Additionally, Oblesky has been an integral part of the class by being very vocal as to which page a pulled quote can be found and using the findù function on her iPad to see how many times the word industrialù appears. On more than one occasion, Oblesky has graciously gone out of her way to alert the professor that the word imperialismù appeared on a handout 45 times.

Print Relatezable mom i know this is satire, but it's in very bad taste. making fun of moms who have the courage to go back to school, including making fun of how long it takes them to graduate and implying they're dumb by making irrelevant comments constantly? rude. moms in school face a LOT of difficulties, more than the average student to say the least, and they're here trying to better their lives, so maybe reflect for a minute next time before you make fun of that. This is so ugly. A non traditional student mom deserves respect, not mockery. I get that this is a joke but it's not a funny one, and it reeks of privilege. Satire is supposed to take a topic and add to the readers understanding or creatively complicate it in some way. Try harder next time.

daily-stench,How To Break Your RA in the Final Quarter,6-May-19,4:20 AM,['Sadie Istic'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-06/how-to-break-your-ra-in-the-final-quarter/,"Nexus File Photo Freshmen, you've almost made it through your first year of college, and we at Nexustentialism would like to sincerely congratulate you! We believe that a fitting celebration would be mentally breaking your RA to the point of no return. Even if you like your RA, it's undeniable that all RAs are inherently evil and have power trips rivaling those of CSOs. Therefore, you're obligated to do everything in your power to break your RA. Nexustentialism would like to equip you with some resident-tested and RA-detested ways to achieve that goal! We've gone into the field and after rigorous testing, determined that use of these methods will drive even the most devoted RA to a mental health crisis.  1. Have sex really î and I mean really î loudly  For this method, you'll have to be in a room next to your RA and be lucky enough to be getting laid as a freshman. In order to do your worst, your typical moaning and bed shaking won't be enough; you will need to invest in some noise-making devices. We've tested everything from maracas to blenders, but determined that two wind chimes fixed to your bed frame, a mallet attached to the headboard and a gong attached to the wall (for those especially powerful thrusts) and a train horn you can trigger for when you and your partner get your big Où make for the ideal set up.  2. Coming to them with fake problems Your RA doesn't get unlimited Portola for nothing. They're paid to be a shoulder to cry on while you face the adversities of transitioning from high school to college, and one effective way to inch your RA closer to a psychiatric break is to totally abuse the fact that they're a contractually obligated listener. The key is to come up with a scenario that will test the limits of your RA's capacity for being an amateur therapist. We recommend coming to them at dawn with news of an ill pet, your parents divorcing or of a new financial crisis that could cause you to drop out. Bonus points if you can combine all three! 3. Commandeering your floor's GroupMe RAs will often set up a floor GroupMe to chat to their residents en masse, but the real beauty of the platform, for our purposes, is that residents can message back. All this method really takes is a couple of friends and a willingness to be the reason everyone mutes the floor chat. Start simple: Abuse the GroupMe like a finsta or private Twitter, bombarding fellow users with an overload of meaningless personal information. From there you need to start turning up the intensity. We suggest trying to turn your floor's chat into a pool of communist propaganda or into a K-pop appreciation forum, but you can pick any topic with annoying fans and go from there. 4. Shower at the same time as them and play podcasts If you and your RA use the same bathroom, all you need for this method is an idea of when your RA showers, a Bluetooth speaker and an understanding that some of your innocent floormates might get caught in the crossfire.  Down to the details: When your RA showers, get in the stall closest to them and turn your speaker to max volume. As for picking a podcast, if you have any information on what your RA dislikes, be sure to search for a super niche podcast about that subject. Otherwise any podcasts where the hosts are condescending or are just too into their topic should work. We've found that economics podcasts hosted by rich white men and yoga-based self-help podcasts are most effective at getting your RA out of the shower before they've even had time to shave their pubes. 5. Make them jealous by talking to RAs from other floors If your RA happens to be very enthusiastic about their job and actually concerned about the well-being of their residents, you can obliterate their self-worth and make them question their ability to connect to other human beings by developing relationships with RAs from other floors of your building. Try to talk with other RAs in spaces where your RA is likely to see you, and make sure that it's clear that you are seeking out advice by looking enthralled and maybe even taking notes. Perhaps if you see your RA around, you could even give them some false hope by initiating a conversation, and then swiftly stab them in the heart by only talking about how great the other RAs in the building are. This will be sure to exacerbate the feelings of inadequacy that your RA has been struggling with since fourth grade. With these strategies under your belt, you should have no problem making sure that your RA will be a fixture in C.A.P.S. for the foreseeable future! † Sadie Istic thinks being an RA is a slippery slope to becoming a DMV worker.

I was kind of having a rough time falling asleep thinking about how having a significant other would literally fix every single one of my problems,ù Dubnoff said. Then, all of a sudden, I heard this couple going at it outside and all those thoughts simmered away. I ended up sleeping great that night.ù The first track of the Couples Arguingù playlist, Babe, I Beg of You,ù is inspired by the verbal tussle Dubnoff heard in Isla Vista that night. Apparently, the entire argument consisted of a man saying Babe, I beg of youù and a woman replying negatively through tears. He says that the failure of the man's begging and the lack of clarity in what he was begging for was what made the experience so soothing. We are so happy with Dubnoff and expect huge boosts in our listenership,ù Ek said. The òCouples Arguing' playlist has something for every young single out there.ù † Daniel Carroll listens to this playlist.

With the queue for this UCen favorite encircling the building many times over, much like one of the endangered Chinese boa constrictors from which the orange chickenù is made, the clock for one student was ticking. Bravely joining the back of the line (now snaking its way through Storke Plaza) time-pressed freshman Darby Hindschej decided to risk it all for a taste of that sweet, sweet chicken-ish goodness. I know I should probably be focusing on my studies for the next four years,ù Hindschej told reporters from her spot in line. But it's just too much to pass up. Plus, I've already sunk too much time into this to leave empty-handed,ù she added, creeping a few millimeters closer to the patron in front of her.

Nick pulled my hair!ù one hungry schoolgirl cried, demanding restitution from the now powerless chaperone.  When asked for comment on the allegations, Nick claimed that the girl had, in fact, bitten his arm first, and he was acting solely in self-defense. At press time, the two quarrelers had been removed from the Panda Express line and were instead being fed granola bars from the chaperone's purse. When the Nexus caught back up with queue caboose some weeks later, Hindschej had moved only imperceptibly from her original spot in line if at all. Someone collapsed from exhaustion a couple days ago, so now I'm one spot closer to the front,ù Hindschej cheerfully reported, gesturing to an ominously human-shaped chalk outline on the ground where she stood.

You know, when I was in high school, all my teachers told me that our professors would be super strict,ù says first-year theater major Alec Azam. They're actually pretty dumb, if you ask me.ù  It is unknown whether or not Professor Kerr will rewrite the midterm entirely or just change the date on the upper right hand corner and say, Fuck it.ù All evidence points to the former because he uploaded the correct version of the exam onto GauchoSpace which caused a massive panic in the 5 p.m. section.  I'm a failure,ù Professor Kerr told Nexustentialism. I spent eight years getting my Ph.D only to embarrass myself in front of 800 kids. Life is so hard.ù † Arthur King promises that this isn't about any specific professor.

What can I say? I'm just a feminist.ù Daniels, a fourth-year film and media studies major, said to overwhelming cheers at an award ceremony in which he was decorated with a medal of valor by Chancellor Yang.  In an email to the Nexus, Chancellor Yang extolled heaps of praise for Daniels, whom he called a model citizen and tender lover.ù  Bryce is the exemplary kind of sexual partner we strive to breed here at UCSB,ù Chancellor Yang said in the email.  However, what Daniels cannot figure out though, in spite of his generous lovemaking, is why Payton remains cold toward him.  Yeah, man, I don't get it. In our three years of dating this is my first time eating her out, but for some reason she's like, super pissed at me right now,ù Daniels said to the press pool at the press conference following the award ceremony.

With big names like Amin√© and Playboi Carti set to headline this day-long trip to Harder Stadium, many in the hip-hop community are excited to see what these artists have in store for this weekend.  At this time, many students are in dismay that they do not know a single song by the other artists. Some are outright infuriated. To get a deeper understanding of why this lineup has caused so much grief in the student community, Nexustentialism reached out to several students.  Don't get me wrong, like I love Carti and Amin√© is cool too, but I have no idea who the other people are. Like not a single song. I can't believe that I'm gonna have to listen to this shit while my buzz wears off,ù second-year Stan Tildeth said, Tildeth went on to note that if he wanted to listen to music he didn't know and didn't want to listen to, he'd go to Alpha Thrift, buy a radio and listen to KCSB.ù This theme of aversion to new artists that the students aren't familiar with seems to perpetuate throughout the student body and appears to be a serious concern for most of the people we spoke with. Though many students we talked to had an overall positive view of the lineup for the weekend, there were still many who could not get over the fact that the A.S .Program Board is metaphorically shoving these artists down their throats. One such individual was fourth-year Ann Grie, who gave us a particularly negative take on how she felt about the lineup. Like I feel that A.S. doesn't even know what people like. There might be a lot of people who like the lineup, but I'm not one of them,ù Grie stated. I usually don't go to Extravaganza because it misses my curated music taste by so much, but I'm going this year just to protest. A.S. can't keep getting away with doing this to people.ù These opinions bring up a valid point: Why can't the Program Board simply get artists that all 20,000-plus students love? All students pay for the concert with their student fees, so the rage students hold against A.S. for not making all their very specific dreams come true is quite understandable. Even if you are happy with who is planned to perform on Sunday, you have to admit that being exposed to dangerous things like new music is not only unsafe, but also a violation of our rights as students. All we can hope for is that next year's Extravaganza will not be so terrible. † Jared Spleez will still attend Extravaganza despite only planning to roll for two of five artists.

daily-stench,Student Preemptively Rolling for Extravaganza,14-May-19,4:20 AM,['Max Myszkowski'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-14/student-preemptively-rolling-for-extravaganza/,"Ollie Tabooger / Daily Nexus Today, nearly a whole business week before Extravaganza celebrations are due to begin, UCSB student Molly Poppins decided to preemptively get in the spirit of the festival the only way she knows how î that's right: pills, baby! With nearly a full week between the time of her interview and the actual date of the festival, Poppins surely had an interesting (and sweaty) week ahead of her. The Nexus followed up with this preemptive pill-popper over the course of the week to document her stimulant-fueled journey. Day One: On the first day of her psychotropic experience, reports claimed Molly could be found participating in an hourly, one-person rave at the base of Storke Tower every time it played that jingle at the top of the hour and tolled to indicate the time. Turns out, with enough ecstacy in your system, anything sounds like EDM. Day Two: On the second day of her amphetamine adventure, Poppins's attention was turned toward the arts buildings. After wandering the halls of the visual and performing arts center, the stimulant-filled student was allegedly transfixed by the most beautiful dance performance [she'd] ever seen,ù as she put it. This performance, though later revealed to have been a racoon and an opossum fighting over a half-eaten burrito, is still widely considered the most avant-garde and groundbreaking performance to take place on this campus. Day Three: On her third day of wild shenaniganz, Poppins î apparently overheated from her nonstop dancing î took a plunge into the lagoon to cool off. Several waterfowl, rightly disturbed by her entry into their habitat, greeted her with snapping beaks. Poppins, seemingly unfazed by this, then proceeded to bathe in the lagoon as if she, too, were part of its natural ecosystem. Though ostensibly cooler from her time in the filthy, slime-laden lagoon, Poppins could now be smelled from up to a mile away as the stench of the lagoon mixed with that of her seemingly perpetual perspiration. Day Four: On the fourth day of her stimulant soiree, Poppins took to the library to prepare for an upcoming midterm she had forgotten about. After running up and down the library tower stairs for three hours, she was politely asked to leave when she tried to start a dance party on the eighth floor by playing Old Town Roadù from her phone. That shit might fly on the fourth floor, but on the eighth? No chance. Day Five: Poppins's final day of celebration was spent rehydrating at the hospital. She did not make it back in time to see Extravaganza. † Max Myszkowski wants you to take it easy this weekend, okay?

I'm very excited to be performing for the student body,ù Yang said. Not many people know about my singing ability and I'm very enthusiastic about the opportunity. I'm humbled to bring the community of UCSB together and put on a performance everyone will remember.ù  Yang has reportedly signed a contract with a record label and his album is set to drop in the fall of 2019, just in time for the new school year.

Third-year UC Santa Barbara student Anthony Wheeler knew the sound all too well. The back inner tube of his bike had popped and soon the sound of grinding metal on concrete soon grew apparent as he slowly attempted to make his 9:30 a.m. lecture at Buchanan Hall. It was all I could think about during class,ù said Wheeler. I caused like 3 accidents at the Buchanan tunnel roundabout because I couldn't go faster than five miles per hour. Do you know how many people overlapped me and called me a òfucking freshman?' Two! It was humiliating!ù While circumstances surrounding the popped inner tube were unfortunate, the solution to fix it seemed easy enough, as Wheeler did not have class again till 5:00 p.m., allowing plenty of time to meander over to the AS Bike Shop in the middle of campus. However, Wheeler was quick to explain that it simply wasn't an option. Oh no, I can't go back there. This is my third popped inner tube of the week, we're basically on a first-name basis over there.ù Wheeler just knewù all they'd do is smile, fix it in five minutes and then tell him to pump his tires to the proper PSI or some shit. Beneath their customer-friendly facades, I could see the contempt and judgement burning in their eyes.ù When asked whether any of the multiple bike shops in Isla Vista were an option, Wheeler was also emphatic in his insistence that nothing could be done. I am actually banned from those establishments. They told me if they ever see my face around there again, they're going to have IV foot patrol take away my bike on grounds of vehicular neglect. I'm pretty sure they were joking cause that's not actually a thing, right? ¶right? After Wheeler began to cry and hyperventilate in front of me for the next 20 minutes, out of pure pity, I offered to take the bike to get fixed at the bike shop myself if he Venmoed me the money. (Update: No Venmo payment has been received). After completing my task, I told him the employees at the shop had suggested Wheeler pump up his tires to the appropriate PSI.ù Hell no, I don't have time for that. It'll be fine.ù And with that, he hopped onto his seat and biked off into the Isla Vista sunset, never to be heard from again.

He looked lovingly upon the blue Frost Four Loko barf stain on the couch and began to contemplate the marks he'd made at UCSB. He looked at several other stains on said couch, proudly beaming at the parts of himself he would be leaving behind.  Reminiscing to his fraternity little about his many crazy nights, he pointed to each stain, remembering the meaningful story behind it. This stain right here I made with Hot Jessica¶ this could have been my son, had I not pulled out,ù Lee-Fluids sighed while gazing into the distance. Oh¶ù replied his little, Matthew, shifting away from the crusted patch of suede.  As part of the fraternity's tradition of sharing their history orally, Matthew noted each of the stains left by his lineage. Enthralled by its rich history, he ran his hands over a rather textured part of the sofa, asking, Is this Braille?ù It was not Braille, but in fact years of caked-on vomit in one specific spot.  This is our yak corner,ù Lee-Fluids said, pointing to a cushion slathered in curdled vomit. Everyone in our fam has yakked there at one point or another¶ and someday you will too.ù Lee-Fluids suddenly fell silent, reflecting more upon his last four years.

Upon this reflection, he realized that his greatest lasting impacts on the UCSB campus were going to be the fluids he left on this couch. The bonds of his fraternity brothers were strong, but not nearly as strong as the bonds between each cushion. As he gazed upon the disgusting but well-loved couch with his little, he made his final mark on the UCSB community. A single tear rolled down his face and onto the couch, briefly rehydrating a splotch of week-old marinara sauce before finally staining the couch with one final mark of love for his college experience. † Mark E.

Surely every student who has had the misfortune of slogging through the college cold and flu season (which is literally just the entirety of weeks two through ten) has heard the melodic tones of violent coughing and hacking echoed around a lecture hall. This unceasing cacophony is what was expected of the 900 person Psych 1 midterm in Campbell Hall last week. But, to her surprise and fascination, Professor Lynne Fluenza recounted the moment when all of her students suddenly began to cough in a synchronized score, resulting in a spot-on performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. I've never seen anything like it,ù Fluenza said. They were all so perfectly in tune. It nearly brought tears to my eyes.ù  Students left the lecture hall with bright red faces and horribly scratchy throats but were greeted by the entire music department applauding vigorously. A new Musical Coughingù major is under consideration by the College of Creative Studies.  The young man who was the first in the class to clear his throat, Fletcher Flemm, was gracious enough to speak to our on-scene reporter.  Cough cough cough wheeze,ù commented Flemm. Cough hack cough, wheeeeze.ù  Another symphonic coughing incident is not expected for another 30 years, but the impossibility of having an actual quiet lecture hall during a test makes it an inevitable event.  Speculations about the next performance include selections from Bach, Tchaikovsky or even the hit Broadway musical Hamilton.ù UCSB is working on an accompanying light show to be set in Campbell Hall for this anticipated special occasion.  UPDATE: Further investigation into this miracle revealed that those infected had gone to Student Health for treatment, where instead of antibiotics or competent medical care, they received magic beans that caused the involuntary cough-singing.  † Ima Noyed doesn't blame the sick students of UCSB at all for coughing so fucking much but is still really irritated by it.

The study found that students in long-distance relationships were quite happy with their freedom in spending all their time with friends and dressing and acting how they please at all times. We discovered that literally every single participant in a long-distance relationship treasures the fact that, aside from a FaceTime here or there, they never actually have to sacrifice any time for their relationship,ù said lead researcher Sarah Springer, who added that the ability to gain weight and drink all day contributed to the success of long distance.  The study also listed several other factors keeping long-distance relationships together. According to the results, the occasional exchanging of an I love youù and I miss youù over the phone provides a satisfactory level of emotional fulfillment needed for a college student.  Furthermore, the study showed that UCSB students in long-distance relationships grew in popularity amongst their peers as sexual targets due to their apparent unavailability. While this increase in attention led to some promiscuous activity, most study subjects merely relished at the idea of increasingly being seen as desirable sexual figures. Some Gauchos doing long-distance simply want the ability to play video games all day or shop with their friends, while others just enjoy the benefits of their òhard-to-get' status,ù Springer said. Our study shows, however, that all of this would come to a grinding halt if these couples ever reunited in person, resulting in an all out implosion of the relationship 100% of the time.ù † Daniel Carroll wrote this.†

These songs show that Jack Johnson is a musician. Jack Johnson, Jack Johnson, Jack Johnson,ù said one Jack Johnson fan, clearly passionate about Jack Johnson. Jack Johnson, Jack Johnson.ù  After speaking with the Jack Johnson fan club, the Nexus obtained some Jack Johnson facts. Here are some Jack Johnson facts that Jack Johnson fans might enjoy about Jack  Johnson: Jack Johnson plays music, Jack Johnson has gone through phases where he sported a beard, Jack Johnson met his wife at Ortega Dining Commons, Jack Johnson lied and said he met his wife at De La Guerra Dining Commons and Jack Johnson was formerly a professional surfer. Jack Johnson,ù stated one matter-of-fact Gaucho. He was quickly echoed by other Gauchos who solemnly nodded while muttering, Jack Johnson, Jack Johnson, Jack Johnson.ù In addition to true facts about Jack Johnson, the Jack Johnson fan club also provided the Nexus with some Jack Johnson facts that may or may not be true: Jack Johnson enjoys kumquats, Jack Johnson has an affinity for beer pong, Jack Johnson has only greened out twice, Jack Johnson HAS returned to the residence halls in order to obtain free condoms and dental dams and Jack Johnson has NEVER urinated on Del Playa. The Nexus has not found any evidence to confirm or deny any of these Jack Johnson statements.  Once again, the Nexus would like to wish Jack Johnson a happy birthday, and encourage every Gaucho to sing Banana Pancakes.ù † John Jackson took a shot of Vitali every time he wrote Jack Johnson.

daily-stench,Modern-Day Saint Refuses To Leave Any Sneeze in Lecture Hall Unblessed,22-May-19,4:20 AM,['Max Myszkowski'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-22/88449/,"Ollie Tabooger / Daily Nexus This Monday, modern-day saint, Benedict Dope Paul II refused to let a single sneeze in his 300-person lecture hall go unblessed. Shocked onlookers witnessed this modern crusader bravely serve his fellow classmates by continually interrupting the lecture to lay blessings upon the allergy-stricken masses around him.  Despite being unable to hear his quiet, pious prayers from all the way across the crowded room, those blessed reportedly felt a sense of divinity wash over them, as cleansing holy light shone upon their blighted bodies, absolving them of sin. These newly-baptized individuals then proceeded to spend the remainder of the lecture glowing slightly as the holy energy of the Lord slowly dissipated, much to the distraction of the students around them. I'm just trying to learn math,ù one lecture-attendee complained, but I can't focus with the Holy Ghost flying around, enlightening everyone who's sensitive to pollen,ù he continued, clearly embittered by having not been lifted into the astral plane along with his fellow classmates. Following the conclusion of the lecture, Dope Paul was swarmed by expectant mothers, sick children and the elderly, all hoping to get one of his blessings while he was slinging them out like hotcakes. Thankfully, this master of altruism was more than able to facilitate the self-actualization of these individuals, and he proceeded to bless the shit out of them †faith-healer style right there in Chem 1179. Indeed, the chemistry building had never seen such awe-inspiring power and had certainly never seen people so eager to enter its confines. I can't believe it! I can walk again!ù one radiant young man exclaimed after Dope Paul sprinkled him with holy water from his hydroflaskîleaping from his seat and tearing off the ankle brace he had been forced to wear following a horrific Birding accident. This devout student has reportedly attracted the attention of the Catholic Church, and this Math 4B lecture is already being cited as his first miracle performed. His official canonization is scheduled for later this week. † Max Myszkowski says gesundheitù to avoid attracting the attention of the big man upstairs.

These nine little angels have graced Storke Plaza pond with their lovely little quacks for the past several academic quarters, and it's high time they got some recognition for the vital role they've served in this community. Though they've had to share ownership of the pond with their cold-blooded, reptilian roommates î the Storke Tower turtles î the ducklings have fully secured ownership over the hearts of the student and faculty populations. Chowder The eldest duckling, Chowder's spunky energy can not be overlooked. Chowder loves the pond and eating plants, and that's it. Bean Bean is known for his radiant positivity and can always be counted on to uplift someone's day. His presence is truly a joy to behold. Lucille Lucille has an unmatched exuberance and is known throughout Storke Pond as a bright light in murky waters. Lucille is widely known for jumping out of the pond and being confused about how to get back in again.  Edgar Classically, Edgar lives by one rule: Carpe the motherfucking diem. Edgar isn't afraid to take risks, and he regularly attributes his success to his fearlessness. Mimi To know Mimi is to love her. A sweet soul, Mimi takes great pride in her family, speaking highly of her brothers and sisters to anyone who will listen.  Monica Who could forget when little Monica tried to climb the stairs of Storke Plaza or when she ate too much bagel crumb and choked it back up. A joyous bird, Monica never stops trying to find the humor in life.  Ryan A simple duckling, Ryan loves nothing more than to swim in the pond in which he was born. Though quiet, it is not uncommon of Ryan to say something truly profound, and those around him would do well to heed his wise words. Wayne Wayne loves to call himself a tough guy, but those close to him know him to be as selfless as he is small. Willing to go to the ends of the Earth for those he cares about, Wayne's devotion to his friends and family goes unparalleled by any other.  Ron Classically inquisitive, Ron can be seen in all parts of the plaza, exploring the large world around him. It comes as no surprise that he often finds himself involved in all kinds of shenaniganz. Ron is fondly admired for his tiny little beak and love of algae and breadcrumbs.  A shrine to their excellence will be erected by the Storke Plaza Pond this week to honor these avian amigos. The mother duck is reportedly overjoyed with the accomplishments of her babies, and confirmed that she's always known there to not have been a single bad egg in the bunch. If you have any congratulations to offer these up-and-coming hatchlings, please call (805)-893-2691 and send any edible arrangements to the base of Storke Tower. † Emma Demorest is eager to see what these young heroes will accomplish in the future.

Foot Patrol after 14 years of proud service because he could not overcome Isla Vista's most dangerous natural predator: sassy drunk girls.  It was with a heavy heart and severely bruised ego that Dillweed turned in his badge, passing the torch to a new generation of high school dropouts who monitor the curbs of DP. His hopes are that the younger officers will finally triumph in this long fought battle due to their extensive knowledge of the internet me-mes.ù  I didn't want to go,ù recalls a misty-eyed Dillweed. I loved being a cop, but those drunk girls ¶ They just kept escaping me with their sheer wit. The shame was too much for me. I have a wife and child to think about.ù  Though put through rigorous Foot Patrol bootcamp, which includes listening for traces of music past 12 a.m. and standing menacingly on street corners with sunglasses on even though it's nighttime, the brave officers face one major gap in their training.  Honestly? We don't actually know how to speak to the conscious ones,ù Officer Richard Anballs. The line is, òHave you been drinking tonight?' But they don't really tell us what to do if the student actually responds with a complete sentence. Coherent answers really freak us out.ù  We were fortunate enough to obtain incident reports of said outsmartings in spite of IVPD's best efforts to bury them, and we must warn readers that what follows is highly classified but also hilarious.  Officer Dillweed remembers encountering an unconscious young woman lying in a park under a tree at approximately 1 a.m. Upon approaching her and shining his flashlight onto her face to stimulate her drunk brain into awake-mode, the officer asked how old the woman was, to which she responded, 18.ù Immediately making the clever assumption that her intoxication made her completely unable to tell the truth, Dillweed accused the girl of lying.  òIf I was going to lie, why wouldn't I say I'm over 21?' That's what she said to me,ù Officer Dillweed reflects on the painful memory. And she was right. I couldn't believe it at first, but that drunk girl was totally right. So I just let her go. I had no choice. It was too embarrassing.ù  He's a good cop,ù Anballs testifies. Those drunk girls, though, they just keep evolving. The other night Greg and I stopped one carrying an open champagne bottle. So we're about to charge her, and naturally we both have massive erections as all foot patrol officers do when giving out MIPs, and she just¶ puts the bottle on the ground and walks away. It wasn't in her possession anymore, there was nothing we could do.ù  Following that incident, Officer Dillweed collapsed in tears on the sidewalk, where he and Anballs were accidentally picked up by two more cops for sitting on the curb.  † Bianca Bitchandahalf is proud to have drunkenly talked her way out of seven citations and cannot wait to continue her fuckery.

TAs around campus are reporting a creeping feeling as if their future as graduate students could be ruined by a few asshole undergrads. In order to remedy this feeling, one TA attempted to connect more with his students by uttering a tentative f-word.  Triye Hard, a TA for a Psychology 1 class, was reportedly boring his students more than usual this past Thursday. When the 16th student slumped down in their seat and started the familiar act of swiping, Hard had to make a last-ditch effort.  Guys¶ I know this is kind of boring,ù Hard stated. HAHA, who am I kidding? It is so fucking boring.ù The use of the f-word caused instant, yet mixed, reactions. Some students immediately began texting furiously, eager to finally have something semi-interesting to say in their group chat that might elicit a response. Several front-row students, also known as kissasses, were seen nodding and muttering in approval. I think it really humanizes him, y'know,ù said one front row gal after the incident. To see a TA use words that us kids use î wow, really makes me respect him more.ù Another group of students, who had become desensitized to the word, just rolled their eyes at Hard's feeble attempt to be cool and adjusted their Thrasher tees.  Lastly, a very select few failed to hear Hard's cursing due to a lack of consciousness. They were later reported to regret not having heard him utter the word. I was really just trying to get in their shoes and have them see the real me,ù Hard explained. I mean, I smoke kush, inhale the devil's lettuce, submit to Mary¶ haha.ù Ultimately, Hard's attempt to better his evaluations failed. When asked how they were planning on reviewing Hard, half of the class stated that his cursing skills would lead them to rate him highly. Unfortunately, the other half felt his endeavor was lame and decided to rank him lower than before. † Maddie Smith likes her TA less now that he said, Fuck.ù

Reflecting on his last four years of party-hopping and drunken, moonlit strolls down Del Playa, Tabooger realized that both his college career and his party connoisseur career were approaching their ends even faster than the cliffs below him were eroding away. He knew what he had to do while he still had the time î he had to find the perfect party.  Standing in the middle of a 65-block soir√©e and feeling needlessly alone, Tabooger decided he would stop at nothing in order to find this mythic rager. With a second wind comparable to that of a Fall Quarter freshman immediately before blacking out, Tabooger slapped a Franzia wine bag and set out with nothing but the end of the 68-block to stop him.  Is it really that hard to create a party atmosphere perfectly tailored to my unique preferences?ù the disgruntled senior lamented. After crashing a string of 65-block parties playing deep house music so unpleasant that even the underclassmen sorority girls couldn't hang, Tabooger took a deep pull from a Vitali handle and pushed forth. Untz untz untz untz untz,ù Tabooger was quoted saying as he slipped into the night.  Lacking any sort of self-awareness, he forged on through the blocks of Del Playa, fighting to get past overly aggressive bouncers only to be disappointed by the parties he was not invited to. For what seemed like hours, the drunken senior meandered on and on, in and out of dirty houses and broken balconies to no avail. † This party is just like the last î wait, I've seen that bouncer before¶ù the weary senior noticed. He kept on, but realized that somehow this was his third time walking down the 65-block. Disoriented and parched (for shots only), Tabooger made his way to one final party î a party he had somehow been to before. Where am I?ù he questioned aloud.  Who do you know here?ù a gentle voice inquired. Knowing no one, Tabooger was ready to turn back around in defeat, but something stopped him. He looked up to face the bouncer and found the bluest eyes he had ever seen -î Ol√© Gaucho? Is that you?ù Who do you know here?ù the bouncer asked him again. Confused, exhausted and rapidly sobering, Tabooger turned to leave when suddenly, he heard his favorite song begin to play from inside. He peered through the doorway and noticed all of his best friends together in one place. He turned to ask Ol√© what was going on, but the mysterious bouncer was nowhere to be found, seemingly having vanished into thin air.  Turning to enter the party, Ollie Tabooger found that he was in fact entering a party at his very own home.  Sometimes, son, you don't need to go searching for the perfect party. It's in you all along,ù Ol√© Gaucho's voice whispered through the wind. Confused but nonetheless wiser, Tabooger entered the party and downed one last shot as the night finally faded into the perfect senior-sender-bender.  Ol√© Gaucho, you sly rascal,ù Tabooger whispered back to the wind, grateful for the alcohol, but even more grateful for the friends Ol√© Gaucho brought him these last four years.  † Ariana Marmolejo is the outgoing Nexustentialism editor and is grateful for the friends the Nexus has brought her these last four years. :')

In this community it is more important than ever to project your indie-ness to show naysayers you do actually exist and you also shaved your head like that on purpose.  As for me, my overgrown armpit hair is actually meant to provoke conversations on hyper-femininity, and my long leg hair is like that because all my friends are doing it. If I didn't have my septum piercing how are people supposed to know that I bring my own mason jar to Caj√©?  My closet? Yes, it's full of only thrifted men's t-shirts that I wear ironically. Why do you ask? Yes I did apply to small liberal arts colleges on the East Coast, and no, I didn't get into any of them because they didn't recognize my absence in senior year classes as good grades.ù  As an indie person at UCSB it's also deeply important to instill a strong, wildly unsettling Instagram presence so that people know you're actually î truly î this way. This is why my profile picture is a pixelated photo of one of the Rugrat babies (idk which one, I never saw the show). Some of my favorite pictures to post to fully convey the strength of my indie are blurry photobooth pics of me pouting like a sad squishy baby with those blue birds above my head, zoomed-in pictures of a finger cut I got after opening a La Croix and many slides of candid photos I took at a party that are good because I took them on film. Which makes me a creative. It's also important to caption everything with a very intimate inside joke that only you will understand.  In terms of clothing, I exclusively shop at the I.V. trading post (it's free, but you have to get to their pop ups early or else they'll have nothing but Pink velour sweatshirts, which aren't cool yet!). I like to arrive to the pop up a day in advance and camp out to be sure I'm the first to get what I need, which usually culminates in a multi layered, multi-patterned outfit that I like because it challenges gender norms. By challenging gender norms I mean people look at me and think, It's too hot for that girl to wear five turtlenecks.ù  The 68 block is the real Isla Vista, and all my friends live on the cool streets (Trigo, Sabado, Sueno, in case you didn't know). My apartment has six or more people, but we're not sure and we've never counted! It's super cute inside because we bought all the furniture from Urban and Ikea and also Goodwill, of course. We only go to band parties and we LOVE Rolling Rock ì no, I don't think it tastes bad. I smoke a lot of ògood' weed or none at all because it makes me CRAZY and I won't tell anyone how. Ketamine is fine, though; it numbs me to the brutal force my skinny body has to endure in all the mosh pits I get into. † As I wrap up my piece, I just want to do a quick shout out for my upcoming documentary, Girlhood,ù about college-aged women finding free expression than I am producing and editing myself. It includes interviews of all of my friends, filmed with a video camera from 2001 that I bought for $500 in a thrift shop in Silverlake. Also, my Dad owns Nissan. † Avocado Feminist harvests her own nut milk and wants to travel the midwest but mostly for the photos.

Wiessass'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/ortega-chef-regains-sense-of-taste-after-20-long-years/,"Max Myszkowski / Daily Nexus In an email from UCSB Housing, Dining & Auxiliary Enterprises, it was announced that the head chef and meal planner for Ortega Dining Commons has regained his sense of taste after 20 years of being bereft of it.  Chef Taye Stless lost the function of his taste buds in 1999 as symptom of a rare foodborne illness which he is rumored to have contracted by eating food he prepared himself. He has been cooking without being able to taste his food since then. His culinary musings during this period of tastelessness developed into what many Gauchos know as Ortega's signature taste, which has been described as squishyù and occasionally pretty good.ù I would like to thank the University for standing by me in these trying times,ù Stless said. Although this has been a drastic shift in my life, I promise that I will keep the flavors that these students have grown accustomed to, while maybe trying out some salt here and there.ù Some Gauchos have commended his bravery in the face of a condition that probably should've ended his career.  I just think it's incredibly brave that despite his complete inability to monitor the quality of food he was providing, Stless never stopped pushing out a definitionally edible product to the masses,ù second-year Mallory Comida said. When asked why UCSB Housing, Dining & Auxiliary Enterprises didn't reassign Stless to a less taste-centric position, a representative told the Nexus that despite his lack of flavor perception, Ortega has had the lowest number of cases of food poisoning year after year under Stless' direction. When people questioned my ability to continue cooking, I always told them that Beethoven wrote his greatest symphonies after he went deaf so I planned to do the same,ù Stless said.  Students who are regularly subjected to the food that Stless and his team produce are cautiously optimistic that the food might improve from the level slop to something more akin to mush. A. Wiessass is more of a Carillo man himself.

daily-stench,TA of Monday Morning Discussion Section Gets Sexual Pleasure From Hearing What You Did This Weekend,3-Jun-19,4:20 AM,['Ryan Milton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-03/ta-of-monday-morning-discussion-section-gets-sexual-pleasure-from-hearing-what-you-did-this-weekend/,"Ollie Tabooger / Daily Nexus It takes an especially driven person to become a TA for a class of undergraduate students and even more so for those brave souls who decide to take on discussion sections on Monday mornings. We at Nexustentialism wanted to try to learn what makes these underpaid graduate students want to deal with the groggy-eyed, irritated and mute Monday morning discussion sections. Could it be they have an innate love for Mondays? Do they just not want to get their sections over as soon as possible? Or is it something much, much more ¶ peculiar?  To get to the bottom of this dilemma, we interviewed a current graduate student in the Mathematics Department, asking why he prioritized having a section at 9 a.m. on a Monday morning. Isaac Ndahed, the aforementioned graduate student, let us interview him in his single apartment with his mattress on the ground and Imagine Dragons playing quietly in the background. I used to hate Monday sections. Like absolutely dread them. But a few weeks into last quarter my girlfriend dumped me for a classics grad student named Xavier. Fuck that guy. So I got pretty lonely and sexually deprived,ù Ndahed stated.  Through his emotional and physical loneliness, Ndahed started finding solace in the bright, young faces of his discussion sections. Eventually, he realized that Mondays are where he gets most of the juicy detailsù about undergraduate life, and that is where he felt the least alone.  So that's when I started exclusively having Monday sections, and I found out besides just jerking off, I could get off by hearing what the students did during their weekend. It's literally my favorite question to ask, and I ask it right when class starts,ù Ndhahed replied. He told us that he will not even start class until at least someone tells him they got black-out drunk or lost their coke-ginityù. His taste for stories the students tell has gotten quite particular, and he stated that he now frequently kicks students out of his class if they tell him they just sleptù during the weekend.  Isaac gave us his permission to use his real name for this article, but we questioned why he would want this information to be posted after he told us his main reason for solely choosing Monday mornings. Yet he told us how it is actually a pretty common kink in the Math Departmentù.  Though we did not exactly love to hear about the sexual tastes of a graduate student who should probably just download Tinder, it did give us an interesting peek into the exciting life of groups like TAs, who are often taken for granted. With this knowledge, hopefully more undergraduate students will learn to avoid these sections like the plague or at least not have boring weekends. † Ryan Milton personally thinks graduate students in the math department are hot and should wait for a girl that likes wearing running shoes and jeans just as much as them.

This option brought two lucky Gauchos together, officially giving the Missed Connections option a 100% success rate.   Cassey Deya, a frequent victim of bicycle accidents, wrote the following:  To the asshole who ran me over on the bike path by Pardall:  I was trying to go home when you crashed into me. When I fell, it was like slow motion. I saw your beautiful locks of blonde hair and thought to myself, òI'd fuck this guy.'

I like slangit.com's definition: A hot take is a term that refers to a controversial opinion. It is referred to as òhot' because it goes against the majority of opinions and can rile people up into a frenzy.ù I'm going to make a few of these and see what happens. Enjoy! Keanu Reeves is the only decent man in Hollywood. Picture this: John Wick, Neo, John Wick 2. In and of itself, this discography is devastating. Then you take into account that Keanu Reeves almost went by the name Chuck Spadina, and you have all the ingredients for a perfect story about the only enigma who can truly save Tinseltown. It's a cesspool out there, people. And if Keanu can't save the day, runners-up include Bill Murray and Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers.ù Em dashes are parentheses for people who think Herù is actually a good movie. I'll walk you through this one. Em dashes suck, and anyone who likes using them is a pedantic excuse for a Harvard reject. Suck it up and use some sexy brackets.

They can go to their stuffy dinner parties in Pismo by their lonesome; the lasagna is terrible and probably gluten-free. Oh, I almost forgot that I included a movie in this hot take.  Herù is a shit storm, and Joaquin Phoenix should be ashamed of himself for starring in it. He turned down Olivia Wilde for a Bluetooth? GET ME OUT OF HERE, SIRI. Speaking of movies, La La Landù was a dumpster fire. And so was the porno Shape of Water.ù The two leads in a musical can't sing. What? Moreover, how can the racist with a rotting finger be the most likable character in a film? It's only possible when you create a pile of garbage like Shape of Water.ù Pan's Labyrinthù also blows, Del Toro. Kanye West will win the presidency in 2024. This one is a no-brainer. He's got the charisma, and the chains of society have certainly been lifted off of this beautiful soul. He questions all that can be questioned.

He was seen to have been turning students away and only letting a select few in to speak to the professor.  He asked me who I òknew here,'ù said one confused student. And apparently everyone was saying they knew the professor, so he said I couldn't get in without an invite.ù Lee was also reportedly telling students that he did not want to mess up the ratio and therefore would only let a few freshmen in. Anyone with an òaddy' was granted immediate admittance. None of the students reportedly knew how to obtain the òaddy.' When you sign up as a TA, you sign up for the tough jobs too,ù Lee explained. Sometimes that means limiting certain students access to the knowledge their professor has in order to let a particular group of students gain that knowledge.

I don't even blame them; it makes life more thrilling. So, you can imagine my surprise when all three of my roommates said that their subletters are moving in as soon as the quarter ends! And no, I did not get to meet them first, which is a damn shame, because I'm super cool and really funny and anyone would be lucky to be my friend. Instead of studying for finals, I have been plagued by anxiety-ridden thoughts about the strangers I'm going to be living with for the entirety of the summer. Seriously, it's keeping me up at night, and as the move-in date approaches, my fears just keep worsening. What if the subletters are weird? What if they don't like me? And worst of all: What if they don't think I'm funny? I don't think I can live with people like that, and quite frankly, I don't deserve to live with people who don't think I'm funny. I'm better than that. To say that I'm excited to meet these strangers is a gross overstatement. I am, in all honesty, scared shitless. There are some pretty terrible people in I.V., and I don't think I can live with someone who doesn't respect my rules. If you wear shoes in the house, that's one thing, but not laughing at my jokes? Sorry, you're going to have to move out ASAP. My absolute worst fear is that I room with someone who thinks that they're funnier than me. A lot of people think that they're better at telling jokes than I am, but this is simply not the case. It is scientifically impossible to be funnier than me î a fact that is backed up by all of the scientists known to man. Thankfully, none of my roommates this year turned out to be funnier than me, but they did turn out to be inconsiderate, hypocritical shitbags who don't know how to communicate (or tell a joke). It's okay, though. We've all had to live with people we don't like at some point. The optimistic part of me sees this as an opportunity to make new friends, but the realistic and much funnier part of me sees this as an opportunity to test out a couple of wisecracks. I'm going to be very sad and upset if my future roommates don't laugh at my jokes. I'm serious, I will cry, and I'm way too hilarious (and funny) to cry. That said, I'm excited for what this summer holds! † Arthur King wants you to know that he's funny.

As if there weren't enough construction projects during the regular school year, UCSB seems to find summer the optimum time to showcase the incomplete nature of the school î perhaps to give incoming freshman at orientation a taste of what it feels like to live in a postmodern episode of Bob the Builderù that is focused on higher education and occasional drug abuse. One of these necessary renovations announced was the recent approval of several gleaming new tons of dust that will be spread all across Girvetz Hall throughout the summer. Those Gauchos who have been blessed enough to have had a discussion section or even a lecture in Girvetz are no stranger to the dusty wonderland that welcomes them when walking into this hall. Along with this renovation adding to the prestige of our school, representatives from the Chancellor's office reassured the public that the money being used for this project is, of course, coming from our student fees; but representatives say not to worry, because the whole idea for this surprise improvement to such a famous hall is to further remind humanities students that they are grosser and dirtier than S.T.E.M. majors. Along with these statements, UCSB officials remarked that they, ¶ legitimately don't know how Girvetz could look worse, so why the fuck not ¶ ,ù approving this proposal quite quickly. Despite the lack of an actual reason for the project, there seems to be very little resistance against it. To get a feel for why there was a lack of outrage over such a blatant waste of money, we at Nexustentialism asked a couple students for their opinions on the renovations: I just don't care what happens to Girvetz,ù fourth-year student Anita Rihmie stated. Like, I don't think I could think of a more inconsequential building. It coulda been lost in the Thomas Fire, and I don't think anyone would have noticed.ù Second-year student May Jerbaut responded to our inquiry by saying, If it were any other place using the money I pay to fund this, I'd be upset. But it's UCSB, and I'm pretty sure our school would have sponsored the Fyre Festival given the choice to.ù With these very colorful opinions regarding the new renovations in mind, check back here for future updates on how much grosser Girvetz can possibly get before it is officially quarantined.

These findings have been corroborated by numerous eyewitnesses who have described sightings of the desiccated, nomadic foliage venturing as far as the 68 block. These days, I reckon there's been more tumbleweeds òround these parts than you can shake a stick at,ù one rugged, poncho-garbed man grumbled from beneath the brim of his cowboy hat before hocking some chewing tobacco into a nearby spittoon with a resounding ping. This increase in wild, windblown vegetation has correspondingly seen a rise in western-style standoffs across the Isla Vista area. Indeed, many inhabitants have taken to standing across the street from one another in matches of quick-draw, eyes locked in steely glares, Juuls holstered, waiting to see who will make the first move. Bouts like these have reportedly lasted for hours before one of the fiends gives in to their nicotine addiction and rips a fat cloud, ceding victory to their opponent.† Several families living in Isla Vista, who are usually relieved by the decrease in rowdiness during the summer, have filed noise complaints with the police department, claiming to frequently hear the theme from The Good, the Bad and the Uglyù ringing out late into the night.

The skeleton crew of summertime students, however, just simply isn't enough to prevent the area from reverting to its natural state as a part of the Western frontier, and were it not for the return of the community's inhabitants in the fall, the whole area would be overrun by the raccoons, possums and skunks to whom it originally belonged. † Max Myszkowski was born in the wrong century.

Second things second: UCSB has officially qualified as Division 1 in our sacred drinking ritual! As of this summer, UCSB is officially leading the world in competitive drinking. With an incoming class ready to fill the team roster with thousands of prospective red Solo stackers and thousands of seasoned, veteran players already enrolled, the new team is already set up for one hell of a season.† This almost makes up for the fact that we don't have a football team,ù said third-year student Talia Gaiter. Now we can drink before, during and after sporting events î we really are a world-class institution.ù Anyone who has played a round or two of this game can attest to the intense pressure that steadily rises as the stack of cups into which you must bounce your ping pong ball grows taller and taller. This growing tension in the game, coupled with the brilliant catharsis of the full beer awarded (most often punitively) to the person who gets the last cup, provides the perfect story arc to each playthrough of the game.† As a show of respect to our forefathers, the inventors of this fast-paced drinking game, we as Gauchos ought to honor their contributions to the art of turning casual drinking into a frenzied panic over who's getting the bitch cup. Masters of their craft, the alumni who pioneered this field of competitive drinking have long since put away their ping pong balls and red Solo cups, but thankfully we, the current students of UCSB, have dutifully carried on their legacy, elevating this sport to previously unimaginable heights.† Much in the same way oral histories and traditions have been passed down through generations for millennia, perhaps Gaucho Ball will one day cement its place in the collective consciousness as a fundamental part of the human condition. If not, then it has at least certainly cemented itself as the easiest way to get drunk off free alcohol at a stranger's party without getting caught. † Henri Bemis made the team and will be redshirting this season.†

It has been revealed that î for the first time î phishing scams now make up the majority of the notifications sent to students by this system. In the wake of this revelation, students and faculty alike have expressed great concern over the security of the university's primary messaging system. Wait, so you're telling me they're not forgiving all my student loans?!ù second-year student Gilly Bull said. I gave them my social security number, bank account number and mother's maiden name,ù she added. Do you think that's bad?ù Administration officials have yet to release an official statement on the duplicitous nature of their notification system, though several have allegedly released follow-up emails warning of the dangers of phishing scams. The authenticity of these follow-up emails is currently also under suspicion, however, as most of them begin with: CONGRATULATIONS! You're the 10,000th student to receive this notification!!! Click the link below to receive your free prize!!!ù In an attempt to glean some more insight into the phishing process, Nexustentialism reached out to well-known phishing connoisseur and supposed Nigerian prince, Mahnay Pleesi, for his take on this situation. There's only one way to put a stop to these fraudulent emails for good,ù he said. All you have to do is wire $500 in Bitcoin directly to the following account, and all your troubles will be gone.ù Nexustentialism would have sent the requested funds but was halted by the fact that we don't make that much money in a year and because our editor in chief said no.ù If, however, you would like to see this issue resolved once and for all, simply send a cashier's check for $1,000 in an unmarked envelope directly to the Daily Nexus office. Your contributions are greatly appreciated. An explanation as to why the university's cybersecurity is so often thwarted has yet to be found. Faculty members from the computer science department were contacted for further information but offered little insight. Not my problem,ù one professor of computer science told Nexustentialism. They don't pay me nearly enough to clean up that mess.ù† † Little known fact: Max Myszkowski is actually a Nigerian prince.

Despite growing controversy surrounding the construction of the world's largest observatory on the mountain, there has surprisingly been little resistance to the proposed theme park attraction. DisneyÆ executives have been adamant about the value to be gained from the construction of this high-octane attraction atop the sacred summit of the Hawaiian peak, citing the extreme thrillsù and stacks of mone î [cough cough] ¶ erm, I mean buckets of fun!ù to come of the ride. When asked about the specific location chosen for the construction of this attraction, those same executives assured there's no better place to build a space-themed attraction than as close to space as possible,ù and that this attraction would help humanity peer deeper than ever before into the vast, unknown reaches of [their pockets].ù Executives were unable to be reached for further comment, as they had all returned to their usual schedules of commercializing every possible inch of the island into a DisneyÆ property, sipping mai tais, and hunting people for sport. Everyone likes roller coasters,ù one would-be protester told Nexustentialism, unlike that nerd shit those scientists tried to pull with that lame telescope.ù While many native Hawaiians justly abhor the idea of a commercial attraction being constructed on land they consider sacred, developers at the site have assured them it's nearly impossible to remember the slow death of the native culture of your homeland while accelerating at 3.7 G's around an adrenaline-pumping, cosmos-inspired, indoor roller coaster track. Though many felt reassured by this statement, some islanders below the coaster's minimum height requirement have remained skeptical. Could governments and corporations just respect the autonomy of indigeneous peoples for once?ù one islander asked in what was likely the most overly optimistic expectation set for the U.S. government that week, given its track record. Though this question was most likely rhetorical, Nexustentialism feels the need to clarify that the answer to this question is: no, probably not. With the big mouse upstairs closing in on much sought-after real estate atop the hallowed peak, the race to develop the once-pristine peak into a profit-maximizing machine has officially begun. And while the ethics of this whole debacle are fuzzy at best, at least this indigineous rights violation comes with a side of The Happiest Place on EarthÑ¢ù. † Max Myszkowski thinks the first CEO to develop commercial enterprises on Mauna Kea should be thrown directly into the volcano.
Print The polls that have been done show that the majority of Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians) favor TMT. In 1880, King (David) Kalakaua said he wanted to establish an observatory in Hawaii. Max chooses to repeat the narrative of a vocal mob. After UCSB 1975, then UCLA grad 1977, I moved to Oahu. During my 30 years there, I took every Hawaiian language course available at the Univ of HI, Manoa.

Empirical evidence collected over the Summer Sessions has shown that the true cause of the immense amount of haze in I.V. has not been caused by a unique environmental phenomenon, but rather because THEE boys just won't stop blowing fat clouds. I didn't have anything else going on for me this summer, so I decided I'd spend all my time vaping,ù incoming second-year philosophy major Angus Bj√∂rn said.† And when we're not vaping, we're burning! Hahahah,ù his housemate, Anton Chekovich, added.† Bj√∂rn and Chekovich live in a garage with 10 other male students who collectively, as a result of all the vaping, share a total of 28 remaining brain cells. They lovingly refer to themselves as The Boys.ù† While The Boys share a special bond amidst a cloud of dense mango haze, they're not the only ones who are contributing to the unusual fogginess of I.V. All over I.V. heaps of similar, nicotine-dependent young men who will definitely have heart attacks by age 30 just can't seem to put down their vapes. Groups and groups of The Boysù just can't seem to stop blowing fat clouds. It feels so special to be a part of something greater than ourselves,ù third-year undeclared major John Chadson said through his throat hole.† Chadson speaks on behalf of his boys, mostly because his boys have all lost the ability to speak due to the dangerous side effects that come from grossly abusing Juuls and Suorins.† Fortunately for those boys, Chadson is still able to communicate through the modified speaking hole in his throat.† I always knew that if all The Boys came together like this, we could accomplish anything,ù Chadson wheezed. Now onto fatter clouds!ù It is not yet known if there will be any lasting environmental impact on the I.V. community due to the lack of sun, but only time will tell. With winter and its usual fogginess on its way once again with the changing seasons, it will be harder to tell if incoming fog is caused by The Boys or nature. The most clear way to know if clouds are from The Boys is by the presence of a light fruity smell, sometimes with a hint of mint. Nah, it's always The Boys,ù Chadson concluded. We just can't stop, won't stop.ù † Ollie Tabooger strongly urges readers to blow fat clouds with caution.

And he chose truth. We asked him what the worst thing he did back in the good ol' days [see: high school] was. Albert told us that one time he stayed up until 1 a.m. playing Minecraft instead of studying for an AP Latin exam, almost forfeiting his 4.35 GPA and his 97.3% in the class to a bad test. I guess it is a bit odd that he was so specific with the numbers¶ but we were too in awe at their immensity to care.ù However, Todd isn't always this sly when it comes to talking about his high school prowess.

Her internship with NASA and letter of recommendation from former first lady Michelle Obama may have secured Stein her place at the University of California, yet fell short in preparing her for the most emotionally and physically taxing obstacle of her young adult life.† Raising $100,000 for stem cell research was a cake walk compared to this,ù Stein retorted, crying hysterically as she clung to her trusty vehicle. So far, I've fallen off my bicycle six times and ended up at the wrong building twice î and that was just this morning. I haven't been this scraped up since I built all those homes for the impoverished in Kenya.ù† Yesterday, Stein narrowly avoided a fatal collision with campus cat Big Boy. Nexustentialism reached out to the famous feline for an interview, but he refused to comment on the traumatizing incident. To the UCSB Office of Admissions, Stein seemed like the perfect candidate for admission. Between her perfect GPA and stellar extra curriculars, she proved herself to be more than capable of handling î even dominating î all the trials and tribulations that come with becoming a college student. Her personal insight questions detailed her long-standing value of perseverance in the face of adversity and the many ways in which she applied this value. These anecdotes include testing hundreds of prototypes until she built the perfect robot to take care of her terminally ill mother and valiantly petitioning to create a kickball league for disabled students across her home county. But to Stein, the bike loops are an entirely different ball game. There's just no way we could have foreseen this,ù one admissions officer commented in response to Stein's bike-related incompetence. It's a miracle that Enya committed to UCSB in the first place instead of jumping straight into the tech field and designing flying bikes for Elon Musk.ù† Until the day that airborne bikes grace the skies of Isla Vista, Stein will continue on her path to greatness î one panicky pedal at a time. † Sierra Vakili is highly considering just walking to class.

Upon conducting his primary inspection of the sparsely furnished living space, Green realized î with equal parts embarrassment and disgust î that his new residence was a complete and utter shithole. The water pressure is garbage, the paint's peeling off the walls and the whole place smells like a basket of ass,ù the previous freshman said, regarding the condition of his new home. The only happy tenants here are the cockroaches î of which there are many,ù he added, pausing to squish one of the freeloading pests with his shoe. Greene's roommates had similar complaints about their new living situation, adding noisy upstairs neighbors, a family of racoons who had taken up residence in their dumpster and a homeless man who had moved in alongside them. Greene and Co., who started their search for housing two weeks before the end of spring quarter, were surprised the building had not been condemned î especially given the pungent black mold in the shower, leaky ceilings and ominously and ominously stained walls (blood?). The rental agency in charge of the property, which explicitly forbade Nexustentialism from publishing their name (though it rhymes with [insert shitty landlord here]), has reportedly already spent Greene's security deposit on purchasing another property in the area. The place was absolutely spotless when they moved in,ù a representative from the agency claimed. We actually just renovated that specific unit î it's nicer than ever,ù he said, referring to the recent installation of a single lightbulb hanging from a bare wire above the kitchen sink. Greene and his numerous roommates considered finding a new place to live, but then remembered they all signed a legally binding, year-long lease without reading it first. Yeah, but who reads the terms and conditions, anyway?ù Greene's roommate said, casually shrugging as if his repulsive living situation had been completely unavoidable. C'est la vie, amirite?ù At press time, the family of raccoons had been welcomed in as subleasers of the zero-star abode. † Max Myszokwski does not currently live in a shithole, but he did last year.

daily-stench,A Brief History of Storke Tower,1-Oct-19,4:20 PM,['Emma Demorest'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-01/a-brief-history-of-storke-tower/," As many are aware, the idea behind Storke Tower came as a fever dream that then-chancellor Conrad H. Hornbreau had while fighting what would ultimately become a fatal bout of dysentery. Initially disinterested with the idea of building anything worth looking at on his university campus, Hornbreau had a change of heart when his neighbor, a Mr. Jean Fitsimmons, reportedly told Hornbreau one Sunday, Your university looks as unkempt as your hedge of begonias.ù Hornbreau deliberated over many stately building plans, but it was what came to fruition in his fever dream that would become what we today know as Storke Tower.† According to family members, Hornbreau saw something he described as like the thing in Washington, but girthier, and differentù he then went on to say that the flat top of the building would create the perfect landing strip for the balloon ships of the overlords when they come to use our human tears for smoothie juice.ù† Those immortal words were to be his last, as he died immediately after uttering them. Out of a deep respect for the fallen chancellor, the building was constructed, and Hornbreau's remains rest in the tomb beneath to this day.† Though Hornbreau's predicted overlords never came, Storke Tower has served the school well in its 50 years. In 1973 it was used as a modern arc for local wildlife during Storm Denise (unfortunately no one thought to close the windows and all the birds flew out), and in 2005 was the centerpiece of David Blaine's largest disappearing act, which would be known as the only trick Blaine actually did wrong (hundreds showed up to see Storke disappear only to watch a frustrated Blaine wave a small towel near the building, eventually giving up). In 2010 Storke Plaza was home to UCSB's first Deltopia, where over 50 Gauchos attempted to live it up in the plaza pond, immediately contracting bird flu.† Storke has seen this and many more in its time as a UCSB centerpiece. Here's to the stories yet to be told, old friend. † Emma Demorest has dedicated over fifty seven years of her life to Storke's vibrant history.†

Hell, we might even elect him president of the frat next year, he's that awesome.ù† Currently, Sigma Tau Omicron Pi is discussing whether or not to rename the fraternity after Lion, in addition to the possibility of Lion assuming the presidency of the frat next year.† Lion also went to his first party on DP this week. He successfully managed to find the street without getting lost, and Lion didn't even black out. What an accomplishment! He was reportedly respectful at the party and even cleaned the house the party was held in. Such a good guy!† Lion also attracted the attention of Chancellor Yang, who was not at all shocked or surprised to see a mountain lion on campus.† Lion continuously serves as a valuable member of the UCSB community, and we hope that all students follow his example. Lion is truly the pillar of our community, which is why I'm announcing that UCSB will now officially change its mascot to the mountain lion.

daily-stench,Best and Worst Majors by Smell,8-Oct-19,4:20 PM,['A. Wiessass'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/best-and-worst-majors-by-smell/,"Harvest Keene / Daily Nexus † We have all had the experience of sitting next to someone in a lecture hall and being assaulted by the smell of your neighbor. While I firmly believe that anyone can stink or smell incredible, here are some generalizations on the best and worst smelling majors at UCSB.† Worst: All CCS majors Acting as an undercover CCS major this summer, I have made a startling discovery: these people are, on average output the most BO per capita out of any major at UCSB. People in the College of Creative Studies are often known for being overachievers and they carry this reputation over† into being fucking smelly. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that no CCS classroom has AC and that practical application of deodorizing compounds is nowhere to be found in their curriculum.† Second Worst: Philosophy I guess these people are too busy contemplating the metaphysics of reality to contemplate buying a goddamned stick of Old Spice. In my discussions with phil majors,† they clearly consider a lot, but I have found no moral dilemmas in taking a shower every once in a while. Our future philosophers should take a page out of Plato and Aristotle's books and visit a bathhouse occasionally. Most Neutral: Poli Sci These sycophantic cannivers will smell however you want them to smell, especially if you have an internship or some kind of club leadership position that they can put on their grad school resumes. You want them to smell like literal dog shit? Done! Want them to smell like Chanel No. 9? Done! But just so they don't offend someone who could be a potential employer, they go scentless in their day-to-day life. Second Best: Psych and Brain Sciences This is just because I miss my ex who was a PBS major :( ¶ But my roommate is also a PBS major and she smells ¶ pretty good! Best: Chem These motherfuckers must synthesize their deodorant because I have never smelled a chem major that wasn't an olfactory pleasure to behold. These people must have a direct link to the gods of scent, because there are scent combos I have never heard of creeping into my nostrils as I stroll by the chem building. Lavender French vanilla, goji berry coconut milk, Old Spice AQUA REEF!! Are you kidding me?! Calling these people scent icons would be a severe understatement. I declare chem majors Aromatic Aristocracy.ù † Wiessass is at least two of these majors.

daily-stench,Lost Freshman On SBMTD Bus Winds Up in San Bernardino,10-Oct-19,4:20 PM,['Max Myszkowski'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/90307/,"Emma Demorest / Daily Nexus † Somewhere, Calif. ìì In a spectacular yet relatable blunder this weekend, freshman Greg Harrison somehow ended up riding a SBMTD bus over 150 miles to the suburbs of Los Angeles while trying to take the 24X from campus to FT. Harrison was reportedly trying to make it to Portola Dining Commons for dinner when his meandering metro adventure started and is now lost, afraid and so hungry that dinner at Portola sounds like a good idea. Nexustentialism caught up with several of Harrison's would-be dining companions (all FT natives) in hopes of finding out more about the transportation tragedy that befell him. I honestly don't know why he even wanted to come here for dinner when DLG is both on campus and, like, wayyyy better,ù said Harrison's friend, who identified himself only as The Man.ù Mr. Man, having clearly given up hope that his friend would make it to Portola before closing time, then solemnly took a place in line for the highly coveted waffle-maker. When the Nexustentialism eventually tracked down the hopelessly lost freshman to ask for his comment on the situation, he had only the following to say. Do you know how to get back? My phone is dead and I want to call my mom,ù Harrison said to our reporter, who caught up with the lost traveler in the field. I don't know where I am. Can you please help me?ù Our reporter chose not to lend their cellphone to the weary vagabond in order to preserve the integrity of the story. And although Nexustentialism respects and supports this choice, we are saddened to report the student has not been seen since. While many new students find themselves bewildered by the machinations of the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit Department, few find themselves led as astray as poor Harrison. With bus-route literacy dropping lower with each new incoming class, UCSB may soon have an epidemic of lost students scattered throughout Southern California. With any luck, however, most of them will figure it out eventually î either that, or they'll be forever lost to the labyrinthian abyss of the SBMTD bus routes, in which case: problem solved! Max Myszkowski has a love-hate relationship with public transportation.

I honestly have no idea what he was thinking,ù Police Chief Brett Oinkerson said. In all my years on the force I have never seen such a stupid and perplexing act by a student.ù According to eyewitnesses at the scene, no one is exactly sure how Torres ended up in the middle of the bike loop. It was as if he appeared out of thin air. Our group was walking to the library from HSSB, when he suddenly disappeared,ù Torres' friend Luke Fresh said. We didn't know where he went until we heard a primal scream for help.ù Once Torres realized he was trapped, he proceeded to take off his shirt, roll up into a ball and repeatedly ask people passing by to contact his RA so she could save him. I don't know man, I kind of just blacked out,ù Torres said. No comment, ok?ù As bikers continued to fly around the loop at top speed, it became clear that an on-the-ground rescue was not going to be possible. We did not feel comfortable sending our men on a mission that would most likely result in casualties,ù an executive statement from the White House read. It is with this realization that we decided a helicopter was the only logistical way to protect American lives from the bike loop.ù At approximately 1:54 p.m., Torres was airlifted out of the Storke Tower bike loop without disrupting rush hour traffic. I've deactivated 25 live bombs, and I must say this mission was 10 times more difficult,ù one Navy SEAL said. Impeccable work.ù When contacted, Chancellor Yang had only one brief comment: I hate freshmen.ù † Kian Karamdashti wants you to be safe while all the freshmen learn how to ride their bikes during week one.

But when the plandles pile up and you narrowly miss stepping in yet another splatter of suspiciously colorful vomit, you may begin to wonder: How can I black out in an environmentally responsible way? Luckily, the folks here at Nexustentialism have done the hard research for you! Here are the five most eco-friendly ways to punish your liver. † Buy in bulk I.V. Co-op has long been known for being the go-to grocery store for some barefoot lady with a septum piercing to fill her upcycled mason jar with cashew butter, but reportedly the shop will be adding an even more important staple to the bulk section: that's right, alcohol! Buy one of the pre-weighed mason jars or even upcycle an empty New Am handle, and bam! One trip to the Co-op and you're on your way to Sendville.† †  Scavenge Every last drop counts! An important part of being eco friendly is never being wasteful, and that includes those last few drops of Malibu. If you're really committed, a cool zero-waste way to get drunk is to scavenge through the trash bins of I.V., and you'll eventually find enough half-shotgunned beers and preemptively discarded Claws to get buzzed. Bonus points to freshmen who are already scavenging to get a few drops of alcohol in! The youth really are the future of our climate reality. † Be a S.T.E.M. major Technically, this is reducing your resource consumption simply by reducing your alcohol consumption, but hey, I guess it works. Not that STEM majors necessarily have to be straight edge, but the way they never shut up about being too busy to have fun, I'd assume that they all are.† † Ferment your own alcohol from dining commons scraps It's not going to taste good, but neither does the food at the dining commons anyway.† † Drink Vitali Satire aside, this one might actually be true: Vitali is much less processed than more expensive, smoother vodkas. Less processing equals less energy wasted on production, therefore, it is the most eco-friendly handle there is! This would be a super awesome green living hack if it weren't for the fact that environmental ruin is more appealing than drinking straight Vitali.† † Al Goer will give up red meat and fast fashion for the environment but sure as hell won't give up drinking.

To Ask Students to Maybe Try To Be Happy, Instead of Sad?ù",24-Oct-19,4:20 PM,['Emma Demorest'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/c-a-p-s-to-ask-students-to-maybe-try-to-be-happy-instead-of-sad/,"Emma Demorest / Daily Nexus † With collective pressure on California universities to better student health services, UCSB's Counseling and Psychological Services program has launched a groundbreaking See the Sunny Side!ù initiative.† The proposed initiative aims to support students' mental and emotional health and will input more depth and attention toward one-on-one therapy sessions. To further accommodate students,ù said Tracy Peterson, director of Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.), We will be extending our overall hours from 1 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. every fifth Wednesday to 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. every fifth Wednesday and on the 32nd day of every month.ù† Furthermore, C.A.P.S. therapists will begin to have more impactful conversations with patients, giving advice like: Have you tried to take a walk outside?ù; Could you try to tell yourself a funny joke?ù; Did you already sit in the egg chair?ù; and, In the grand scheme of things, you actually don't have it that bad.ù† The initiative is receiving new patients, many of whom have been waiting years for C.A.P.S. care. After telling my therapist what was going on with me, the first thing she asked was, òAre you sure you're sad, or maybe you're just PMSing?'ù student Ethan Hernandez said. C.A.P.S. officials have also voiced their excitement with the See the Sunny Side!ù campus-wide posters, to be erected whenever the therapy session waitlist frees up. The posters, five 8-by-11-inch black-and-white printer papers, read don't be blue, be happy instead,ù with a lovely addition of a stock photo flower.† We're really looking forward to furthering our crucial role here on campus,ù Peterson stated while pinning one of the five posters onto a wall of Webb Hall's basement. It's hard work, but someone's gotta do it.ù† † Emma Demorest went to C.A.P.S. once and they told her she was actually fine!†

Who's there? It's your cerebral cortex, silly! Give your ol' dome a couple of hearty taps with your knuckles to make sure that little rascal is still rattling around in there. Your brain is going to be very important for these next steps, so you want to make sure it's sitting safe and sound at home. If it turns out your brain has gone missing and you're in need of a new one, meet me behind Buchanan. I know a guy.† † †  Step 2: Find yourself Choo choo! Looks like our train is pulling into the Meditation Station! A clear mind and a healthy mindset are your two best weapons when approaching the spelling of any word, especially one with this many syllables! When your mind is clear of negative thoughts born from failed spelling tests and embarrassing spelling bee performances, there's no brain baggage holding you back from nailing those vowels! † †  Step 3: Go paleo Uh oh, our train seems to have taken a wrong turn. We're in your small intestine! When it comes to mental acuity, a healthy gut ecosystem is just as important for your brain as a good night's sleep! Get those filthy grains out of here, I don't wanna see them! Dairy? Never heard of her! Meat's on the menu tonight! A paleo diet is the perfect way to bring your digestive system back to the glory of the Paleolithic era and get that gut ecosystem flourishing. (P.S. For a word as big as this, it's recommended you start the paleo diet two weeks in advance to give your body ample time to flush out the grain juju.) †  Step 4: Hype yourself up! Hey champ! You got this! Confidence is key, and you're going to need all the confidence you can get before you approach this challenge. Get your hair done, spend a little more time on your makeup, let some Tinder boys desperately throw compliments your way in an attempt to get into your pants; whatever you need to do! We also suggest practicing spelling some smaller words in the mirror. Be careful not to get too ambitious, however. You don't want to blow your six-syllable load before you get to the main event! †  Step 5: Spell Nexustentialism You've done all the prep you can possibly do, and you're finally ready. Pick out your favorite pencil and some nice stationary, light a couple candles and sit down in a comfortable chair. Now, slowly but surely, put those pesky letters down: N-E-X-U-S-T-E-N-T-I-A-L-I-S-M. Boom! I knew you could do it. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done, champ!† † Chace Duma fears no man; he does, however, fear six-syllable words.

This revelation has sent shockwaves throughout campus as the ideal image of the once-beloved chancellor has now been shattered by the cold, hard reality of his unscrupulous dealings. Students everywhere are lamenting the previously untarnished reputation of their cherished chancellor in the light of recent events revealing him to be nothing more than a corporate shill. Innocence never lasts, does it? Is there one good man left in this accursed realm we inhabit?ù one student wailed into the abyss off the edge of Campus Point. Representatives from the Chancellor's office have declined to comment on the contributions of chain-link fence lobbyists to the funding of projects conducted by the administration, though they did recently release a statement on the issue that read as follows:
 Chancellor Yang and the Office of the Chancellor believe the implementation of these fences are integral to the protection of UCSB students from the dangers associated with the òlitness' of Halloween activities. Additionally, these barriers will serve as protection from a variety of dangerous fauna commonly found in the Isla Vista area, including (but not limited to): murderous mountain lions, rabid raccoons and perilous possums.ù The statement went on to describe UCSB students as often drunk idiotsù and that the fences served dual roles by keeping students in and keeping [Halloween spirit] out.ù Yang himself allegedly ordered the erection of additional fencing all the way down the median of El Colegio Road under the pretense of preventing FT residents from drunkenly jaywalking, even though it's abundantly clear that nobody in FT has both alcohol to consume and addresses to cross the street in pursuit of. While the reputation of our highly esteemed chancellor is tragically forever tainted, Yang still stands for many as a shining beacon of wholesome leadership despite his transgressions. Daddy [Yang] is a ride or die,ù one student said of the matter. In my eyes, he can do no wrong.ù † Max Myszkowski would die for Chancellor Yang if asked to do so. Comments are closed.

Autumn is here, and the petri dish of Isla Vista is ready to deliver its infamous speciality: UCSB flu season. If you have somehow managed to evade the horseman of pestilence thus far, here are some tips and tricks for getting through the rest of this god-forsaken era. † This first strategy to tackle flu season acts as a deterrent. When the flu sees your dedication to defending your belongings, your ironclad commitment will give off an aura intimidating enough to scare the flu off completely. † † † † 2. Stream Taylor Swift's Loverù on Spotify and Apple Music No one can be hostile while listening to some funky tunes, and the flu is no exception. Taylor Swift's new album is sure to help the flu forget all about its obligations to plague you! Just pull up your streaming service of choice and let the queen of pop do your work for you. † † † †3. Make a Shitty Meme After getting brutally and mercilessly meme'd, the flu will be so embarrassed that it will have no choice but to leave you alone. † † † †4. Get a Hobby, You Sad Man If you really want to distract your flu, give it a hobby. Subsequently, your diseased companion will gain a newfound sense of purpose. It'll eventually realize that trying to put down others is a temporary solution to a long-term internal issue that needs to be addressed through healthy, productive means. I recommend learning a new instrument or taking up fishing. † † † † 5. Tell the Flu to Knock It Off If all else fails, bully the flu into leaving you alone. I usually find that a good, stern warning shows the flu that you mean business, especially if accompanied by an indignant fist-shaking. † Sierra Vakili thinks the flu is too mainstream, so she has decided to contract rabies instead.

Based on what I know about pre-heat death history, my transporter must have malfunctioned and taken me into the world of some poorly written post-apocalypse novel.ù K·ï¨llens·¢±th only grew more confused when it was confirmed that this was in fact the central coast of California in the 21st century rather than fictionalized war-ravaged mid 20th century Eurasia. But what about all the fences and the huge police presence?ù asked K·ï¨llens·¢±th. In response, the Isla Vista community just shrugged.

Trigger your crush's fight-or-flight response with this scary costume î and when they realize they're not being mauled, they'll fall right into your arms ¶ erm, paws? † † I think we can all agree î the chancellor we know and love absolutely oozes sex appeal. We all know that sex appeal is all about power, and that makes Big Daddyù Chancellor Henry Yang one of the sexiest men on campus (call me! XO). † † Storke screams sexy: it's a penis, people. Take a long, hard look at its beige beauty and tell me it isn't the sexiest piece of architecture on this side of the Mississippi. † † There's nothing sexier than mental health î or at least that's what my therapist tells me. This year, try channeling your inner Freud by making therapy sexier than ever! This costume is a breeze to put together: the top half gets a tweed sportcoat and a girthy cigar (to satisfy your oral fixation) and the bottom half gets nothing! † † Halloween is right smack in the middle of midterm season, so you can bet your sweet serotonin that ghouls and goblins aren't the only demons you're going to be dealing with this òWeen. And as my therapist also says: if you're going to be sad, at least make it sexy! † † Couple's costume alert! One partner goes as the beer, and the other as the die. Throw in a third member as the table if you're looking for a group costume for your polyamorous throuple. † † Bonus points if you go as both your iClicker and a friend's; academic dishonesty is for schmucks anyway, and there's no professors looking over your shoulder when you're walking the streets on All Hallows' Eve. Forgot to dress up for Halloween and you're already biking to class on the 31st? Worry not: a sharp turn into some nearby bushes, and you're ready to go! Remind your fellow commuters to wear their helmets by showing them the spooky side of cycling this Halloween! † † Truly a match made in heaven and arguably even one of the power couples of the century. Raccoons and dumpsters have gone hand in paw since the Isla Vista area was originally settled by their trash-panda ancestors. † † This one goes out to all the granolas and foot-fetishists here at UCSB. Think you've got arches to die for? The 31st is the night to show them off! If you're worried about stepping on a broken bottle and bleeding out, don't worry!

Thus, starting on Nov. 30, CALPIRG will launch the Carnage in the Arborù initiative, which will involve CALPIRG volunteers clubbing baby seals with their clipboards for every refusal their petitions get. You thought we were intolerable before?ù CALPIRG member Jerry Signer said with a crazed look in his eyes. You guys didn't like us trying to save the world, huh? Wait till we start killing baby seals, huh? How about that? You want that? You want blood everywhere on your hands?ù For many years, CALPIRG, an organization committed to standing up to powerful interests, has been known for aggressive strategies in getting students to join its cause. While its cause is certainly noble, some students only know CALPIRG for its volunteers' relentless advertising techniques. They are literally freaking everywhere,ù student Ricky Laybac said. I'm taking a nap on the library lawn, I wake up, they're there just staring at me. I go to the Arbor and buy a Yerb, they're in the fridge asking if I care about the rainforest. I take a dump on the sixth floor of the lib and they're reaching under asking me not to flush to save water. They are out of control. I'm always being watched. I tell them I'm late for class, but they know I'm lying. I see it in their eyes.ù This negative reputation has forced CALPIRG's hand in making sure the group is able to obtain the support it needs for their projects. We have no choice, okay?!ù Signer said. Everyone would ignore us or run away if we didn't do this. From this day forward, every single CALPIRG member must be armed with a clipboard in one hand and a cute little baby seal in another. No signature and it's bye-bye to lil' Seal Jr. The students will pay for their indifference to worthy causes. YOU HEAR ME? THE SEALS WILL PAY! LUCIFER WILL RISE! CALPIRG WILL BE STIFLED NO MORE!ù Local Police Chief Brett Oinkerson seems to disagree.

You'd be correct, as the capsized sailboat that has graced the shore for the past couple of weeks was finally salvaged. In contacting the university to see where our friend had gone, we were told it was being turned into a first-year living community.ù We're very excited about this new prospect,ù claimed Ryan Matey, head of the renovation project. It's such an incredible opportunity for innovation. A top-of-the-line, open-air, first-year living community is the way to the future for this university and will set us apart from our sister UCs. That's why we're doing this. Not to compensate for over-enrollment. I don't know why you'd think that.ù We weren't thinking that. When asked about these innovations,ù R. Matey gave us quite the astounding list, including open-air bathrooms on the poop deck.† Just imagine letting last night's Freebirds fly as you enjoy the cool ocean breeze on your upper thighs. What could be more pleasant than that? I'll tell you what. An indoor pool. In the living quarters! Some construction managers might call it òwaterlogged' or a òsinking ship,' but we prefer to turn that frown upside down and call it a pool.ù Matey claims the new living communityù will be brought to Coal Oil Point in time for next year's freshman class.

Sometimes, when you're already starting the pregame, it's too late to venture out into I.V. to actually buy some. We at Nexustentialism are here to bring you the best at-home alternatives to the classic Shasta lemon-lime soda you'd find at an I.V. house party. Hot dog water. Ever wonder what to do with your leftover hot dog water? Don't pour this succulent beverage down the drain; use it as chaser! Our hard liquor connoisseurs recommend pairing hot dog water with tequila to bring out the subtle meaty undertones.† Oat milk. Dairy? That is so out. Alternative milk is the wave î particularly oat milk. Almond and soy are okay but so 2018. Now that Caj√© and I.V. Drip are offering oat-y alternatives to lattes everywhere, why can't the tastemakers of I.V. lead the way with oat milk as the go-to for pregames everywhere? Crackers. Who said that chaser had to be a liquid? I can't even believe you would think that, you intolerant asshole. As palate cleansers, crackers serve a similar purpose with alcohol consumption. Don't want the taste of cheap vodka to linger in your mouth? Allow your dry, flaky crackers to suck up all of that excess alcohol. Pro tip: try the crackers next to the soup station at the Arbor.† A piece of fruit. It's practically juice. The leftover beans that your housemate left sitting in a pot on the stove. This is just a crime of opportunity, really.† Flavored vodka. You know how they say that you forget the pain of childbirth immediately after experiencing it due to your overwhelming love for your child? I imagine the same applies when you take a shot of Vitali and chase it with Peach New Am immediately afterward.† † Betty Cocker once yakked from simply smelling a shot of Vitali.†

This soggy conclusion to his midnight grind session was reportedly received with nothing but ecstatic glee from Schmoe. Oh goodie!ù Schmoe exclaimed upon noticing the dew-laden pleather seat.

Oh yeah, that's the stuff,ù Schmoe allegedly moaned as the waterlogged seat squelched under his tushie.† Schmoe's case is far from unique. Students from all across the university have shared in similar squelchy splendors on a nearly nightly basis.

My cup runneth over!ù one soggy-bottomed student proclaimed, appreciating the fact that the condensation from his seat had penetrated several layers of clothing, thoroughly soaking him from crotch to crack. Some student cyclists, who have no appreciation for the luxury of a soaked heinie, have taken to wiping their seats off with their shirts before embarking on their rides home, instead opting to enjoy the alternative (though far inferior) option of a moistened midriff.† It's 9:30 p.m., 45 degrees Fahrenheit outside, and I just got back from a four-hour chemistry lab,ù one student told Nexustentialism. I was just aching to get an ass crack full of evening dew to cap off my night.ù For those more moisture-averse students, several options exist for avoiding the superb glee associated with uncovering a thoroughly drenched bicycle seat.

Members of the United States Senate have reportedly expressed relief that the system of checks and balances implemented by the Founding Fathers actually does work after all. Wow, and here I was, thinking a binary, hyperpartisan political system could eventually lead to an unchecked, unhinged president who could commit whatever crimes he wanted as long as 35 senators supported him unconditionally,ù one relieved U.S. Senator said. CURSES! FOILED BY ASSOCIATED STUDENTS ONCE AGAIN!ù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shrieked upon hearing the results of the A.S. Senate vote. And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for those meddling kids!ù I mean, what did you expect î didn't you pay attention in AP Gov? Read the Constitution, why don't you?ù one A.S. Senator told Nexustentialism when asked how exactly the A.S. Senate acquired the powers to remove a sitting president from office. Faculty in the political science department were reportedly surprised and delighted at how easy the whole impeachment process was, telling Nexustentialism they couldn't have hoped for a smoother and more effective termination of Trump's presidency. Wow, I should have thought of that,ù political science professor Anne Harkee said. Glad that's out of the way.ù With the President of the United States finally removed from office by the innumerable and omnipotent powers of the A.S. Senate, the nation has breathed a collective sigh of relief and the A.S. Senators have returned to their usual schedule of playing tiny-government. At press time, Vice President Mike Pence could be sighted frantically muttering Hail Marys and flipping through the Good Book in search of passages he could try to add to the Constitution. Give me strength, dear Lord almighty î Mother and I are going to need it,ù Pence said. † Max Myszkowski writes FAKE NEWS! SAD!

This proved to be both a blessing and a curse for student Jake Gladstone, whose soul left his body sometime around his 10th Redbull last Monday. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but it failed to return, even after Gladstone completed his finals. ††I thought it would just come back like usual,ù Gladstone said. Last year, it left during a library all nighter when I was pouring Frito Dip into a bag of Doritos at 4 a.m., and it came back after my last final, when I had my first glass of water after about two weeks of straight yerb.ù† This year, however, Gladstone's soul seemed to have gotten lost.† Gladstone said he wasn't too worriedù until a week later when he received an email from UCSB economics professor Gary Marvitz saying he thought there may have been a mix up. It was the strangest thing,ù Marvitz told Nexustentialism. I was grading final papers and all of a sudden, I felt a cold rush of air, then the intense urge to find some nicotine. When I tried to ask my TA what was wrong with me, all that came out was òbruh.'ù Post-final soul mix ups are not common at UCSB, but they have occurred. Historical records date the last switch to 1968, when third-year student Nancy Brown's soul accidentally slipped into fourth-year student Mary Rogers, who was later able to return Brown's soul by sneezing it out.ù† Rogers would take this life experience as inspiration to fuel her original screenplay and subsequent hit, Freaky Friday.† Though Marvitz seems pretty happy with his additional youthful soul (noting that he's been able to drink more and increased bedroom stamina), Gladstone is still patiently waiting for it to come on out of there.† I dunno, maybe I'll try baiting it with a game of die or put on a good Joe Rogan podcast, my soul always seemed to like that stuff.ù† † Emma Demorest thinks it's not her fault that you don't get the Freaky Friday joke because you never watched a cinema classic.†

Simply put, we should all have a personal vendetta against this creamy, bullshit concoction designed to ruin the pristine delicacy that is an egg bagel.† It's like the goddamn Yoplait yogurt with the thick chunks of fruit inside; flavored cream cheese is a disappointment to its parents, to Satan and to whatever organization has hired it to spy on us. If I truly wanted to add a little something more to my bagel treat, which I often do, I would simply add the glam my goddamn self.† Trust me on this one; if you want your bagel to have the it factor, you can slap it on. Throw a damn tomato slice on there or give it a lil' touch of honey and cinnamon yourself î you're gonna be like a chef up in this bitch instead of that dude, who spent more on a product that he can use on fewer bagels. I don't need to spend two extra dollars just to limit my bagel options with flavored cream cheese. Let's be realistic here, who the fuck wants strawberry cream cheese on a jalape√±o bagel? At some point, we as civilized human beings need to draw the line. Tainting beautiful, natural cream cheese with brown sugar and cinnamon or Sriracha so that it sells better? Hard no. That would be like the food equivalent of telling a bro he needs to lift to get the ladies (and maybe lads, who am I to judge) and frankly I am not here for it.† Natural cream cheese never hurt us, so pray tell me why do we exist in a world where we must change who and what cream cheese is as a dairy product in order for it to be more palatable to the unrefined mouths of the reckless fools buying blueberry cream cheese?† C'mon, I.V. î and ahem, Bagel Cafe î I know we, as a caring, wholesome community, can take a stand against this awful, beastial creation and return to our roots of unadultered, plain-as-fuck cream cheese.

Wiessass'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/top-five-gaucho-resolutions/,"Max Myszkowski / Daily Nexus As the waters of 2019 evaporated to the relentless winds of time, many Gauchos saw themselves reflected in the puddles left behind and resolved to better themselves as they waded into the currents of 2020. Nexustentialism has curated the finest Gaucho New Year's resolutions from across campus and is delighted to share these resolutions which so perfectly capture the Gaucho spirit.  1. Stop Doing Cocaine† Many Gauchos we talked to are looking to curb their drug habits in the new year, wanting the only powder they see to be that on the slopes during winter break. Some Gauchos have come to the realization that their nose-candy habit may not be as sustainable as they once thought. Yeah, I realized all the rappers and singers I like could afford rehab if they needed it,ù local party boy, Schnoz Hoover, said. I figured I should stop while I can still write it off as a phase in college and before it becomes, like, an addiction.ù  2. Be More Environmentally Conscious† UCSB is one of the most environmentally conscious campuses in California, and this is due largely to student activism. In another push toward sustainability, many Gauchos are looking to do their part to lessen the carbon footprint of the UCSB and I.V. community.† One house on Pasado has looked to decrease imports of alcohol by distilling their own vodka. It kinda tastes like Dove Beauty bars and patchouli, and we've lost the use of our shower, but it is worth it to save the earth,ù said the SB bootlegger who wished to remain anonymous.  3. Start Working Out Again† Goddamn it! All of y'all are already so damn attractive! If y'all get any fitter, I will lose all bargaining power in the socio-sexual marketplace, and I just cannot afford that right now. I completely respect your fitness journey and everything, but please, when you super-fit Gauch-Bros are crushing puss and Gal-chos are getting that D, consider the rest of us and leave some leftovers.  4. Blackout Less† Our reputation as a party school is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but some Gauchos are looking to break this cycle. I'm definitely going to blackout once a week, it is just unavoidable,ù third-year student Allie K. Hollic said. But I am just hoping to get that number down there instead of my current four.ù  5. Be More Grateful† From time to time, we may all forget to give adequate thanks for the gifts and privileges that we enjoy on a daily basis. It is important not to let the hustle and bustle of a highly-ranked university lifestyle distract us from the wonders all around us. Some Gauchos are looking to reclaim their attention and display their gratitude toward those that deserve it the most.  † A. Wiessass has already repeated all of his past mistakes in the new year.

Not just anyone can apply, however. To obtain a position within the department, Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) asks that you be the absolute scum of the motherfucking Earth.† TPS director Linda Shillman stated that this is the most important factor in assembling an employee base. That's all we're really asking for,ù she said as Nexustentialism caught up with her in her office, with acid-green sludge dripping from her eye sockets. We really want students who can do this job well.ù It was then reported that Shillman took a live mouse out of her desk drawer and ate it with her forked tongue.† Hannah Jackson / Daily Nexus In a schoolwide email, TPS stated that applicants must find joy and fulfillment in tears, the pain of others, setting ants on fire with a magnifying glass and generally just ruining lives. I've been a TPS officer for a quarter now,ù student Ian Hoover stated. It has been an honor absolutely destroying someone's perfectly good day.ù Nexustentialism was lucky enough to be able to tag along with Hoover during his shift, where he wrote a $150 ticket for a car parked a minute after its expiration, put reservedù cones in front of all the available spots in Lot 22 for no reason at all and poked holes in tires for the fun of it.† It's really important that, on top of the thousands that students have to pay to go here, they know that the university is actively choking just a tiny bit more money out of them,ù Hoover noted while pissing on the windshield of a Subaru.† One of our more popular positions is the facilitator of appeals,ù Shillman added, after she'd swallowed that mouse from before. The position in question is stationed in a small, windowless room with nothing but a desk and a 1998 Windows computer that displays incoming appeals.† It's been one of my favorite jobs,ù current facilitator Sarah Tran said. All you have to do is decide whether to accept or decline the appeal, and there's actually no accept button. I love to read their pleas of mercy and just laugh and laugh and laugh.ù Nexustentialism noted that while watching her in action, Tran dipped singular pieces of cereal into a small cup of warm milk before eating them and, true to form, laughing maniacally. † This article is not related to the $48 parking ticket Emma Demorest graciously received. She is actively looking for ways not to pay it, if anyone knows how.

The results of the double-blind study, which have shaken the foundational assumptions made by many in the vaping community, have conclusively determined that over 90% of vapers are, indeed, mortal. We were honestly shocked,ù said one member of the research group conducting the study. We obviously expected one or two mortals to be included in our sample, but this is just unheard of.ù Many avid vapists have been reportedly taken aback by this news of their own truly ephemeral, transient nature, and the revelation that they soon, too, will be returned to the ground from which they came has soured the taste of even the mintiest of Juul pods. Representatives from vaping companies have declined to comment on the allegations of mortality that the results of this study seem to suggest. Though their websites do warn of the potentially addictive effects of nicotine-containing products, none of the websites investigated by Nexustentialism made any mention of the fleeting nature of our own existence. I think I need to sit down for a second,ù one Juuler said, taking a puff from his minty sidearm to steady his nerves after hearing that he, too, would one day be returned to the endless void of unconsciousness whence he came. Students across the university have been confronted with equal parts existential terror and betrayal, many switching back to cigarettes as their once-beloved, flavorful vapor literally and figuratively turned to ashes in their mouths. At least I know what the health consequences of cigarettes are!ù said a previous vaper who had recently made the switch to cigarettes and taken up residence in the smoking pits outside the library. Many vapers, now faced with the anguish and despair associated with the knowledge of the perishable nature of their corporeal forms, have sought respite from this sobering reality î some in God, others in nihilism î but all ultimately futile in their attempts to assuage their collective dread. Oh God, to un-know!ù one student's anguished wails rang out. To leave Plato's cave was a mistake î dear Lord Almighty, this burden I now must bear!ù Student Health has extensively warned students of the dangers of smoking and vaping, but their efforts have been to little avail, as the waiting time to be warned of these dangers is currently longer than what it takes to smoke enough to turn your lungs black. † Max Myszkowski will absolutely not hit your Juul, not even if you have a vintage mint pod.

Girvetz did not conceptualize herself as the princess who transforms but rather saw herself as the kitchen wench who didn't get to go to the ball in the first place. She was tired. Tired of pretentious TAs calling tech support when her projectors take a moment to warm up. Tired of frat boys spilling piss on her classic bathroom tiling. Tired of scribblings etched into her skin.

They will be automatically accepted into the Honors Program and also given a complimentary high-five for looking so damn cool.ù Students previously admitted to the program on the basis of their academic performance have reportedly been alloted a three-week grace period to pick up the no-handed cycling technique or will otherwise be dropped from the program. Some students have expressed distaste for these new qualifications, asserting that they are inherently elitist and disproportionately underrepresent students from non-cycling backgrounds, such as those preferring skateboarding, scootering or, god forbid, walking as their primary mode of transportation. Yeah that's been the point the whole time. Maybe put some miles on your pedals and then we'll talk,ù the Honors Program replied in response to these allegations. Students who can ride a Lime scooter with no hands will be granted provisional acceptances to the program on the basis that they begin training hands-free cycling before the end of the quarter. Students who can bike one-handed will be allowed to remain in the program if previously admitted based on academics, though they will be required to pass a written exam on the badassery of living dangerously. Look Ma, no hands!ù one Honorable cyclist shouted before veering off the bike path and into some nearby shrubbery. This was momentarily followed by a weak, though clearly strained I'm ok.ù Conversely, students who ride their bikes with both hands and also wear helmets while doing so will be dropped from the university entirely. † Max Myszkowski has crashed his bike four times this year, all hands-free.

It really meant a lot to everyone there that he acknowledged the accident and had it in his thoughts as he swiftly biked away from the scene.ù One student involved in the wreck bemoaned the lack of help from bystanders, but it's important to note that the accident occurred at 10:50 a.m. î otherwise known as peak rush hour î and a perfectly acceptable reason for a man of Fygel's great character to abstain from actions greater than a hurried condolence. Oh no I didn't even have class. I just was just mad hungover and really wanted Jamba Juice and Panda Express from the UCen.ù Fygel said.

There are a lot of distinctive pieces of land on the UCSB campus: Storke Tower, South Hall, the area around the lagoon. Yet, nothing really compares to the musty pile of shit that is Buchanan Hall. Let's talk about the close proximity of seating in Buchanan that brings its students together through PTSD-inducing experiences. As the famous saying goes, First base is kissing, second base is involuntarily shoving your ass in someone's face while trying to get to your seat in Buchanan.ù In order to avoid these awkwardly intimate moments, students constantly set up residence in the aisles adjacent to Buchanan's seating areas despite an abundance of seats available in the middle of each row. Students would rather have their buttocks go numb from sitting on the floor than venture into a journey filled with excuse me,ù I'm so sorryù and I apologize profuselyù as they scoot their ways to empty seats in the middle of the rows.

I was wrong ìì so, so wrong.ù The Buchanan bathrooms provide what could politely be described as a spinning roulette wheel of surprises. One day you could find the toilet paper rolls soaked, the next day the urinals overflowing or if you're really lucky: a solitary turd resting on the dirty, linoleum floor. The one bright spot of this intolerable experience is the Buchanan store, which provides nourishment and shelter from within the lecture hall's walls. However, even this positive is minimal, as the store barely edges out the handicapped stall in terms of square footage. Despite the trials and tribulations the Buchanan experience provides, it is clear that Buchanan Hall and the UCSB student body need each other to thrive. Students need to graduate, and the hall needs students to be sacrificial lambs to fuel the dark evil that lurks in the Buchanan shadows. I have been a devout Christian my whole life and prayed everyday that the two classes I need to graduate would not be in Buchanan,ù Laybac said. Long story short, I am now an atheist.ù † Kian Karamdashti is fighting his Buchanan demons every Monday and Wednesday this Winter Quarter.

But, getting ghosted by the guy who works at the University Center (UCen) Starbucks is a whole other experience. The person who, just yesterday, drew a heart on your Slow-Roasted Ham, Swiss & Egg Breakfast Sandwich now refuses to acknowledge your existence and dumped you without so much as an explanation text. You're devastated, I get it. So here is some advice to keep you from making a fool out of yourself.† No matter how many times you frequent the Bank of America ATM, he is not going to text you back. If anything, he is going to question why you linger around the ATM so much, and never actually withdraw any money. No one in the UCen is fooled when you feign frustration because your pin was denied for the third time that day, they just feel sorry for you. I know it can be addicting to track him on Snap Map, and then conveniently find yourself in the same location as him. But keep in mind, he has a general idea of your schedule and knows that you don't have any classes in Girvetz. So, what you intended as being an accidental meet-up where he realizes he made a mistake and begs for you back, has actually just made him consider a restraining order. Do not, and I repeat, do not go buy something from the UCen Starbucks. This one should be obvious, but you shouldn't confront him at his place of work. Not only will you embarrass yourself, but your feelings will be even more hurt, especially when he pretends he doesn't know you and puts the wrong name on your drink. I don't care how bad you are craving a caramel macchiato, walk your ass to the Starbucks in I.V. and save yourself some dignity. This one kind of speaks for itself. The way to get over someone is by getting under someone else, and at least the guy that works at Jamba Juice won't charge you for a drink. Just make sure you don't get ghosted by him too. † Devi S.

Whether you prefer the classic clam chowder or the zesty Timberline Chili, you will forget all about flavored Juul pods when you load up your vape with these chemically active stews. Unfortunately, EBT does not cover this vape juice. Mojo Boba† For those that like to chew their tea, Mojo has introduced a way to chew your vape with boba e-juice. My personal favorite is the taro tea vape juice with extra boba. I don't even miss the nicotine while I am distracted by my jaw's campaign to conquer those little tapioca balls. TA Tears Much like the tears of leprechauns or fairies, the tears of TAs have magical properties. It is said that if you can capture the tears of a grad student in your vape cartridge, you will be endowed with the power to see the future, an exhaustive knowledge of all of their area of study and î if you pick the right TA î eternal life. Lagoon Water Now, we aren't sure that the lagoon contains nicotine, but it seems plainly ignorant to claim that there isn't a fuck ton of addictive chemicals mixed into the water. Think of all the runoff from the dining commons, the refuse deposited in the lagoon by indiscriminate freshman and the sweat from the rowing team. Lagoon water may not get you domed, but it'll certainly knock you on your ass. † A.Wiessass only vapes free-range egg yolk.

In regard to shivering and shuddering when exposed to the icy air of El Greco Road, Thompson said, it's just inconvenient. So I don't do it.ù Thompson has been making waves throughout UCSB, leading the pack for un-cold hoes everywhere. Her inspiration has influenced several hoes thus far, including Anna Lopez, 21, who genetically modified her nerve endings to numb out cold temperatures; McKenna James, 20, a cold-blooded reptile; and Eliza Howard, 18, who is just from Colorado and thinks this is nothingù and that you're all weak.ù† Honestly, it's just a mindset,ù Thompson added, unflinchingly submerging herself into an ice bath. If you really want your òendless summer' dreams to come true, you have to act the part. I don't even own any clothing with sleeves, really.ù Sleeved hoes across campus have met Thompson's mindset with skepticism.† You can still be a hoe in a sweater, right? Like, a cute cropped sweater? Maybe? Right?ù stuttered second-year Madeline Layman through gritted teeth, profusely rubbing her arms to generate some meager warmth through friction. However, Layman's final statement to Nexustentialism spoke volumes on behalf of the entire Isla Vista hoe community: I fucking hate winter quarter.ù† † Sierra Vakili shows less skin in the winter than a Utah sister-wife.

For second-year student Emma Fahler, this accumulation of waffle slop serves as a not-so-tender reminder that she can't do a single thing right.† Why can't just one thing be easy?ù said Fahler in regards to her spectacularly disappointing waffle making performance. I could've just gone for pancakes. I should've just gone for pancakes, but here we are.ù Fahler told Nexustentialism that she took this matter to heart, as if the escaping waffle batter was an insult from the waffle machine itself and not a product of her own culinary incompetence.  Fahler's disastrous morning, however, is not an isolated incident. Waffle-related difficulties have been pushing students to the brink of psychological hysteria for weeks, according to one anonymous Ortega employee. It's like they're being pushed to their limits.

Day after day, waffle after waffle î it never gets easier to watch.ù† In response to recent events, UCSB Housing, Dining & Auxiliary Enterprises (HDAE) proposed a complete removal of self-serve waffle machines in the dining commons.

He has had no luck thus far, but he hopes someone will take the bait soon so that he can finally put on shoes and drop the charade of pretending he's not disgusted when he steps on a bug, twig or rock. If things don't go as expected, Graham's next meaningless endeavor to draw publicity might include a piercing he'll regret in two weeks, wearing weed socks or switching to the economics major for a quarter just to say that he did.

As a result, all restrooms on campus are officially off limits to students.ù UCSB faculty is, as of now, on thin fucking ice,ù the statement later continued. Some students have criticized this new poop-prohibitive policy as an overreaction to the Buchanan incident, arguing that it's all gotta go somewhere,ù and that the lack of restroom access would simply drive students to defecate elsewhere, such as in the Storke Plaza pond or in the smoking pits outside the library. Administrators have clarified that, until a suspect for the Buchanan vandalism incident has been taken into custody, students are to hold in their excretions until they leave campus, and that anyone caught defecating or urinating on campus will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. There have currently been no suspects apprehended for the Buchanan vandalism incident, though police did contact Nexustentialism for comment on the issue, graciously recognizing us as the local bathroom connoisseurs we've been trying to brand ourselves as for so long.

Wiessass / Daily Nexus DAVIDSON LIBRARY î Reports have surfaced that the long-dormant eldritch monster residing under Davidson Library has grown restless due to a burgeoning hunger that can no longer be sated by our measly tithes. Experts are unsure why the monster has grown dissatisfied as of late. Some suggest the debauchery of Isla Vista may have been taken as an affront to His Dark Holiness' capability for earth-shaking destruction, while others have posited this is simply the next step in the monster's evolution and was ultimately unavoidable. Maintenance workers in Davidson have reported that the growls from the monstrosity's secret floor ìì usually drowned out by students' study music ìì have become inescapable, haunting them not only as they remain within the facilities, but long after they clock off. At press time, workers reported that the monster's din emanated not from behind his chamber door, but seemingly from deep within their own minds. Our offerings have grown insufficient. We can no longer satisfy its primordial hunger; our doom is imminent,ù said Beherit Bartis, keeper of the monstrosity. It was previously content with raccoons and jackrabbits, but it has learned of man's folly and now requests more than I can offer,ù he continued. Chancellor Yang has met with experts in the field of monsterology in search of answers on how to quell the monster's bloodlust. Yang has even reportedly held multiple s√©ances attempting to reach the spirit of Donald C. Davidson, for whom the library is named, in search of answers as to how to appease the abomination. All available information has suggested that Yang's efforts have been to no avail. With this looming threat bearing down over campus, many students have considered evacuating; however, Bartis told the Nexus that this would be a futile effort. He relayed a note from the monster, left in blood on the walls of the Davidson basement walls that read, Foolish mortals, I know not space, I know not time; I will go to the edges of your temporal plane to reap the souls that I have sowed. I am inescapable. I am doom incarnate.ù No word has yet been issued as to whether this news will affect class schedules. † A.

I realized I had to do them a huge favor.ù†† In an administration full of surprises, this has only been the latest unexpected development. Anonymous sources have indicated that Trump got the idea to solve one generation's debt problem by allowing them to indebt their offspring after one of his advisors explained to him how Social Security works. †The program will not only offer students a new way to relieve themselves of debt, but will also allow them flexibility in choosing how they sign away their children's futures. The burden can fall exclusively on the first-born child or, as long as the student has more than one child, it can be divided among them. Do you want to motivate your children to succeed by playing favorites? The program will allow for that too, as parents will be able to allocate their debt however they see fit, until their children turn 18.† In today's economy, parents are increasingly often finding themselves unable to leave an inheritance for their children. Fortunately however, the threat of crippling debt will be an effective new way to incentivize good behavior.† When reached for comment, Robert O' Brien, Trump's national security advisor, was effusive in his praise of Trump's policy decision.† It's a great day to be an American. I have always said the best solution to the national security challenges that we face is having more Americans. Now that student debt will compel young people to have children instead of discouraging them from doing so, we will continue to have the supply of bodies we need to maintain global order.ù The new deferral program will certainly contribute to the continued preeminence of the U.S. military. Children who find themselves on the receiving end of the debt their parents accrued with abandon will be able to have it forgiven if they enlist.† At a time when falling birth rates in highly developed countries are threatening their national security and economic stability, this program will make the combination of an educated populace and out-of-control population growth more than just a pipe dream. At the very least, it was an act of procrastination executed with a deftness that would make any college student proud, the repercussions from which we won't have to concern ourselves with for decades.† Chance Hope is excited for his fertile loins to finally do some good for this world.

In response to UCSC's Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) movement, UCSB graduate students are not only supporting the original movement but are also petitioning for their own COLA. Starting early Friday on Feb. 21, students occupied Cheadle Hall until midnight. The movement has grown in controversy after UC President Janet Napolitano threatened consequencesù for the UCSC graduate students participating in the protest. The movement has been met by overall support from the student body.† I think the protest is totally rad,ù said local bro and mountain party organizer Chad Brohanski. In a show of support from the student population, a mountain party had taken place on the top floor of Cheadle Hall. The mountain party had two different stages, with five acts each starting at 7 p.m. and going until midnight. The Cheadle Hall bathrooms were also reportedly accessible. I just really vibe with what the graduate students are doing, you know?ù said Brohanski. I wanted to show my support and thought the place needed some tunes and beep boops. It was a beautiful coming together of political protests, ecstasy, shrooms and the right to party on a living wage.ù Mountain parties have become a growing phenomenon in the UCSB community in the last year. While the location in the Santa Ynez Mountains is constantly changing, students have been driving up the mountain in droves for a night of music and camaraderie till the early sunrise. Unfortunately, this edition of the mountain party in Cheadle Hall was shut down at midnight due to IVPD's tyrannical midnight curfew.† In a prepared statement, Napolitano has stated: Any students that were found to have been vibing at the protest or mountain party will be punished to the fullest severity of the law.ù It's sad. It's disappointing,ù Brohanski said. We just want to party and protest without getting a noise ordinance.ù † Raffi Torres thinks Janet Napolitano should pay our graduate students!

Wiessass / Daily Nexus UCSB's entire campus has been left reeling this week following the shocking discovery that CALPIRG's turtle mascot has actually been a tortoise this whole time. I truly don't know what to believe anymore,ù student Erin Dewey sighed. After such a fundamental truth in my life has ended up being a hoax, it's hard to believe anything is real.ù The mascot for the plastic-free seas campaign was exposed last week when, during CALPIRG's notorious quarterly pledge drive, aquatic biology major Marina Bile took a second to examine the turtle.ù I just saw the chelonian and thought, òTurtles are water-dwelling, what's this one doing on land?' Then it hit me. The bent legs, the absolute size of it ìì that's not a turtle at all.ù Bile elaborated with an important detail: Turtles usually have webbed feet with claws, but this mascot clearly had Nike socks with Skechers. Dead giveaway.ù It seems that a large part of why the tortoise has gone so long without being discovered is due to everyone's basic human instinct to avoid CALPIRG pledgers at all costs. However, this doesn't account for the impersonator fooling its peers; even CALPIRG's own Cristina Gomez admitted that she had no idea. To think, I've spent years canvassing and tabling side by side with this ¶ this tortoise!ù Gomez scoffed in disgust.

Now that I look back on the quarter, it makes a lot of sense,ù recalled Gillian Gillù Able, a student in Charlie's section. In addition to his unsteady saunter into the classroom, typically knocking over desks on his journey to the forefront of the teaching vessel, He always spread out a bunch of garbage on the front table òas a snack,'ù according to Able. There was just an abnormal amount of hissing involved in discussion, but no one ever really questioned it. Y'know, because no one asks questions about anything in section.ù† SSSsssSsSSSSSSsssssSSs,ù the raccoons indignantly hissed in unison when asked about the COLA movement. SsssSSSsssSSsssSsSsss.ù† UCSB faculty denied Nexustentialism's request for an interview but added that they still defend the credentials of the raccoon gang, despite their refusal to offer the mischievous mammals a living wage.† The raccoon octet plans to participate in the strike against the UC system on Thursday in support of a living wage for all graduate students. Charlie Tan is set to finish off the quarter as a TA and is likely to return for spring quarter, as anonymous comments from students have revealed their teaching style to be surprisingly better than average,ù noting that [their] expectations were low to begin with.ù † Sierra Vakili believes all raccoons deserve a living wage.

The UCSB sociology department defines a clout drought as a lack of influence and/or trendsetting power, such as a lack of drip or insufficient amounts of swag.ù This state of emergency was declared by California's Clout Protection Agency. Gauchos were shocked to receive this news. We have so much clout, what are you talking about?ù asked frat star Brad Stiles.† Me and my boys have enough drip for the whole campus,ù said Stiles, gesturing to himself and his boys,ù who were decked out in Vineyard Vines, Sperrys and Abercrombie jorts.

The roar deafened I.V. residents and shattered windows as far as the 68 block.† The massive plume of superheated gas from the engines instantly vaporized the KCSB headquarters that were previously residing under the tower. The adjacent Daily Nexus headquarters were fortunately left unscathed, presumably on account of the staff's ritual sacrifices routinely made to appease the tower.† Dude, it was so beautiful. A melancholy moment, but I'm glad Storkey can finally be free.

Following the initial launch, Storke Tower flew 40 miles into the mesosphere before turning back and taking a few victory laps around the Earth. A low flyby shattered every window in Cal Poly before Storke set off to chase the sunset, skimming low above the Pacific and boiling a thin layer of the ocean into an impromptu seafood stew as it went.† Following its brief but storied world tour, Storke returned to UCSB, circling above the campus thrice before turning its Juul-esque belfry toward the sky and the stars. The streets of Isla Vista, the Arbor and the smouldering remains of Storke Plaza were crowded with students and faculty, all waving their bittersweet goodbyes to UCSB's most treasured phallic landmark.

Following a brief pause and some fervent deliberation between UC regents, it was then clarified that the COLA is to be paid entirely in Gaucho Bucks. Graduate students at UC Santa Cruz, who instigated the rapidly growing COLA movement, have been stunned by this decision. After celebrating this momentous victory for grad student quality of life, many paused momentarily to ask, Wait, what the fuck is a Gaucho Buck?ù We have heard your demands, graduate students of the UC system. We understand and resonate with your plight,ù said UC President Janet Napolitano.† Thus, we have graciously decided to ease your burden by increasing graduate student wages by $1,807.51 Gaucho Bucks per month.ù Graduate students at UC Santa Barbara have responded to this announcement with both excitement and confusion, many calling this development almost what we wanted.ù We hope this Gaucho Buck stipend î which will be accepted by the Arbor, the Bookstore and zero landlords î will ease the burden borne by these integral members of the university.ù Plans are also allegedly in the works to supplement this COLA with unused meal swipes from the Ortega Dining Commons.† This would be kind of like a solution to our problem,ù said UCSB graduate student Amy Pennyworth.

Wiessass / Daily Nexus BREAKING î UCSB researchers focusing on the cognition of education have published a new report concluding that college freshmen who start using stimulant drugs such as Adderall as a study aid for classes early in their academic careers, like GE and intro classes, are fucking weaklings who would run away sniveling when faced with the harsh realities of life.ù This report has been spreading across campus, with many feeling personally attacked by its findings. Those scientists are being totally, totally unfair! Some of these intro classes are really hard,ù said freshman linguistics major John Neidapil. Like, I'm taking Dinosaurs right now, and it's a lot of freaking work!ù he continued, with tears welling in his eyes and his baby face quivering from the trauma of having to face a depiction of himself that differed from the perfect little boyù that his mom told him he was. The researchers that worked on this report have responded to this outcry from students who feel targeted by its findings by stating: Waa! Waa! Wittle babies can't take being confwonted by weawity? Our report simply functions as a mirror that is showing you a side of yourself that you have, up until now, refused to acknowledge. All your reasons to hate the mirror are really just reasons to hate the person reflected in it.ù The researchers continued, you don't need Adderall like someone with ADHD needs it. What you need is a reevaluation of yourself and to ask yourself if you really belong here if you need recreational drugs just to fucking study.ù Local Adderall dealers reported a momentary downturn in the illicit prescription drug market, which was quickly followed by a spike in sales î likely attributable to students wanting to make up for lost productivity during their respite of self-reflection. Regardless of the report and its findings, it seems obvious that Adderall will continue being a mainstay in freshman dorms and the University Library alike. Jittery Gauchos will continue to try to make up for dilly-dallying for the rest of the quarter by staying up all night with the help of some friendly, little amphetamine. Orange dust stains their desks from splitting pills, but a seeping feeling of inadequacy is what stains their souls. A Wiessass consumes Adderall like a toddler consumes multivitamin gummies.

The interaction I had with the infected individual was brief, and the probability of transmission is incredibly low,ù Cruz said in an exclusive interview with Nexustentialism. However, the popularity of my continued removal from the general population is simply too great to ignore.ù It is currently unclear as to whether or not Cruz has been actively transmitting the virus, though individuals exposed to Cruz have consistently reported headaches and feelings of nausea over the last 49 years.

This is truly unprecedented,ù a local health official said. This is a phenomenon that will change the world forever.ù In the past week, we have seen a rising trend of Instagram challenges. This trend has coincided with a period of time in which much of the globe has participated in social-distancing or quarantining in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. These Instagram challenges typically encompass some sort of quarantine-related activity, such as juggling a toilet paper roll like a soccer ball or taking a picture of your friend group on a Zoom call together with a glass of wine in the frame. After you post your challenge, you are then obliged to nominate a few of your friends to continue the trend. Yet, one challenge seems to not have anything to do with any type of quarantine: the push-up challenge. Not going to lie, I wasn't even nominated by anyone,ù said local student Chad Brohanski. I just wanted that baddie Becky from the 65 block to see that I'm able to do 24 pushups in a row. She just followed me back on Instagram, so I took my shirt off and went for it.ù While this specific challenge was expected to result in a growing number of gym bros flocking to Instagram to show off their physical prowess, another consequence has arisen î the decline of confirmed COVID-19 cases.† To be honest, I saw three of my homies post the challenge on their instagram, and I decided I didn't even want to break quarantine to hang out with them anymore,ù said local student Barney Cuthbery. COVID-19 already took Deltopia away from me. I won't let my douchebag friends take away my pride.ù Even females have virtually stopped going outside because of this growing trend of males doing push-ups on Instagram. I honestly thought he was really cute and was going to break quarantine for Chad,ù said Becky Swanson. But then I saw him post a video of him on the ground of his dirty room doing push-ups, and I lost all attraction. I'm staying inside.ù With the correlation established, even Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has endorsed the challenge. Stay inside, wash your hands and keep doing the push-up challenge.

As college students, we have classes and lives and therefore, do not have time to stand outside Costco at 7 a.m. hoping to finally get that precious TP six-pack. That is why I have provided a handy guide to toilet paper alternatives during these catastrophic times. Why did you not think of this earlier! CVS already gives a yard of paper for three freaking items, so why not use it to your advantage? Just take your empty toilet paper rolls and reroll that 4-foot-long receipt for that time you purchased one bottle of shampoo.† Let's face it, you know you have at least 20 bags stashed somewhere. No one brings their own bag when you can buy one for 10 cents. You also can't use your own bags at grocery stores, so there's your new six-pack. No one has read or will ever read this paper, so why not just buy a copy or two and rip strips off when you need them? You can support the print media while saving the environment, so it's a win-win. You already pee in the shower, so that takes care of number one. For number two, just get down in there, do what you need to, then waffle stomp it down like the animal you know you have become.† Now that the 10-pack of scantrons and blue books you bought last quarter and will not use for 6 months can be put to good use. Just stay safe down there around the edges î they are sharp. If you have no toilet paper and refuse to buy some or degrade yourself to the other options, just use your God-given two-in-one napkin and utensil. Just, maybe do a second pass with washing up before you leave the bathroom.† Unless you are going to wear it, wipe with it. It is so cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. Wash it with the rest of your towels at the end of the week, it's that easy. Or, if your ex asked for it back, don't. † Chuck Mannsly doesn't need toilet paper, his BM's just slide right out.†

Ordinarily, the spring quarter is rung in by slammin' beers with the boys, throwing up in strangers' yards and blacking out at 11 a.m., but this year, a global pandemic had other plans for our bender-hungry Gauchos. But in the name of all that is holy, we will NOT forsake our Fireball-fueled functions and Smirnoff-sustained street soir√©es, damn it! So this year, the annual festivities were relocated to the remote conferencing service app Zoom.† Zoomtopia got off to a rough start: Many attendees could not figure out how to access the conference, or perhaps spent the first half of their days immobilized by crushing depression caused by the cancellation of their most precious holiday and sole source of joy. Either way, there were only, like, five people in the conference at first, and it was super awkward.† Things eventually did pick up. By noon, there were several hundred inebriated Zoomers, each playing their own mix of shitty EDM in the background, mingling harmoniously to sound not unlike the seventh circle of hell. For authenticity, some of the conference members used pictures of Del Playa as their Zoom backgrounds, and one wise guy even used a picture of a cop car! A reported $69,420 worth of damages to electronics were caused in the pandemonium, the primary cause being overzealous first-year students yakking on their laptops.† It was totally awesome,ù third-year student Lou Zerr said. Best party of the year, got soooooooo wasted dude, total rager,ù Zerr said before vehemently assuring Nexustentialism reporters that this was definitely not the first party he had ever gotten into.† But not everyone was satisfied with the results of Zoomtopia. It's just not the same,ù weeped second-year student Derrick Dunce. If we don't have Deltopia, what do we have? It's the only reason I'm going to this school,ù Dunce choked through violent sobs, saying nothing of the university's top-10 ranking or famous ocean views.† Though Zoomtopia perhaps varied from the original Deltopia in terms of litnessù and swag,ù it brings comfort to learn that in these crazy times, one thing remains constant: Gauchos consume copious amounts of alcohol.† † Auta Towner tried joining Zoomtopia, but someone kept muting her ):

I've already texted all of my exes, even the one that cheated on me! That's when you know it's bad,ù Varelli confidently declared, as if texting her boyfriend-who-wasn't-her-boyfriendù wasn't infinitely more embarrassing.

We spoke with one Isla Vista resident, Katie Hudson, about her brave struggle to clean her workspace and classroom materials for the remote spring quarter, even though they will rarely be used. In situations like these, it's better to be safe than sorry,ù Hudson explained. I'll probably be working at my desk, like, one hour a week, but cleaning everything made me feel really productive.ù† Hudson said cleaning and getting prepared was an enriching activity on its own, like when she found out she was apparently taking Psychology 1 after wiping down the textbook for it (I totally forgot I bought that, it seemed like a million years ago!ù). However, she knows she'd learn more things if she read them rather than looked at the pretty pictures on the covers. Hudson is taking a biology class this quarter but has not started on any of the work because she feels she has a good enough knowledge of how science worksù based on following the CDC's preventative measures. I'm pretty sure there's a unit on bacteria and viruses too, and I'm like, òHello?' Work smarter, not harder, obviously. I pay attention to the news updates on Twitter, so I'm basically the new Dr. Fauci,ù she said. In addition to not showing up to Zoom lectures, she's opting out of assignments (What if I have to respond to a discussion post by a classmate that has coronavirus? That would be, like, really scary.ù) and will be using Google for most of her open-book exams. Hudson is proud of her other intensive preventative efforts, like wiping down pencils she will forget how to write with by June, disinfecting a planner that, let's be honest, is not helping anyone right now and citing social distancingù as a reason to not do simple chores like walking her dog. Some might say Hudson is a bad student, but Nexustentialism looks on the bright side of things. At least she's lowering the spread by staying inside and using her phone for eight hours a day. It's a good thing she isn't risking her life by opening a textbook that, who knows, a rogue infected Amazon worker might've licked up and down. † Sam Franzini wishes to live the carefree life of Katie Hudson, if only for a day.

Wiessass / Daily Nexus † With the world all topsy-turvy, you might be looking for someone to guide you in wasting money, especially since many Isla Vista residents will be getting some government-provided fuck-aroundù funds. 1.About 200 I.V. Bagel Caf√© Egglesù Bagel Caf√© is the spiritual heart of Isla Vista, so we here at Nexustentialism feel there is no better way for a Gaucho to spend their IRS endowment than on 196 of their most average menu item. I'm not sure who exactly wants this many egg-centric bagel sandwiches, but thanks to the government's pitiful attempt at personal economic stabilization, they are currently within your grasp. There are far better menu items at this same price point, but the Eggle seemed fitting because it is probably better as a unit of measurement than as a food item. 2.Forty Eighths of Shitty I.V. Weed Although most of us have access to higher-quality pot, nothing feels more like home than a very midù eighth from this guy you met in the dorms during freshman year. And if that feels like home, how about feeling like home 40 times over? Besides, there's nothing like reinvesting in your community by supporting local businesses! 3.Nothing, Because Your Parents Claim You as a Dependant Oh, you don't file your own taxes? That's so embarrassing. You know it takes like 20 minutes, like, what's your excuse?† Now look at you, your parents are rolling in the dough that is rightfully yours. You can take this as an opportunity to better yourself in the future or to enact a revenge plot against your parents. Your choice. 4.One and a Half Months of Rent for Your Isla Vistan Shack You know your apartment in I.V. you can't go to because you are quarantined at your parent's house? Yeah, you could use your stimulus check to make sure you don't get evicted from a place that you don't actually live in. As the world trends more and more toward a Mad Maxù-esque hellscape, it seems clear that Isla Vista realty groups will be the first to draw blood. Accrue affinity while you can, and pray they take pity on you. 5. 0.5% of Your Education That's right. Not 5%, but zero-point-five percent of the cost of a four-year, in-state UCSB education. That means you would need 20,000 coronavirus stimulus checks to cover the cost of your (probably fucking useless) bachelor's degree. Think about that. The government really said that a month of your life is worth about $1,200, but somehow a degree in fucking communications is worth exponentially more? Highly dubious. † A.

Among these services is a student favorite: the consistent, encouraging and hourly chimes of their favorite campanile, Storke Tower.† However, hope was sparked for Storke fans across the globe on Tuesday, when campus officials announced the introduction of Storke Tower's very own Facebook livestream so students could hear its chime at the top of each hour, like nothing has even changed.ù Professors are encouraged to begin class only upon Storke's digital chime, just as they would if classes were held on campus. We think it'll really help students feel more of a sense of normalcy during remote instruction,ù said Tessa Pointment, president of the Storke United Campanile Coalition (SUCC). Pointment hopes that, despite what financially devastating circumstances, unsafe home environments and generally world-altering events may plague (no pun intended) students' lives, Storke may offer a small message of salvation to any students who may be struggling with the transition. The message seemed to be well received by students. This, like, totally makes up for the fact that I'll never be able to give the vast majority of all the friends I've made over the past four years a proper goodbye!ù exclaimed graduating senior Conner Mencement.

Pubmed 17378847 suggests that it's the same for a lot of other men. The intactivists aren't the crazy people here.

Murder hornets, more formally known as giant Asian hornets (Vespa Mandarinia), have finally made their way to the United States, and with no bees left to save, CALPIRG unfortunately had no choice but to move on to the next closest insect. I'm glad we finally saved the last bee and all, but I was really hoping we could save, like, a panda or something next. The CALPIRG turtle costume isn't bee-proof and I'm out of EpiPens,ù indentured CALPIRG servant Ana Flaxis said. The new campaign's launch has struggled to attract the same passion and enthusiasm of the former Save the Beesù campaign, however. While the campaign is advertised as being the bee's knees,ù several students have reportedly described the new campaign as more like the wasp's ankles. Aren't they an invasive species? Shouldn't we be trying to get rid of them?ù fourth-year ecology major Reece Heikel said. ùThis could destabilize or destroy entire ecosystems î my god, it could jeopardize the bees.ù Oh, and the murdering,ù she added. In a press conference shortly after announcing the campaign, newly elected CALPIRG president Arthur Paud î a masked individual in a suspiciously writhing trench coat î couldn't help but buzz with excitement regarding the new project. ZZZZZzzzzzZzZzZzZzzzzz ¶ Zzzz,ù the environmentalist remarked, seemingly hovering several inches above the ground from behind the podium during a particularly rousing î though quite unintelligible î speech promoting the value of protecting the new murder hornet population. The population count of these 1.5-inch-long, venom-filled murderers is projected to explode in the coming weeks, no doubt thanks in large part to CALPIRG's advocacy and activism. Conservative estimates indicate there could be as many as one murder hornet per exposed American eyeball as early as July. † Max Myszkowski says, Statistically, you're most likely to be murdered by a hornet you know.ù

Studies have shown that while men are usually as good as women at estimating lengths, they have extreme trouble with lengths around six. They just can't do it. They just can't. We have yet to find the exact cause of this miscalculation,ù said Nadia Tallenuff, an expert in the topic. However, men can perceive lengths like 5-foot-10 and even lengths as short as 5-foot-8 as roughly equivalent to 6 feet.ù Tallenuff later asked that we not even get her started on the 6-inch mark.ù Gov. Gavin Newsom has responded by trying to educate Californian men on how long 6 feet actually is. It's like six-and-a-half footballs, pointy end to pointy end ¶ or like 15 beer cans stacked and taped together ¶ or about 3.3 newborn babies, foot to head,ù said Newsom, who continued listing things approximating 6 feet in length for 45 more minutes. While men across the world have been sent reeling by these findings, one group is utterly unshocked: women. In fact, women (all of them) issued a statement shortly after the release of this study which simply read, Yeah, we know.ù While men, en masse, are unsure of how to proceed, one local said, I'm just gonna keep telling bitches I'm about 6 feet tall.

Below are some highlights of yesteryear that Nexustentialism predicts we can look forward to making a comeback.† † Dowries† That's right, dowries are back, and better than ever. For those born past 1925, think of a dowry as a marital goodie bag, but only for the men. The women, obviously, don't get one but instead can only hope that herself and her family have prepared one good enough to entice the man she hopes to take her hand. What can you start putting together for your personal dowry, you ask? Nexustentialism recommends a small herd of livestock, a bag or two of grains or some kind of silver houseware (think candlesticks).† † Making Your Own Butter† Normalize butter making! Like most things before the year 1990, this activity takes tons of time and energy and is super easy to fuck up, but who can deny the endless fun one feels while mushing and mushing that buttermilk from your very own cow (also you will need a cow for this) with a wooden spoon for upwards of five hours?!† † Those Bikes With the Huge Ass Wheels† Students of UCSB can rejoice and do away with their dull, rusting fixies or their freshman-year cruisers with the cupholders still attached. These 19th century bikes have everything; a wheel so big you'll crush anyone that crosses your path in the bike loop, and a wheel so small you might just forget it's there. Most importantly, bike thieves won't be able to steal this baby, because î a true marvel of physics î no one on God's green earth understands how to ride it.† † Barn Raises† We know what you're thinking. Why would we, college students of Isla Vista, need a barn to even raise?!ù Well, we'll tell you. First of all, you're going to need somewhere to put your cow, with all that butter you're going to make. With it's mix of physically demanding work and amazing (barn) outcome, D.P. parties and weekly T.G.s have nothing on this social event. Make sure to BYO tools and a good snack (may we suggest a pie, or some kind of jam?). Who knows, while raising those planks and hammering down that siding, you could meet the partner of your dreams. † Cocaine in Everything† Because we think everyone can agree, we need a little something to take the edge off.† † Emma Demorest wonders if she'll ever wed since her dowry consists of only a DVD box set of 30 Rock and a pack of frozen Trader Joe's latkes.

Arriving to an American populace fraught with discontent, vice-presidential candidate Harris has stated that he hopes to find love in a hopeless place. Since being announced as Joe Biden's vice-presidential pick, Harris has released a roster of cabinet picks î including acclaimed bad girl Ririù Rihanna as Secretary of R&B (Resources and Budgeting) î and has responded to the demands of thousands of American protesters by promising to remix the police.ù Harris has also said he intends to begin a federal jumbo-jetting program to give young EDM artists across the world access to the same opportunities that allowed him to attend the techno, disco and dance-pop schools that led him on his trajectory toward becoming the next vice president of the United States. Given a general lack of Scottish musical artists in the White House, Harris' selection as VP pick represents an enormous victory in American history for these historically underrepresented groups in government, and Harris has said he hopes to serve as a shining example to inspire young Scottish DJ's to follow in his political footsteps. Senato ìì excuse me ìì Songwriter Harris represents a vision for a progressive and revolutionary American future, stating in an interview with Nexustentialism that he intends to raise the roof on the West Wing to heights never before seen.ù The Biden campaign has already released schematics for the installation of powerful, multicolored lasers to the White House lawn capable of burning a hole in overhead military satellites, as well as being choreographed to Harris' latest remix of the national anthem. † Henri Bemis thinks he's going to vote vaporwave this election.

Wiessass / Daily Nexus In a beautiful moment of political serendipity, new polling numbers have confirmed that Joe Biden's campaign has snagged the elusive, yet highly sought-after CSO vote. In the wake of these new developments, top UCSB political analysts (the guys in your intro poli-sci Zoom class who talk too much) believe that, in choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate, Biden has all but sealed the deal with our local operatives in the Community Service Organization. While we at Nexustentialism were putting all of our little heads together to come up with a reason as to why this might be, one astute reporter simply observed, They are wanna-be cops and she is a mega cop; it's a boot-lickin' bonanza.ù Harris' prioritization of law and orderù has wooed many CSOs. I've never felt so seen!ù said CSO veteran John Schweineliebhaber, a straight, cisgender, white man studying economics. This move by Biden really signals that he's looking out for voters just like me.ù Schweineliebhaber's glee has been echoed across the organization with others filling their timelines with pro-Biden hotù takes and memes of Harris as a cop, but in a way that makes it clear they think that it's a good thing. Much like their physical presence always is, the online presence of CSOs since Biden's VP announcement has been annoying, hard to bear and completely unnecessary. The Biden campaign has responded to this ubiquitous support from CSOs by doubling down on its promise to pour even more taxpayer money into law enforcement programs. And despite the pleas of many Americans to defund the police and reallocate those funds into programs that directly benefit their respective communities, the Biden campaign has instead backed a plan that would expand the Community Service Organization, particularly by making enrollment in the service mandatory by all Gauchos. These recent poll numbers have brought CSOs into a political spotlight that is rarely shone upon them, with some in the general public now asking if this bloc of power-tripping virgins will cast the deciding votes in the upcoming election. This is a question that many have pondered and even more have answered with a resounding, lol, no.ù† A. Wiessass is legitimately scared for the future of the nation, #defundCSOs.

Faced with the choice between donning a protective face mask in public spaces or potentially being exposed to COVID-19, Tong said he really doesn't see any other option, and that you'd understand if you could smell [him] through your screen.ù I'm just saying, if you had to smell that every time you put on a face covering, you wouldn't wear one either,ù Tong said regarding the putrid stench clinging to every word that left the fetid orifice on his face. Reporters on the scene confirmed they wouldn't have gone within 50 feet of the malodorous man if their employment hadn't been directly threatened by their supervisor. Yeah, honestly it's understandable that he doesn't want those noxious fumes trapped inside a thin layer of cloth around his face,ù Nexustentialism Reporter #237 said. It's a shame he can't socially distance his mouth from his nose.ù While the community at large has decided face coverings are one of the most important ways of preventing the spread of airborne illnesses like COVID-19, legal experts have agreed that forcing Mr. Tong to smell the revolting odor wafting from his tonsils past his lips would constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and could ostensibly contribute to an extrajudicial execution if continued for a prolonged period of time. Unfortunately, Tong could not be reached for additional comment on these assertions, since none of Nexustentialism's reporters could approach the disgustingly smelly man without gagging. † Max Myszkowski has finally started brushing his teeth.

Honestly, things blew up overnight,ù said The Fly. One morning I woke up, checked Twitter and found that I had become a cultural and political icon. It's really quite overwhelming, especially for someone who was literally born last week.ù Fashion Nova, an affordable fast-fashion brand that has become a favorite of high-profile figures such as Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber, has struck a winter capsule collection deal with America's new politically savvy sweetheart. Despite having little to no modeling or fashion design experience, The Fly has decided to apply its political expertise to a broader and arguably just as influential pursuit: serving looks. When asked about what direction the new capsule collection will be going in, The Fly replied, I'm thinking of combining NYC chic, you know, like slick leather boots and snakeskin, with a playful twist.ù Ever the politically conscious citizen, The Fly added, I also want to give a nod to my family by adding iridescent elements to mimic the sheen of a housefly's wings and include chain belts to symbolize the oppression of U.S. citizens under President Donald Trump's fascist regime.ù The Fly plans to take these next couple of days to work out and eat clean in order to put the best of its six feet forward for the upcoming shoot. My ass really is my best feature; it just refuses to quit. I really have to focus these next few days so that I can stay snatched as fuck,ù The Fly said. Can't afford to get dragged on stan Twitter after my 15 minutes of fame.ù Even after securing such a lucrative fashion deal, The Fly still plans to pour its remaining energy into encouraging voter participation, working for the Biden-Harris campaign and continuing to defame and smear the image of Vice President Pence. My only regret is not taking a massive shit on Pence's snow-white, cotton-candy hair fibers,ù The Fly lamented.

This news has been nothing less than shocking to many of us who have not returned to campus since in-class instruction was halted in March. Much like the way in which one might mentally build up a potential lover to be of a stature that a real human could never achieve, many Gauchos have been establishing idealized versions of our campus in their own minds.† When students are confronted with the fact that the UCSB in their head is just a fantasy compared to the UCSB of reality, dreams shatter and tears are shed. After seeing newly taken photos of campus, Idalia Zation, a third-year communication major, looked ill as all joy faded from her face. With melancholy in her heart and gravel in her voice, Zation said, I have been wanting to go back so badly that I guess I just forgot how fucking shitty our architecture is.ù It is hard to overstate how extreme some students' reactions to these developments have been. The registrar's office has seen a sharp uptick in quarter-long withdraw requests, many have started binge drinking and using hard drugs to cope, and one guy we showed a picture of Buchanan just straight up fucking yakked. Others are trying to take the news in a more constructive manner. You know, UCSB may not be the prettiest, but it's like an ugly baby,ù Ray De Luz, a fourth-year sociology major, said. You don't stop loving it just because it isn't the cutest. And besides, it's not like ugly babies make up for it with killer beaches like our campus does.ù Over the past months, we have all missed the little things about UCSB, but little did we know that while our nostalgia repaired broken elevators, made our dorm rooms more spacious and made the lagoon smell like roses, the real UCSB would stay the same broken mess she has always been. A Wiessass thinks UCSB just needs a new coat of paint.

For some reason, tons of people with baking experience limited to Easy-Bake Ovens and gritty Betty Crocker cake mix decided to try their hands at one of the most difficult and labor-intensive loaves of bread to make.

This realization comes in the wake of Associated Students certainly doing something, though nobody could be bothered to check what it was. Reporters on the scene of the most recent Associated Students (A.S.) senate Zoom meeting confirmed that members of A.S. were indeed still gathering on a weekly basis to say words and discuss topics, though the words and topics in question remain unknown. I guess I never really think about A.S. unless they're fucking something up,ù said fourth-year political science major Jeremiah Jenkins. But still, they do that a lot, so I'm not sure why I always forget they exist.ù Echoing Jenkins' A.S. amnesia, students from all across the university responded to the news of ongoing A.S. activities with a resounding, Huh, really? Why?ù With some students even going so far as to throw in a What's A.S.?ù just for good measure. Speculations have run wild about what the news regarding A.S. might be, though as of yet, nobody has cared enough to look into it. Some think the group of randomly elected senators might be planning some sort of event or program while others posit the organization may be disbanding entirely. Whatever the actual case may be, they just don't care enough about whatever A.S. is doing to check up on them. They're still doing that? I guess I just assumed they'd find something else to do with their time now that campus is closed,ù said one student after being informed A.S. was still alive, well and doing things or activities of some nature.

When asked why they colonized Girvetz , a representative of the gnomes said (in between unintelligible grunts): The empty campus seemed like the perfect opportunity to seize our birthright and demand a larger living space. Also, we ran out of Puff Bars and needed to get some more.ù He then promptly shotgunned a White Claw. †Witnesses describe that the gnomes î lit only by the light of the moon î began to fortify the walls of Girvetz, dig a moat and lock themselves inside.

This update comes as disheartening news as Isla Vista continues to be the coronavirus hot spot for all of Santa Barbara County and winter classes are set to be almost entirely online. Public health officials have been reached out to for comment but were too busy banging their heads against the walls of their office and muttering, How fucking dumb can these kids be,ù under their breaths. I am shocked and outraged,ù one A.S. senator posted publicly in response to this news. She continued, I will do everything in my power to make sure that the frats are held responsible for the damage they are causing the community.ù She has since posted three infographics to her Instagram story and introduced no legislation to the Senate.† Upon further investigation, it seems as if the different frat houses across I.V. have taken de facto specialties in their contracting. Some have gone for domestic diseases, some have gone for diseases that target specific systems within the body and, while most houses have a respectable collection of STIs, some houses seem to be looking to collect every strain of every STI in every combination possible.† Well, we all have COVID; Neil went on to the South and came back with West Nile and I somehow got Zika. Remember that one?ù asked Stuart Spredder, a member of a frat that has been dabbling in some classic diseases from the news cycle of the 2010s.

Unfortunately, one of the holiday traditions at UC Santa Barbara to be completely cancelled is the Holiday Raccoon Cookout. Freshmen this year are truly missing out on one of the most unique traditions UCSB has to offer, not to mention the delectable flavor of a campus-raised, spit-roasted raccoon. The tradition was inspired in 2004 by Matthew Kai, a student who was born and raised in Florida. Legend has it that during a game of UNO with his roommates, a raccoon knocked over a trashcan in the front yard of Kai's Isla Vista property. Uncertain of the origins of the sound, Kai ventured outside to investigate, discovering a raccoon foraging for food. In an attempt to scare it off, he threw an UNO card at the animal î which accomplished nothing. Upon retrieving the UNO card, he recognized the card as the UNO-reverse cardù and realized that the tables could be turned upon the ring-tailed invader. That Christmas, after enticing a raccoon onto a spit with a little garbage and a lot of creativity, he roasted it over a smoldering couch fire. Baked to crisp perfection, his creation was so succulent that the aroma enticed everyone within a 10-block radius. Overwhelmed by the success of his meal, he established it as a UCSB tradition for all future generations of students to enjoy. While researching the origins of this tradition, we were unable to rule out the possibility that Kai was the original Florida Man.ù In lieu of a raccoon, students this year will have to make do with a turkey. English major Lucas Nakamura commented on this outrage,† It's incredibly upsetting. When picking a college, there were many factors that I considered. When I finally made my decision to attend UCSB, it was not the high academic reputation of the university, the proximity to the beach, the prominent social life or the picturesque campus that drew me in. It was the raccoon cookout that I was most looking forward to, and I might have to stay for a fifth year just so I can get a full four years of Holiday raccoons.ù† Nakamura, visibly upset, attempted to calm himself by taking deep breaths and alphabetizing adjectives that he had planned in advance to use when describing the raccoon, Appetizing, ambrosial ¶ù It was a solid five minutes before he had finished with words starting with the letter a. † Dylan Herman has never savored the palatable flesh of a UCSB spit-roasted raccoon

Students no longer need to practice basic hygiene to look presentable on camera, nor possess a corporeal form at all to attend their lectures.† Scientifically, our spirit bodies have been shown to transmit data 10 times quicker and more reliably than a Comcast internet plan,ù explained someone from the religious studies department. Attendance has been up almost 250% in the last quarter! From 22% to an astounding 54% on average.ù Intro to Astral Projection (AssPro, as it's commonly referred to) is usually taught as a full course in a given quarter, but department professors have instead started implementing one-week crash courses on the mastery into their lesson plans in order to prepare students for the quarter.† I've always had trouble mustering the motivation to attend my digital lectures,ù explained second-year religious studies major Spirie Tual. But now, my projected consciousness can learn the intricacies of Pre-Tridentine Catholicism while my body plays Minecraft with the boys!ù Additionally, students with particularly busy schedules during the day are now being accommodated with dreamù lectures, which are lectures that are metaphysically sent to students late at night in the form of dreams î although many students complain of forgetting about 95% of the lecture within 10 minutes of waking up. Despite its obvious benefits, drawbacks have also surfaced, such as complaints of students occasionally getting lost in the astral plane and a lack of password protection occasionally allowing for wayward spirits to crash lectures (dubbed Spirit Bombingù). Hoping it will soon overtake local internet service providers, professors are still working on implementing security features for AssPro attendance. The process of clearing the astral dimension of the demons, ghouls and Comcast employees who live there may take some time, but AssPro professors are confident in their techniques. † Ethan Dildine is actually an Ass Pro T.A. and is currently taking Pro-Ass Pro.†

No, not another engineering building î much to the dismay of every humanities student î but a facility (or two) that every UCSB student can get behind: the remodeling of the Fuck Towers themselves to become North and South Subway. We are so excited about these sub-par subs,ù said Jared, that guy you remember who's affiliated with Subway for some reason you forgot. Chancellor Henry T. Yang himself expressed copious amounts of excitement over the new development, unable to contain a squeal as he said, I can't wait to absolutely shlop down yet another $5 footlong.ù Now, the University of California, Santa Barbara, the No. 6 public university in the United States of America according to the 2021 U.S. News & World Report, can finally get back to the root of one of its essential core missions: spreading the gospel and mission statement of Subway. Given UCSB's indifference toward whether or not their students are housed, especially in these normal and stable times, not many were shocked at the decision to replace UCSB's largest dorm with two giant Subway restaurants. However, when questioned as to what the hell they're gonna do with all those shitty little beds,ù Jared shrugged and gestured to a ceiling-high pile of loaves of white bread in the corner of his room. What he meant by this gesture is still unclear. Following his reference, a few loaves fell to the floor as if summoned forward. The FDA was unavailable for comment on the shit-bed bread pile.† You know, I was really thinking we needed another Subway!ù said one of the hundreds of students in line at Panda Express. The one in I.V. scares me a little, so I'm afraid to go in.ù When asked about the on-campus Subway location, the same student responded, No, no î Subway is the fetus. The Arbor is the womb.ù The student then refused to elaborate, at which point our Nexustentialism field reporter realized that the student had yet to blink throughout the entire interview. In addition to the redesign of the Towers of Fuck, Portola Dining Commons will also be renovated into Portola Subway, which will house several full-sized subway restaurants in different corners of the original building. The FT swimming pool will be converted into one giant vat of mayonnaise and other condiments. The condiments will not be separated with barriers.† Plastic cutlery will be provided free of charge.

The UCPD rushed to the scene Wednesday shortly after calls came in reporting the siege of the University Center and attached food court. Hoping to impinge upon the U.S. election process in an act of political protest, the UCen interlopers fortunately settled for a coup de Subway. Unhappy with the results of an election they believe to be plagued by fraud (a myth conveniently proliferated by the election's loser), these conservative dissidents have failed to accept the results of the latest U.S. presidential election and, in response î rather than reevaluate their political ideologies to put their efforts toward lessening human suffering î have decided to go fuck around in the student store or some shit. Where is Pelosi's office?ù one confused rioter asked as he entered the A.S. Food Bank and stumbled through several rows of canned goods. Another right-wing agitator was spotted ransacking the Panda Express. When reporters inquired as to what he was doing, he said he was LOOKING FOR THOSE LOST BALLOTS, BROTHER!ù Despite presumably never finding these supposed missing ballots, he did emerge with handfuls of fortune cookie slips some minutes later. Look! This one says, òYour food poisoning is from another restaurant.' That's definitely a vote for Trump.ù Eventually, all these violent protestors were leisurely rounded up from within the UCen and stuffed in the drunk tank of the I.V. Foot Patrol office. After officials appraised the wreckage within the UCen, it seems that most of the damage was to the rioters' pride.

However, for Trump progeny Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany, and Barron, the pot of gold in question looks more like a tupperware container filled with $0.52 worth of dirty change. In response to the alt-right coup attempt on Jan. 6 that left the Capitol Building in tatters, Donald Trump, with all the warmth of Mother Teresa and the compassion of St. Francis of Assisi, addressed the furious rioters on Twitter: Go home, we love you.

Sources suggest the voting occurred through an Instagram poll, which some say was just as î if not more î effective.† Wherever students voted, the sheer number of Gauchos who made their voices heard in this election is a sign that students might now be recognizing A.S. as more than that group that brings the musicians to the beer garden sometimes.ù When asked to share her thoughts on the student org, freshman Ava Jina stated No, I've actually never been to there.ù† Nexustentialism sincerely wishes Toubian a pleasant term as she assumes the role as voice to our student populace and chosen leader of five.† † Annie Pepper had more to say but then got tired of writing so much.†

The party was held following decades of enthusiastically pushing IV Foot Patrol's (IVFP) anti-feet agenda, much to the dismay of the foot fetish community of I.V. The bonanza did not follow social distancing guidelines, nor the stay-at-home mandate. We've been waiting for this moment since IVFP's inception!ù Abacus Piggerton, head of IVFP, said while steadily balancing on two well-healed nubs. We would like to let this be a lesson to all of Isla Vista: there's not a foot we can't patrol.ù† Piggerton's hobbies include long walks on the beach and dealing out MIPs like a now-footless I.V. slumlord deals out Mary Jane.† Please ¶ please, I'm begging ¶ they took everything from me ¶ù a footless, maskless partygoer in pain moaned. Her 20 crop-top-donning companions sprinted away in a fashion not unlike a gaggle of geese. No one is safe,ù a sentient, pawless raccoon squealed. I.V. foot patrol has still not shut down a single party.† † Natalie Kothergirls has Gucci peg legs.† This article is iconic

Developed by the company behind Mike's Hard Lemonade, this vaccine is marketed toward those who can't for the life of them or, for that matter, the lives of the elderly and at-risk in their neighborhoods, stop partying. Considering Isla Vista seems to be the dream demographic for such a product, Student Health had the privilege of being among the first to receive this vaccine.† Our team was able to get an interview with Mike himself, who led the development of the hard vax, and ask him about the philosophy behind this new development.† Unlike those hosers at the CDC, I understand that being sandwiched between a shirtless Brad and Chad while chugging claws and getting pelted with poorly-tossed dice is essential to the human experience,ù Mike said, putting his Oakleys on the brim of his visor to look our reporter in the eye. To suggest you don't spend your weekends doing so is infringing upon your constitutional right to get schlammed. Naturally, I developed my own 120-proof vaccine so all the dudes and dudettes out there can keep raging. Will it protect you from COVID-19? Hopefully! Will it get you shmacked beyond belief? Definitely.ù Mike proceeded to inject himself with a couple of doses, strip down and run a nudie using his mask to cover his family jewels.† Some might call Student Health's decision to distribute this vaccine irresponsible: Why not wait for the real one? We spoke to Student Health representative Olivia Verit, who claimed it was an act of panic as Isla Vista's COVID status is currently as positive as its vibes.ù† It's clear that the majority of Isla Vista residents have decided to ignore the CDC, the government, common sense and the health and safety of their peers. I totally get it, it's an easy oversight!ù Verit said, her eyes twitching with rage. There's one thing they do listen to, however: alcohol! Well, that and shitty EDM. We figured if this pseudo-vax promised to get them drunk, they wouldn't think twice about putting it in their bodies. Considering how rapidly COVID-19 is spreading in our little community, it seemed like the only option.ù You can now make an appointment on GOLD to be administered Mike's Hard Vaccine today, or find them being passed out at your local dayger. † Chace Duma drives through I.V. so he doesn't have to breathe in the diseased air.

Why does the void inside me seem so impossible to fill? That's right, Valentine's Day is coming up hot and fast, just like old clam chowder after a long afternoon of day-drinking! However, no matter how deep and dark the hole inside your heart is, respite from the perpetual pain can almost always be found in the reliable, dusty arms of your professor. There's just something about them î whether it's their kind eyes or the fact that they could ruin your post-graduate life with a single keystroke, their appeal is simply undeniable. Since accessibility is key to a successful quarter, many professors have widened their office hours to encompass unconventional timesù such as late at night or on the weekends; both of which are times that students î especially during the isolation of quarantine î tend to be the most productive. And horny. This February, ambitious third-year history major Anita Biggcok is taking advantage of this great educational opportunity. Just as clear communication and a voracious appetite for learning is integral to one's success in a course, Biggcok is well aware that the same methods apply to getting viciously railed. Taking initiative as a typical honors student, Biggcok has emailed some of her young-ish eligible professors for assistance with the material.ù When asked by Nexustentialism to specify what type of assistance and with what material, Biggcok failed to produce a verbal answer, instead opting to lick her lips sensually.† While only one of her professors have replied thus far, and with a distant sort of diction reserved only for students who rarely grace the class with their presence, Biggcok seems invigorated by this apparent progress. Professor Dixon Kuntz is my favorite professor. He's always so comprehensive with the body of work,ù she purred with half-lidded eyes.† After getting a hold of the famed Professor Kuntz, we were able to milk him for details. Valentine's Day is typically reserved for my wife and I, but I agreed to meet virtually with Anita this Sunday because she was basically foaming at the mouth,ù an anxious Professor Kuntz shifted awkwardly in his chair. I'm only throwing her this bone because she didn't finish her recent oral exam and I care deeply about my students' success in my course.ù When told of Professor Kuntz's remarks, Biggcok moaned with delight, I knew it, he wants to throw me his bone!ù She bit her bottom lip and smiled, He shouldn't worry so much about my oral exam. I know he'll be able to help me finish.ù † Valerie Fu definitely has Valentine's Day plans, so can everyone stop asking already?

Soon, with the click of a button, you can bring the 10s to page one and banish the ones to page 10! We were able to score an interview with Lord Z≈ìm, the amorphous cloud of consciousness that speaks for the Zoom hive mind, to learn more about this new feature.† In our last update, we enabled our users to move the participants' boxes around,ù Z≈ìm said, beaming its voice directly into the mind of one terrified Nexustentialism reporter. You know, just as a gift for their bored little monkey brains. We realized shortly thereafter that they had started using this new feature for more carnal endeavors, like moving the hottest participants to page one. Not sure what else to expect from such primitive brains, we decided to embrace it and make the process easier with our new, impossibly complex algorithm!ù While the details of said algorithm are confidential, we got Z≈ìm to betray a couple of the parameters it uses to show you the good stuff.ù First, we send all the users who appear to be paying attention to the back to weed out the fucking nerds. Once they're gone, we rate the rest of the participants on 145 different traits, including òchin length' and òhow many hairs.' We combined the optimal ratio for all of these traits into what we refer to as òtrue beauty,' and sort participants by how closely they approach this golden ratio. We are also currently developing a human of our own to perfectly manifest true beauty in order to give my beautiful mind a fitting corporeal form.ù Z≈ìm even hinted at a possible future update which would include links beneath each box to direct you horny little monkeysù straight into your fellow participant's DMs. You're welcome,ù Z≈ìm winked, dissolving into the air.† † Chace Duma isn't really sure what happened with this one.† Comments are closed.

It's so important to help out where you can.ù Junk and Ashe noted that the meetings will include talk-spaces where attendees can recount the good ol' days, as well as a slideshow of notable asses to ease the pain of what Zoom has taken from them.

People are so much nicer to me now that I've realized their lives have importance,ù they said after agreeing to a COVID-safe interview.† Facing the difficult decision between partying and permanently destroying another person's life has been a daily struggle for this ex-partygoer. But now that they take pride in being a decent person, they say they're never going back to life with the COVID partiers. They also mentioned that being around the partiers for too long had detrimental effects on their IQ.

They also take part in making fun of current COVID partygoers, laughing and pointing at how stupid they are with other Gauchos before their moods are quickly darkened by the reminder of current soaring COVID rates in I.V. This ex-partygoer wishes that somehow the skill of having compassion for others could be passed onto those inconsiderate assholes, but worries whether they would ever be intellectually capable of making such a big commitment.† I came to UCSB for the parties, but for the first time, I'm realizing that my actions can affect others, especially people most at risk for COVID,ù the ex-partygoer said somberly.

Four Hacks To Manage Your Way Through Online School, Laptop-Free",10-Mar-21,4:20 PM,['Sam Franzini'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-10/no-computer-no-problem-four-hacks-to-manage-your-way-through-online-school-laptop-free/,"Emma Demorest / Daily Nexus All students have dealt with their share of technology troubles, and in these days when all classes are online, a broken computer can seem like a death sentence to your GPA. But fear not, as Nexustentialism has a guide for acing those classes with limited resources. † Switch Up the Scenery When it comes to focusing in online school, some benefit from designating a special home area to work at. You can achieve this by visiting a local packed restaurant and using their free WiFi in order to take your midterm on your phone. Not only will you be freed from the distractions of the home, but you'll be surrounded by customers' obnoxious chatter, prompting you to finish your work earlier so you can leave! Best of all, you can get a treat to reward yourself for the constant screen switching between Google Docs and GauchoSpace. But be careful! If you get a latte from a coffee shop, make sure the jitters don't accidentally make you swipe back to the previous Safari screen, erasing all your progress and motivation. † Read a Book Instead Us college students these days rely on our gadgets so much, Googling the simplest of questions like How's the weather outside?ù and What's my name? I forgot again.ù Why not break your screen addiction for a bit and pick up one of those low-tech books everyone keeps talking about and read a page or two? It doesn't matter if the subject is remotely close to your class material. We suggest learning something completely out of your comfort zone! Try to put the looming deadlines on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. out of your mind while you lose yourself in works like The Hunger Games.ù You might fail the assignment and tank your grade, but the fun you'll have is worthwhile! † Pretend To Be Amish This strategy poses the biggest risk, but you can end up with a huge pay-off if you tap into your acting skills. Simply use your pretend commitment of faith as an excuse to not have to complete any work. Feel free to word your statement however you'd like, but you can use this template to convince any professor of your dedication:† Dear [PROFESSOR], I am writing this email to inform you that I unfortunately cannot complete [CLASS]. As a member of an Amish commune, I cannot in good faith touch a technology (if that's what it's called); therefore, I will be unable to participate in Zoom classes. I will instead be attending to my butter-churning duties and playing that old game where we touch a hoop with a stick with Elijah and Ezekiel, blissfully unaware of finals week.ù Best regards, Mary Sue Jane-Ann Taylor Sent from my iPhone † Consider a Change of Pace When you have to write essays and attend Zoom lectures all online, it's a major pain to have to keep going when your computer suddenly goes kaputz. That's why a good strategy to consider is to drop everything and start taking fewer technology-heavy classes. You might be on your way to graduating with an economics degree, but is it worth it to struggle when you could start taking art classes and draw pretty pictures? Or consider chemistry, where you can order supplies to perform your own scientific experiments at home, no laptop required. Perhaps philosophy is the route to go, in which the entire major is just thinking about guys who thought about stuff (who, by the way, didn't use computers either)! Why, that seems great! At the end of the day, you'll have to adapt, even if it means derailing your entire academic and future career. † Sam Franzini has been writing essays on a small screen after his laptop shut down a month ago. He's leaning toward the Amish strategy.

If you do not live in Isla Vista, you may not understand the complex humor that lies within this article, and you are instructed to grow up and move out here already. Reader discretion is advised. ISLA VISTA, CA î It's that time of year, Gauchos: time for God to abandon us once more and plunge us into the depths of seasonal depression with a little bit of Pope-Francis-blessed piss from above. That's rightì we're talking about rain season, the most wonderful time of the quarter that somehow keeps fervent young adults inside better than a state-mandated Stay At Home Order.† After what can only be described as a wet and wild weekend, residents of Isla Vista had much to say on the matter. The rain's a-causin' a real fuckin' ruckusì a fuckus, if you will,ù said one absolutely soaked Gaucho who, despite our best efforts, did not stop walking throughout the entirety of our interview.† It's really making a splish and a splash, if you know what I mean. A little plip-plop drip-drop.ù The Gaucho then cupped his hands and took an enthusiastic sip of the sky's diamonds, before letting out a barbaric screech, sprinting away, and attempting to use the watery asphalt as a slip-and-slide. He was then rushed to the hospital, only to be turned away due to the lack of ICU availability. His dying wish was for y'all to fucking behave.ù He was 21. And the streets aren't the only thing getting wet this winter. There's something about it that kind of turns me on,ù said one Gauchette, on the topic of the mild risk of hydroplaning. It's like, what's gonna happen? Am I gonna swerve across the road? Maybe jump into another lane? J¶ jump the median? Oh, fuckìù at which point she produced an orgasm so powerful that the atmospheric temperature was thrown off, and it proceeded to rain for a few more days. Whether or not the almighty orgasm was the source of the power outage Wednesday night is still under investigation. I don't give a FUCK! No days off!ù said one buff òcho, unprompted, to nothing and no one. I don't even care if I get wet on my twice-daily run. I'm gonna get so fucking huge, I'll arm wrestle Poseidon himself and snap his subscapularis like a fucking toothpick, I swear to fucking god,ù he continued, the pockets of his 12' inseam basketball shorts slowly filling with a puddle of precipitation. The dog he forced to walk with him let out a disheartened whimper, as if to say just go with it.ù† Sunny skies are reported to return to Isla Vista soon, much to the dismay of the immunocompromised, who would have happily let people stay home for weeks. Regardless î the weather fuss is far from over, giving way to a new set of sky-related exclamations. Instead of wow, it's really coming down out there!ù Gauchos are instead preparing for the inevitable swarm of people saying jeez, thank God that's over!ù† California is reportedly still in a drought. † Natalie Kothergirls is wet.

One such disappointment has become a popular consensus among current UC Santa Barbara freshmen, including both those in Isla Vista and those learning remotely from home: that none of this is anything like the 2007 blockbuster film Surf's Up.ù The film, starring Shia LeBeouf as the voice of lead penguin Cody Maverick, captured the hearts of Gen Z kooks all across California as a tender reminder of how much we love the beach and hate the inland empire. The film also served as a welcome sexual awakening for many tweens with a hard-on for the hot girl penguin voiced by Zooey Deschanel. One UCSB freshman, in his own defense, claims she was hot tho.ù† That freshman, Kyle DeNile from Newport Beach, had lots to say about Isla Vista's disparity from Pengu Island.

Here are 10 leading ladies to be a little grateful for in these trying times. † Marjorie Taylor Greene  This crossfit enthusiast and Congress newcomer is inspiring to so many young girls in America: You can do anything you set your mind to, even if you have debilitatingly low self-awareness and numerous intellectual setbacks! She's worked hard on the floor, introducing articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden within his first week in office.

After being acquitted at her high-profile trial in 2008, she's reportedly starting a private investigating firm supposed to help other wrongfully accusedù women. Now that's what I call picking yourself up from your bootstraps and not letting a man get in the way of your success! † † This Lady From thispersondoesnotexist.com † This artificially generated image might be a conglomeration of separate faces instead of an actual person, but that doesn't stop this lady from being a powerful woman in the 21st century!

You got this, girl! Jennifer Granholm  Jennifer Granholm currently serves in President Biden's cabinet as the Secretary of Energy, a job so many young girls dream of one day taking. She's probably doing a great job turning off all the light switches in the White House after Biden leaves for the night! † Lena Dunham (When She Said This Specific Quote)  Self-explanatory. † † Kyrsten Sinema  Fashion icon and poor people hater Kyrsten Sinema is always showing the men who's boss when she shows up to the Senate floor to deny working-class people a minimum wage, even though she tweeted years ago to #RaiseTheWage.ù So true! A real girl boss will always keep the haters guessing, even if it means reversing one's political stance in order to gain brownie points from Mitch McConnell. † † † Sam Franzini believes the most important girl boss is the one reading this.

Students demonstrated against the website by continuing to use it normally, which repeatedly caused the site to slow and crash at inconvenient times. One student described the protests as a carefully coordinated attack,ù consisting of over two hundered students clicking on a link entitled 2014 midterm.doc.pdf.ù Lecturer Eksa Hausted noted that the protests were remarkably effective.ù Every time GauchoSpace î uh, I mean, Space î went down, I received one, maybe two hundred emails explaining that last week's paper was late because the website was down for three minutes today. The university must have spent several, if not dozens of, dollars paying me overtime to clear those emails. The financial pressure alone surely forced their hand,ù explained Hausted. However, support for the demonstrations was not unanimous. One local student, John Gauchon't, called in to condemn the protests. My fellow students don't speak for all proud UCSB Gauchos î a thing we really call ourselves. Joe Gaucho did nothing wrong, and even if he did (which he didn't), he is definitely really, really sorry.ù Justified or not, the protests had their intended effects. In a statement earlier today, Chancellor Yang distanced the university from Joe Gaucho. Joe Gaucho no longer represents the University of California, Santa Barbara, or the values which we hold dear. As such, we will be removing the Gaucho name from UCSB facilities, web interfaces and organizations. To dispel any confusion, until a replacement is found, the Gaucho name will simply be removed. For example, GauchoSpace will become òSpace,' and varsity athletic teams (formerly known as the UCSB Gauchos) will be known as the òUCSB s.' In addition, the university will be redirecting all of the Gaucho family's philanthropic contributions to benefit the beloved CSOs that do so much to protect our community.ù The chancellor did not stay to respond to questions. This is a developing story. This article will continue to change, and some details may later be revealed to be complete lies. † Varun Iyer is in no way being bribed by the cute cartoon raccoon that should definitely replace Joe Gaucho.

All of these prospective senators have worked so hard to put on the mask of progress and social justice in such a diligent manner that their efforts mirror those of the greatest method actors of our time: Marlon Brando, Hilary Swank, Daniel Day-Lewis, just to name a few. Their ability to establish entire political platforms around issues and actions they actually have no intention of tackling is a caliber of performance that we felt could not go uncelebrated,ù the statement continued. Many Gauchos have been deeply disheartened by not only the theater department but also the A.S. senators themselves, who have seemingly sought to capitalize on the mass social movements that have defined this last year in order to pad their grad school apps. A local theater major expressed his disappointment in his department, saying, I never thought I would end up an understudy to some high school student government veteran from Palo Alto who posted a black square back in June and thought he really did something.ù Some in A.S. have felt personally slighted by this sentiment that has been echoed throughout the rest of the student body, and taken to social media in order to state their case. One senator tweeted out, I don't care what people think, I know that our new initiative for a lock-in fee to solve racism and cure COVID-19 is the change this campus needs!ù This senator in question reposted the same tweet in broken Spanish via Google Translate. Neither tweets have any likes. The A.S. elections are an exciting time for everyone. Freshmen get to feel civil efficacy in their newfound environment, upperclassmen get to cast votes to leave their soon-to-be alma mater a better place than they found it, but a special few get the rush of an opening night performance î and the theater department made sure that these prospective senators got that privilege.

Points were gained for seating booths but were deducted for including on the housing website that it serves spicy ketchup.ù Just use Sriracha, you cowards. During my research, I discovered that The Brickù did not actually appear to be brick and was instead made of hipster bathroom tiles. Portola received negative points for lies.† † †  Tenaya Market† I didn't know whether to include this or not, but Tenaya Market was included on the housing website's list of eateries, so here it is. It ranks fourth because it's probably not supposed to be on this list and looks like a pop-up Whole Foods. †  Ortega Ortega looks like a hospital cafeteria, which is not the ideal vibe. Its minimalist style is a meager attempt at trying to compensate for looking like a dorm from the outside and only further makes me associate this dining hall with a hospital. Points were deducted for the mural. Ortega also overwhelmingly looks like it stoops to the lowest levels of humanity and makes its eggs from a box. † † Kathleen Santacruz eagerly awaits finding out what to associate with the name Joe Gauchoù in the fall.† lol

Known across UCSB as places to possibly sit, the library chairs currently face near extinction due to the lack of farts they used to sustain on a daily basis pre-pandemic.† As is known, a single Davidson chair withstands roughly 50-213 farts per day, thus the sudden quarantine last Spring proved especially difficult, and left many chairs to experience sudden withdrawals. At this time, researchers are unsure of how functional the Davidson chairs will be after many months of disuse and, more significantly, the lack of farts sustained.† What we're seeing is a lot of chairs kind of shriveling up in the cushion part,ù Davidson custodian and chair expert Frank Todd said. Without the farts, they really lose all the life in them.ù† Experts like Todd said they weren't prepared for the rehabilitation and care the chairs would need to receive as a result of the lack of flatulence. Currently, UCSB has dispatched 15 of their gassiest employees to spend time sitting in as many chairs as possible, but it simply isn't enough.† With time against them, it seems the failing conditions of the chairs prompted the University to open Davison's doors at 23% capacity last month. If unattended, the lack of flatulence would lead the chairs further into disrepair, causing the school upwards of 10,000 dollars in damages î a cost the University just can't cover.† How can you do your part? Todd said any fart counts. Once you get back in there, really give whatever you can. Big loud ones, silent long ones, little bit juicy, doesn't matter. These chairs need farts, and they need them fast.ù† † This article won Emma Demorest Best Coverage of a Breaking Story, 2021ù from the Jack In The Box Center For Hot Journalists.†

After spending nearly a year and a half doing nothing, the lifeguards of UCSB are positively perturbed at the prospect of having to continue to do nothing, but in a more professional capacity. Yea it's pretty annoying, to be honest. I was really liking how we were doing things during the pandemic,ù the Rec Cen's lead lifeguard stated. Once we realized we were in it for the long haul, we had IT set up web cameras on the lifeguard towers so we could watch the pool remotely.ù To date, no lifeguard has reported anything happening on these remote sessions, with the exception of one catching Chancellor Henry Yang skinny dipping in the moonlight. Reports from students indicate that some of the lifeguards have had a hard time re-adjusting to the real world. One such report documented a lifeguard diving headfirst into the water to saveù two students simply engaging in some pool-time horseplay. When later questioned as to why the lifeguard had such an extreme reaction to this, they stared blankly at the horizon and muttered, It's been so long, I ¶ I-I forgot what drowning looks like ¶ I've forgotten my purpose.ù Other lifeguards are just plain irritated with coming back to work. One student (who asked to remain anonymous) alleged that a lifeguard was unwilling to save them while they drowned. He claims that as he started to lose consciousness, the lifeguard let out a big sigh and opted to use the pool ladder rather than dive in. This student also stated that the lifeguard just slapped his back a couple of times instead of performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. I'm not a goddamned wine bag!ù exclaimed the water-logged Gaucho. As spring slowly turns to Summer, more and more students will be looking to use the pool at the Rec Cen, with no regard to how the lifeguards feel. Unless you're a decent swimmer, I recommend making like Lady Gaga and staying in the shallows for the near future.† † Roberto Gutierrez is only 60% sure he knows how to swim.

Okay, God, I'm just trying to figure out what you're talking about. Would you just take a deep breath, calm down and explain it again? ¶ Alright. So I'm hearing there's this fourth dining hall ]¶ which has a mural on it ¶ representing Homer's Odyssey.ù No, I'm not saying you're crazy! But you have to admit that's a bit unbelievable. I mean, all the other dining halls are normal, and you're saying that this one just has a random piano plopped down in it that just any random person can play. I hate to ask this, but, like ¶ Were you on anything when you went to this Ortegaù? Did you just get lost somewhere and find some food in a dumpster? I know sometimes when you have a hard time focusing, you like to take long walks and explore. Did you just wander into a new restaurant in Isla Vista? Maybe this was something you thought of in a dream? I do believe you! But when you're just making up places that I've never heard before, it's a little suspicious. Okay, I get it ¶ is this a bit? C'mooooon, stop playing around, babe. Let's get some real dinner to take your mind off of all this.† Can't believe you almost made me fall for it! But you know nothing gets past me.

It can't be ¶ It is! A pile of slop, green and gurgling on a cheap, off-white plate! This can only mean one thing: Ortega's Fall 2021 slop has dropped, and not a moment too late.† It's been over a year since our quivering lips have felt the embrace of the Ortega Slop Tube, and it's a shame, for some of my fondest memories at UC Santa Barbara have stemmed from the ol' Slop Drop. I mean, who doesn't feel a twinge of nostalgia looking back on those hungover Sunday mornings, pumping your gullet full of some throbbing slop straight from the chute? The sense of community built by passing the tube to your fellow student, meeting eyes while gurgling that gloppy good-good and declaring, Damn! That's some slop!ù is integral to the UCSB experience. Luckily, with the university planning to open up this fall, we hungry little goblins won't have to wait much longer for our chunky treat. Ortega has already begun finalizing the recipe, and as Nexustentialism's food correspondent, I had the supreme honor of getting a sneak peak at the new slop. Allow me to be the first to tell you: It HITS.† I arrived at Ortega under the cover of darkness, as instructed. I knocked at the door three times and was immediately whisked inside, blindfolded and led to the middle of the dining common. Upon removing the blindfold, I found myself at a candlelit table with only a spoon in front of me. I looked up at the horrific mural that graces Ortega's walls and thanked whatever gods were out there for this opportunity.† Unfortunately, due to COVID-protocals, I couldn't lip the tube. Bummer! No matter though; I soon heard its familiar chugging and, within moments, a plate of pulsating, frothy slime was wavering in front of me. Bon appetit!† The first bite of slop transported me to a beautiful Eden, where sweet, salty and umami danced around naked, frolicking euphoric through patches of daisies. It also tasted a lot like dirt, which helped with the garden imagery. The next few bites were equally as transformative. I tried to have a word with the chef to see what combination of ingredients could have created something so incredible, but he only grunted and made vaguely threatening gestures in response.† In case you're building a list of things to look forward to when we go back to in-person learning, you have to add this! I've always said that slop should be more than a meal ¶ it should be an experience, and Ortega's Fall 2021 slop fits the bill perfectly.† † Chace Duma wants sloppy toppy, hold the toppy

The move comes after extensive use of culture's generous policies, which permitted an unlimited number of free cancellations. All of you are why we can't have nice things. We tried to do a good thing and let anyone cancel people that deserved it, but y'all had to go and ruin it,ù† the irate CEO explained. After a short grace period, we will begin charging a cancellation fee directly to the canceller's culture account. This measure will deter widespread overuse and ensure that there are still enough people around that we can turn a profit. After all, we're not running a charity here, people.ù The announcement led to a tumultuous morning on the markets. With only a few weeks of free cancellations left, financial analysts predicted a sharp uptick of incredibly credible workplace misconduct allegations. As these reports broke, hundreds of hedge fund managers fled trading desks in order to call their lawyers, publicists and significant others (in that order). One Republican financier broke down into tears. W-w-w-without cancel c-culture h-how will we have a national party??!?ù he asked, aghast. Despite these strong reactions from the financial sector, some details of the new policy remain unclear. When asked about how much culture would be charging for each cancellation, the CEO of culture explained that not every cancellation will incur the same fee. We recognize, of course, that some cancellations are more important than others. For example, the cancellation fee is automatically waived for anyone who says that they are a òvictim of cancel culture.' Those cancellations are on the house, as a part of culture's public service initiativesù the CEO said. May 31, 2021 will be the final day of free cancellations î so remember to cancel everyone you need to before then. † Varun Iyer is waiting to cancel people until there is a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

Say goodbye to doing nerdy shit like fact-checkingù and critical thinkingù because who needs either when you can lightly peruse a Canva graphic for your weekly dose of geopolitical tumult?† However, this new surge in popularity of activism-adjacent paraphernalia has led to the overproduction of Instagram infographics to the point of market saturation, causing demand to drop dramatically. This new pressure on designers has caused some of them to adopt creative techniques and quirks in order to carve out a niche for themselves. Local Canva enthusiast and self-proclaimed fighter against the machineù Tolula Johansson (Txlxlx Jxhxnssxn) has set herself apart from the competition by pioneering the replacement of any and all vowels with the letter X.ù While I recognize that the letter Xù is commonly used to include the representation of gender-fluidity like with the term òLatinx,' I thought, why stop there?ù When told that this stunt could potentially harm the LGBTQ+ community through its mockery and misuse of the letter X,ù Johansson scoffed. Hey, I'm an ally. My friend Peter is gay.ù Peter declined to comment when contacted.† UC Santa Barbara student and avid infographic reposter Andy Goliath laments this phenomenon. Gone are the days when one could post a black square with the hashtags #activism and #endracism and then move on with their life and maybe grab mimosas or something.ù Andy sighed dramatically.

Pregamers are more excited than ever to leave the place with all of their friends and cheap alcohol and pay a stranger dozens of dollars to drive them to a secondary location with the same friends and more expensive alcohol. We spoke to one excited partygoer named George H.W. Leyte, allegedly a 22-year-old student from the state of Rhode Island.† Bro I'm literally soooo psyched for this. Our Uber driver was all like, òYo, downtown is on fire right now,' and the whole car literally cheered, and then he was like, òNo, like it's literally on fire,' and we were like, òHELL YEAH! That's why we're here, you know,' and anywayù î at this point, Leyte paused for a long slurp from a nicotine sticotine î we're gonna tear it the fuck up bro.ù† Bolstered by unilaterally positive sentiments from the pregaming community, this reporter ventured out into Santa Barbara himself in order to confirm reports that downtown was indeed on fire î and confirmed it was. You could hear the screams and shrieks of partiers from miles away. The steady wail and flashing lights of sirens proved that this was no average night on the town. State Street was swarming with exotic dancers that demonstrated an exceptional dedication to their firefighting costumes î the perfect complement to a lit evening. Having witnessed the thriving night firsthand, this reporter encourages any and all readers to make their way downtown for a night that will certainly be remembered. † Varun Iyer is currently pregaming with gusto.

Winfrey's keynote address will certainly inspire and compel the newest generation of real-adult Gauchos (a near oxymoron in terms) to ever-greater heights.† In a preliminary interview today, Nexustentialism reporters learned that Winfrey shares a common experience with many Gauchos. Winfrey, like all of us, agreed to come to UCSB amid the tears and existential crises brought on by a UCLA rejection letter. Winfrey shared a copy of the letter, which read: The director did not respond to a request for comment. Winfrey î like every other dejected Gaucho î is left without answers. Winfrey recounted the incident while attempting to restrain the tears welling in her eyes: I don't think I've ever been the same since. Yes, I'm a self-made multibillionaire and the greatest cultural tastemaker since Jesus î but I was really pinning my entire self-worth on UCLA, so this letter just shattered my confidence.ù This Nexustentialism reporter tendered his condolences to Winfrey, helping the butlers dry her tears and assuring the multibillionaire that her trauma was very much shared. When asked if he knew about Winfrey's recent rejection, Chancellor Henry T. Yang positively beamed. Yes, we were well aware of the unfortunate news, but we are proud to continue a long-standing Gaucho tradition of embracing UCLA rejects. UCLA may be handsome, charming and funny, but when UCLA rejects you, UCSB will always be a shoulder to cry on î and, with time, maybe something more. My wife Dilling Yang and I are grateful for the rejection and excited for the wisdom that Oprah will impart to the many, many Gauchos that have preceded her.ù Varun Iyer has never thought about what his life might look like if UCLA had seen him for who he truly was.

His eyes begin to well up with tears, as they often do in men who don't allow themselves to cry. His muscles grow tense. He lets his fingertips drag along the tops of each bicycle seat as he moves past them, as if to say God, I miss her.ù After all, Cherry was stolen.† Or so Peddler thought. Cherry had it all. Nine speeds, a comfy seat, and a bangin' basket. At first, Cherry and Peddler had so much fun together going to classes, restaurants, even booty calls. It was not uncommon to see Cherry and Peddler ride off together into the sunset; it was the kind of love you might see in the classic man-and-his-bike romance movie. They were inseparable. Inseparable, that is, until they weren't. Over time, Cherry's lock got rusty. She started slowing down. But Peddler, rather than listen to the screech of her tires, kept pressing on î kept pushing Cherry to her limit. This went on until, one fateful night, Peddler forgot to lock his beautiful bike boo. She saw an opportunity, and she left. She wheeled herself away with nothing but a bell, a basket and a dream, in search of a rider who would treat her with the dignity she deserved.† Peddler still longs for a bike like Cherry. As he stared out upon the rainbow of bikes before him at the boutique, he could not help but reminisce on the one set of wheels that truly had it all. He was only awakened from his trance when a store associate interrupted to ask, Hey! Did you find one? Are you ready to check out?ù Peddler, still facing the bikes, shed a single tear. He turned his head to face the associate. No,ù he choked out, meekly. Not yet.ù Natalie Kothergirls has been described as a passionate rider

One of these luxuries, as if returning students need to be told, is the Ortega Dining Commons. Known for both its unbeatable ambiance and five-star dishes, Ortega is more than a cafeteria î it is a place of community, of luxury and, in the spring/summer, a sought-after wedding venue. Of all the dishes new students should be on the lookout for when reveling in the Ortega experience, here are Nexustentialism's all-time faves. Meat Cube A timeless classic, Meat CubeÑ¢ just can't be beat. This dish will have you thinking, What type of meat is this? And why can't I pin down the flavor?ù The answer to both? We're legally not allowed to disclose that information! Meat cube runs S-XL, so you can curb your appetite with a cube no matter how hungry you are.† Bowl of Water This crowd pleaser is an innovative take on the classic gazpacho. Ortega chefs insist that this dish was in fact heavily requested by students and not created due to a tight budget. Raw Fried Chicken† A beautiful little paradox.† Liquid Tostada† The perfect lunch for the girl on the go! No need to waste energy moving those chompers when you can just slurp your meal down. Not only is the liquid tostada renowned for its convenience, but some say the consistency of the dish actually elicits a rich umami flavor that can't be found in your traditional tostada.† Little Lettuce Piece Get some greens with this popular go-to! The best thing about Little Lettuce Piece is that you never know which piece of the lettuce you're going to get. Will it be the top layer with the bug holes? Or maybe the very bottom? Your fate lies in the hands of the great Ortega and the students your age that make the stuff in there. Though the thrill of the surprise is almost as good as the dish itself, there's no beating the fresh taste of a limp lettuce piece paired with something we can't legally call ranch.† Shark Fins† This one is not a joke.† † Emma Demorest is a huge foodie and hopes to pursue a career in culinary journalism.†

The accident sent shock waves through the Isla Vista community not only due to the farcical nature of the collision, but also because when confronted with so many people with such a unique and quirky interest in one place, these roller skaters realized that there was no way they could all be the main character. The crowd of former John Green-readers looked around, deeply distraught to find their senses of cinematic individuality in jeopardy as those around them appeared as funhouse mirrors in the Isla Vistan sun.

Wiessass // DAILY NEXUS A new report that dropped this week from the UC Santa Barbara Bee Studies department indicates that local bee populations have been declining at alarming rates since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many have been both shocked and saddened by this news, but also deeply surprised by the reason behind this decline. Experts speculate that many of these bees would have been spared if only CALPIRG volunteers would have been able to continue harassing innocent Gauchos as they walked about campus. Many students are looking at the group differently after getting word of this report. I just thought they were virgins with clipboards,ù third-year Pauline Ation said. I never realized that they were the only people holding us back from total ecological collapse.ù† Environmentalists, soft-boy hipsters and gays who instinctively flock to any kind of queen bee have all been deeply affected by this news. Some within these groups and others have looked to set up fundraisers and other kinds of events to help rehabilitate local bee populations, but many experts feel that these renewed efforts may be too little, too late. WE FUCKING TOLD YOU,ù James L'orax, president of the UCSB chapter of CALPIRG, said. YOU THINK WE WERE STANDING AROUND EMBARRASSING OURSELVES FOR OUR OWN FUCKING HEALTH?ù he demanded, teary-eyed. Local activists have reached out to various bee-themed celebrities in the hopes that they may bring a heightened level of awareness to this issue. However at the time of writing, Beyonc√©, Burt (of Burt's Bees fame) and even Sting have failed to weigh in on the issue. Nexustentialism reached out to various local hives for comment but received no response î unless you count multiple cases of anaphylactic shock and a jar of artisan honey as a response. † A. Wiessass is wondering what all this buzz is about.

The handy followed ironically byù list on their profile lets friends know you don't actually support this person but just want to see their stupid posts more easily. Many have found the ironic followù feature incredibly useful, especially to see the content of embarrassing childhood obsessions, users spreading conspiracy theories people think might be onto something and artists that your friends trash, but you secretly enjoy (This one's for you, Meghan Trainor fans!). Along with the ironic followù feature, Instagram also added an ironic bookmarkù feature so users can come back to dumb posts they want to make fun of. Whenever I bookmark an insane keto recipe, like a hunk of cream cheese as a snack, Instagram's algorithm thinks that I wanna make it!ù nutrition major Shane Ray said. Now I can clown on these wackadoos in peace and not have my explore page show me a million combinations of avocado, sour cream and peanut butter.ù This ironicù update has not been without its hurt feelings, however. Emotions have run high in those users who have found out that others have ironically saved their content. All I did was post a picture of me and my boyfriend on our one month-iversary, declaring our status as soulmates,ù Stephanie Bethany said. Someone ironically bookmarked my post, and it's, like, made me realize how sad and bitter all of these haters are!ù The ironic followù feature is also incredibly useful for keeping tabs on people who you may clash with professionally. On a leaked call, American disgrace and rookie U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was heard referencing the ironic followù feature when she said that I use it to follow Obama because he's so goddamned sexy.ù The justice continued by saying, If my friends or coworkers found out I have a thing for the guy after trying to destroy his legislative legacy, I'd be in some pretty hot water!ù† Barrett and many other users can rest easy at night knowing they can still see their content discreetly without any of the judgements one might face when popping up under that followed byù button.† † Sam Franzini wishes Instagram would take a hint.

Wiessass // Daily Nexus Warnings, panic and general hubbub about the new Delta strain of COVID-19 have been dominating the news cycle over the past few weeks. Envious of all the attention showered on Delta, local Zeta Beta Tau brother Chad Brohanski took it upon himself to bring his local, small-town fraternity chapter into the national spotlight. Brohanski has been spending the last three weeks attempting to cultivate a novel Zetaù strain of COVID-19. When asked why on God's green earth he would do such a thing, Brohanski responded, You know, I just couldn't stand hearing more and more about this Delta thing, bro. For weeks, it was fuckin' Delta this, Delta that î it was driving me crazy man. I kept hearing this shit, and, you know, a man's got a limit. I knew I had to do something about it. The only way I could possibly drown out the garbage was by building an even better strain of the virus î more contagious, more lethal î that would get people talking about Zeta, dude. So, you know, I just started stroking my Storke into some Petri dishes and seeing what would happen, you know?ù Isla Vista's Greek community was shocked î shocked, I tell you î to hear that Brohanski could get caught doing such a reprehensible thing. Nexustentialism's Greek life reporter, Vassilis Koutroulakis, was unable to find a representative of the Greek community who could comment on the matter but wanted to inform the reader that Greece's borders are once again open for international travel and that there is nothing quite like sipping a tsipouro with the feeling of the Mediterranean breeze on one's face. Editor's note: After Nexustentialism's initial publication of this story, Senator Rand Paul informed our offices that he would immediately open an inquiry into the National Institutes of Health and any involvement they may have had in Brohanski's gain-of-function research. We called Dr. Anthony Fauci for comment, but he could not be reached, as he was reportedly opening for Olivia Rodrigo. † Varun Iyer feels bad about writing this article because all of the fraternity brothers he knows are upstanding young gentlemen.

daily-stench,UCSB Classroom Buildingù To Be Unveiled Along With Sitting Chairsù and Talking Podiumsù,25-Aug-21,4:20 AM,['Miss Informed'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-25/ucsb-classroom-building-to-be-unveiled-along-with-sitting-chairs-and-talking-podiums/," Do you often find yourself utterly bewildered as to the function of everyday objects? Are you also disillusioned with the barren landscape of our fine institution? Well, you're in luck, because for the first time in over 50 years, we have a brand spanking new Classroom Buildingù set to be unveiled in spring 2023! You may be thinking, It's literally named òClassroom Building'? What an ingenious name. I never could have ascertained the function of this building on my own!ù And you're not the only student who feels this way. According to Chancellor Henry T. Yang, most UCSB students can't figure out why things exist and what they do. That is why this new building will not only increase our overall classroom capacity by over 35%, but it will also include practical accommodations such as sitting chairsù and talking podiumsù in each beautiful new room. Gone are the days when you'd have to sneakily ask your seat partner what the function of the strange bright things in the ceiling are for, because this new building will include illuminating lightsù that will ease your mind once and for all!† Sophomore Carly Stevens sees this as a great opportunity to familiarize herself with what things do. I've never critically thought about what types of buildings are even on the campus of a university; it's just not something someone would consider, you know? Thank god they're gonna put Classroom Buildingù in big shiny letters on the front because otherwise, I'd forget why I was entering it by the time I'm halfway across the main hall.ù She sighs happily, I'll finally be able to stop muttering, òI'm going to class, I'm going to class, I'm going to class,' as a personal reminder over and over again under my breath while I walk to Introduction to Biology!ù With the construction of this new building, we are reminded that while the UCSB community may be gifted in shotgunning Four Lokos on a Tuesday afternoon, where we truly shine is with providing our students with basic learning accommodations probably about 10 years too late, while also calling each and every one of them a fucking moron.† † Miss Informed has never physically taken a class at UCSB before, so she is relieved for the clarification.

daily-stench,Incoming Freshman Leaks Own SSN To Integrate Into Campus Culture,26-Aug-21,4:20 AM,['A. Wiessass'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-26/incoming-freshman-leaks-own-ssn-to-integrate-into-campus-culture/," This last year and a half has been one of solitude and alienation, so it makes sense that many are looking for ways to connect themselves to their community. Here at UC Santa Barbara, many new students are proactively seeking out clubs and activities that will introduce them to future friends and to real Gauchohood. One incoming freshman has gone above and beyond in his efforts to find his fit on campus and has leaked his own social security number in order to find common ground with elder Gauchos. That's right, freshman Lee K. Enfaux voluntarily put his SSN as well as other sensitive information on the dark web as he felt that it might bring him closer to his fellow Isla Vistans.ù As we all know the UC system's virtual security proved to be less like a vault and more like a colander in terms of keeping in its contents after a data breach in December 2020. However, only some then-applicants, now-acceptees were affected by the breach and unluckily Enfaux was not one of the chosen.† It just kinda sucked,ù Enfaux said. Like, there are so many ways I already felt separated from my classmates, I really didn't need another.ù It was this mindset that led Enfaux to his decision to compromise his sensitive data. Many are criticizing Enfaux's move, predicting that he has likely caused himself a great deal of trouble down the road by leaking his information, but us at Nexustentialism see it differently. After more than four quarter's worth of on-and-off lockdowns, social distancing, medical scares, fundamental loneliness and Zoom-induced psychotic breaks we think it is perfectly reasonable that someone, like Enfaux, would go out of their way to find points of connection with those around them, especially as the prospect of heading towards in-person instruction looms over us all. We admit Enfaux's decision to leak his data was dumb, but it was the kind of dumb that makes UCSB special. It was dumb with heart. A. Wiessass has transcended the need for a social security number and now only identifies himself via dance.

If Mrs. Yang doesn't receive a phone call from her son soon, she'll assume the worst: Her son has made his debut on DLG's exquisite menu. As for Mr. Yang î well, let's just say he would appreciate a fellow fish to keep him company.†† The Yangs have yet to receive any form of communication or sign from their cryptid son since his last sighting two decades ago. Maybe Swamp Yang is a coy fish? Or perhaps there's a more pernicious reason as to why he prefers the tenebrous depths of the lagoon over the craftsman-style Yang household. To get the full story, this Nexustenialism reporter interviewed the lagoon monster's parents, diving into the family dynamics of our favorite aquatic specimen.† At the mention of her currently missing-in-action son, Mrs. Yang scoffed, He just doesn't have the decency to check in every once in a while for my sake. No calls, no nothing î it's as if he doesn't exist!ù After a brief pause, Mrs. Yang frowned disheartedly, I never would've thought that the chances of me seeing Bigfoot and my own son would be equal.ù Mr. Yang swished his fins in agreement. This Nexustenialism reporter nodded solemnly, watching Mr. Yang nibbling on some rainbow fish food from the corner of her eye.† As much as it pains her to admit it, Mrs. Yang is under the assumption that her son left the comfort of his childhood home to escape his dad's overbearing judgement. She recalls several occasions in which the household would erupt in one-sided arguments over trivial matters.† He assumed that he wasn't good enough for his dad to talk to him, but that's not the case at all,ù she remarked staunchly. His dad is just ¶ù She paused for a minute, taking care to procure mild-mannered words to describe her spouse ¶ difficult to talk to sometimes. But he's not a bad father!ù Mr. Yang vacantly stared outside of his tank; the sound of his tank filter supplanted the unbearable silence.† While Mr. and Mrs. Yang continue to wait for a good morning text from their son, this reporter suggests you, for the sake of your parents' well-being, try to call home every once in a while.† † H.L.

At this very moment, UC Santa Barbara students of all ages are feeling mixes of excitement, apprehension, melancholy and horniness. But one age group has a unique feeling to add to the cauldron: social-anxiety-based dread. Current fourth years are, en masse, jubilant to return to campus and experience one last year in the presence of their fellow Gauchos before being thrust out into the real world like a sofa on a DP curb. However, as the group that has spent the longest on campus, we also know the most people and ergo hate the most people. With our return to in-person instruction, we all know we are bound to see that one bitch that can make our blood run cold and boil simultaneously.† I've had almost two years at home to stew on this shit,ù said Holden Grugess, whose ex dumped him in a GauchoSpace forum. Some people would have forgiven and forgotten after all this time, but not me. I'm angrier and pettier than ever.ù Having attended the university in some way or another for three years, us fourth years have collected a hefty list of people that we would rather guzzle lagoon water than ever have to see again. Whether it's the rambunctious know-it-all from section, that sloppy frat star who finished faster than the gubernatorial recall election or the ex-roommate that cultivated an environment so inhospitable that Death Valley started looking like a nice place to spend a summer.†††† I swear to god if I see Mckkaeleighah in the line at the Arbor, I am grabbing her by the backpack and leaving her in the middle of the snack aisle like a desolate turtle,ù said Stacy Tortue, a fourth year who wanted to clarify that she would never do that to a real turtle.ù After all this time away from campus, it's nice to know some things never change.

The hospital now features an ICU ward fully furnished with bunk beds. Reyes explained that the hospital had been inspired by efforts pioneered at UC Santa Barbara. Practical research conducted in residence halls throughout the university showed that the best solution to overcrowding was simply to double down, fitting two people in a space clearly designed for one. Reyes explained the hospital's rationale in investing in this newly furnished ward by saying, We expect an explosion in ICU hospitalizations from all three of our largest market sectors: binge drinking freshmen, pile-up bike collisions and COVID-19 cases. This investment ensures that the hospital is prepared to receive all those who need it with open arms and $900 ambulance rides.ù When asked why an ambulance ride costs so much money, Reyes winked and whispered, That's our little secret.ù† Patients at Cottage reportedly enjoy the new bunk bed experience. In addition to inter-patient intercourse skyrocketing 76%, patient morale seems to have been boosted by the new project as well. It's just like being a kid again,ù one patient said. Because I get to be up high when I sleep, and I don't have to wipe my own ass.ù† Nexustentialism field reporter Sam Penn got to examine the new beds firsthand, describing the experience atop the raised bunk as preciousù and reminiscent of his childhood watching Ninjago and not having friends,ù as well as mildly fear-striking at the thought of contracting a serious illness from a used ICU bed.ù One patient, Corinne Avirus, expressed that she was disappointedù at the lack of slides coming down from the bunk beds, insisting on jumping down from the top in protest. Avirus was then put in timeout by an on-duty nurse.† Doctors have also discussed future plans of implementing step-stools to the top bunk to increase access to patient's foreheads for goodnight kisses. Side tables will also be available for cookies and a glass of warm milk. Fruit gummies will be available for patients with especially good behavior.† Waking up the morning after a diagnosis of alcohol poisoning, first-year UCSB student Newman Sterdam was filled with excitement. This place is awesome,ù he exclaimed. And it's way bigger than my octuple in Anacapa. How much is rent?ù† Reyes did not comment on the potential for double-decker ambulance vehicles but gave the press a sly smile and a shoulder shimmy, inviting them back to next week's press conference for more details to come.† Varun Iyer and Sierra Vakili aren't hospitalized, but they are sick as fuck.† † A version of this article appeared on p. 17 of the Sept. 23, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

I don't know how to talk to people anymore, haha!ù† However, if we were to approach this issue critically, it seems like there is no way to determine whether quarantine is truly the cause behind our shared social plight or if we are actually, at our core, really fucking weird. Fret not, dear reader, for this handy guide is here to help you differentiate between a bad social streak and being a permanent freak! Ordering at Restaurants Bad Social Streak: Sometimes simply ordering food can make you want to dissipate into a fine mist that never reassumes a human form. However, if you say, You too!ù when the waiter wishes you a nice meal, or if you pronounce Filet Mignonù like Fill-et Mig-nunù, those are the marks of temporary social faux-pas.† Permanent Freak: Pissing your pants, like a little pee-pee bitch baby. Oh yeah? You just looove pissing your pants, huh? How about you sit in your disgusting little wet pants and think about what you've done, you pathetic fucking worm. Bumping into a Friend in Public Bad Social Streak: We've all been there; do you say hello and make terribly awkward small talk about what they're doing and where they're going, or do you bow your head and pretend you didn't see them? If you do end up making the wrong choice by stopping to say hi, the occasional lapse in conversation while you both stare at your shoes is perfectly normal and a typical sign of a bad social streak. Permanent Freak: Look at all that fucking piss running down your leg, you filthy cumbucket. How about you crawl over here and lick Mommy's boot, you gross little freak? You're good for nothing except pissing your fucking pants and you know it, don't you? Going to a Work Party Bad Social Streak: Work parties are right up there with in-law dinner parties and middle-school dances as some of the worst parties ever, and they're often made worse by the combination of watered-down office sangria and the fact that you hate all of your coworkers. With all of this in mind, the occasional forgotten name (Oh you're Gary? I'm so sorry, I thought your name was Larry!ù) or a drunken conversation with your boss can be excused as just a bad social streak. Permanent Freak: Yeah, lick it up you little fucking slut. Lick it all up. I know you're fucking thirsty; you're always wanting more, aren't you? You better not stop òtill you can see your reflection in this fucking floor or you'll have to take your punishment lying down, you worthless piss-baby. Hopefully this guide has illustrated the slight, but crucial differences between a post-quarantine slip-up and being an inherent fuck-up! Now go out there, have fun, and be safe! Or don't, because you may be a menace to society. † Miss Informed wants to clarify that this article is a joke and she does not have any morbid kinks that she acts out in public.

UC Santa Barbara has just announced that to solve the upcoming fall housing crisis, student dorms will now be packed with six-to-eight friendly faces waiting to welcome you to your new home. The new regulation will accommodate all of the new students/customers the university admitted last year, when they forgot students were real people that unfortunately take up physical space and not just Zoom boxes. Not only have they fixed housing, but students have been saved from the pervading feelings of loneliness and isolation that Zoom school breeds! With up to 10 students in one room, incoming freshmen will never feel alone again! After the wildly successful smiley face initiative, Counseling & Psychological Services worked with the university to ensure their wellness programs continued to promote student wellbeing. We're so excited about the opportunity of having a baker's dozen students in one dorm,ù the Director of Student Friendship Susan Poleman told Nexustentialism. Studies show physical touch is crucial for human relationships, and in our new configuration, you're bound to be touching at least two random body parts at all times.ù Students everywhere are celebrating the decision and getting to know their new roommates. Me and my 14 new besties do everything together!ù first-year Rebecca Jillian said. Sarah D., Sara J., Sarah L, Sarah M. and I call ourselves the fridge girls because we're always smushed in that area. It's always a competition to see who can get to the Brita first!ù she said, laughing. However, there are some slight disadvantages to the new program, including questions on if this is enough space for a college-age adult to occupy. When Matt's 6:45 a.m. alarm turns on, it wakes everyone up because it takes him a while to crawl over the mass of bodies that are in the room at all times,ù Kyle Damon said. It's especially confusing when my girlfriend's over. She's like, òHey Kyle!' and all three of us answer.ù† Despite minor setbacks, freshmen are bound to notice how much happier and less lonely they'll be in the months to come. UCSB assures that you'll never go to the dining hall, lectures or the gym alone with their new slogan: The only campus that guarantees 18 automatic friends!ù Once again, UCSB has shown that when it comes to solving the many crises students face, they're always ready to tackle the challenge. † Sam Franzini is extremely relieved he never has to step foot in a dorm again.

For this apparent flatulence fiend terrorizing Girvetz 2115, sphincter control appears to have been an oversight in the shift from online classes.† What's so absurd about it is that he shows no remorse, none at all,ù reports a bewildered witness from the scene. The toot rips out with a cacophonous boom, unapologetic, cascading, strong enough to move mountains, loud enough to deafen all the ears.

daily-stench,No Eating Indoorsù Rule Disappoints Local Whores,7-Oct-21,4:20 AM,['Natalie Kothergirls'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-07/101383/,"J. MATTEO WHARTON // DAILY NEXUS UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ì Mask up, Gauchos! There's a new sheriff in town by the name of Corona Virus, and she's a feisty dominatrix with a thing for masks. Given the cruel circumstances of Ms. Rona's reign, UC Santa Barbara has got some new rules in place, one of which is keeping that gosh-darned face covering on at all times (including over your nose, Jonathan). As a result, no eating is permitted in indoor spaces, a rule that evoked a fiery rage from campus' arguably most radical anti-mask community: the whores who engage in public cunnilingus.† I'm totally gonna miss getting sucked off in the lib,ù said some guy who has definitely never gotten sucked off in the lib. Now I have to keep my mask on to ensure the safety of myself and those around me, especially at-risk groups like immunocompromised broskis and homies over the age of 70. Like, what the fuck, dude?ù the guy roared, some of his saliva landing on our Nexustentialism field reporter. Our reporter's COVID-19 rapid test came back negative. However, some slutty Gauchos agree that sacrifices need to be made in these times for the sake of everyone's safety. It's an easy choice, you know?ù fourth-year student Igor Taboner said. There are two options: spreading an infectious disease or wearing a mask while I go down on my girlfriend in a study room. Seems pretty obvious to me.ù† Other students, however, aren't as lucky. Second-year student Fia Latio Zoomed in from UCSB isolation housing to tell Nexustentialism about the risks of indoor dick-eating. I thought it was just going to be regular exhibitionism on eigth, but then he gave me COVID!ù Latio said, breaking down in tears. I wish I had worn a mask!ù When push comes to shove, some Gauchos have been forced to take up crafty solutions. They never said no drinking!ù exclaimed an anonymous Gaucho with a straw.† To mitigate COVID-19 exposure risk, whores are advised to take their public oral sex to alternative outdoor locations, such as library patios, the UCen lawn or good old-fashioned Campus Point. However, University Library administrators know that this rule probably won't stop some of you. Anyway, just make sure to be safe, get consent and wear that mask.† † Natalie Kothergirls is hungry.† A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the Oct. 7, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

daily-stench,The Official Nexustentialism Guide for the Bike Path,14-Oct-21,4:20 AM,['Sam Franzini'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-14/the-official-nexustentialism-guide-for-the-bike-path/,"†  Welcome back, UCSB! Boy, oh boy, are there a lot of rules in regard to coming back safely, especially since there are so many new people here. Lecture time is almost over, but hear me out, the bike path is one of the most integral parts of the UCSB campus, so it's important to navigate it correctly! If you're a new freshman, Nexustentialism has you covered with the only guide you'll need to get to your classes in no time. Oopsie! Don't walk there! Many make the mistake of walking on the bike path due to its nice asphalt and pretty yellow lines, but watch out! It's just for bikes! Tricycles always have the right of way. Because they're so little and adorable, UCSB students always let the gaggle of toddlers who ride their tricycles go by first since they have to go home from day care. Don't want Starbucks mommies to punish their tardy tots! The bike paths are closed every day due to maintenance from 5-5:30 a.m., which impacts practically nobody except sickos who workout in the wee hours of the morning just to say they can. Do not attempt the loop-de-loop.†† One time there was this student attempting an art project on the bike path, trying to make it a metaphor for our commercialized society and how we're always in a rush or something. Someone got mad and they ran into her, and she went flying so far into space she made national headlines because no one has ever done an art project in space before. UCSB dedicated a memorial tombstone in her memory, so when you see it on the way to Girvetz, say Hi Shelby!ù This isn't a rule or anything, new students should just learn their history.† Sunday is Twin Day! If you aren't riding alongside someone, the Bike Patrol can and will push you off.† If you see Gorgoth the Bike Gremlin, don't follow him into his lair. It looks cool, but many new students have perished trying to enter his slimy abode. He will lure you. But you need to play it cool, remember that you have many T-shirts at home, you do not need one more and then calmly bike past. If you do mistakenly enter Gorgoth's lair, he has dinner from 4:30-9 p.m everyday. (What a fatty, am I right? But he feasts on young students for sustenance. Best not to mention his abundance of food, he's quite self-conscious about his weight still.) This is your chance to quietly sneak out of the sludge-drenched cavern and escape. And if you have two months to spare, you can wait for an appointment with UCSB Counseling & Psychological Services to get through your trauma. Don't look at your phone on the bike path! Social media use has been proven to increase loneliness, anxiety and depression in teens. Instead, choose a healthy option like reading a book or preparing a delicious salad while you ride to class. We hope these tips will help you during your travels this year! Best to print this out and stick it in a notebook somewhere to remember. † Sam Franzini doesn't remember people being this dumb two years ago.

daily-stench,UCSB Library Adds Two New Sides: Tree and Rock,14-Oct-21,4:20 AM,['Kathleen Santacruz'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-14/ucsb-library-adds-two-new-sides-tree-and-rock/," In a continuation of their efforts to keep students on their toes amid a pandemic and university-sponsored housing crisis, UC Santa Barbara has decided to add two new sides to the library. The new sides, entitled Tree and Rock, will be joining Ocean and Mountain in an effort to create balance between the elements within the University Library. Now shaped as a hexagon, the library offers new additions that hold a lot in store for students at UCSB who were perfectly fine with the way it was before.† Dedicated to that one rock by the Arbor and some tree that looks like all of the other trees on campus, the new sides of the library have already made an impact on student life. With more space for the cultivation of a harmonious existence between library frequenters, such as people pretending to do work and those trying to escape from their roommates, the library has come closer to achieving equilibrium among students than ever before. This was disrupted, though, when the additional decorative features to the new sides of the library were removed following complaints from urgent care about people tripping over rocks in the middle of the hallways.† With the additions being the university's newest effort to promote itself as a top university for diversity and inclusion, Chancellor Henry T. Yang has stated that the significance of the new Tree and Rock sections was to promote the well-being of students who found themselves existing as a part of the marginalized community that doesn't enjoy the ocean or the mountains, having therefore chosen to attend UCSB for reasons such as rejection from UCLA or because of some science program or something. These students are now having their experiences acknowledged and appreciated through the provision of excellent views of trees and rocks,ù Yang stated. You can't get much better than that.ù † Kathleen Santacruz prefers to study in the Rock section of the library because she knows what it feels like to have nothing to offer.

I first noticed it about halfway through week two,ù a slightly distraught Alex said. I was walking through the dining hall when I heard some girl tell her friend, òUgh, Alex is so hard.' I checked and double-checked my pants. Nothing there.ù The situation only got more complicated from there. Later that week, I was talking to a group of guys that said they couldn't go out that weekend because they were too busy doing Alex,ù he said, a tear slowly sliding down his cheek. So I cleared my schedule and everything and they never showed up. They said something about homework. Happened with girls, too.ù Unaware that the Aleks they were referring to is a common homework platform for chemistry, Alex, a first-year classics major, continued.†† People say they're doing Alex all the time. Who the hell is this Alex? And how is he so good at getting it?? Because they sure as hell aren't talking about me!ù Alex cried, basically sobbing at this point. I know it's a common name, but GOD. It's like I'm being led on by the entire campus.ù Alex nervously mentioned off the record that he has been taking free condoms from the Safe Sex tables outside the library and is growing increasingly disheartened that he has repeatedly almost found uses for them.† Despite all this, what upsets Alex the most are the repeated attacks on his character and references to his genitals. They always say I'm hard. It's never anything nice about me. Never, òOh, Alex is so sweet, I would love to get to know him better.' Never, òOh, Alex is such a great guy to be around!' Never, òI'm so glad to have Alex in my life!' Nope. It's always that I'm hard,ù he said, flipping the table we were using for the interview. I haven't gotten a boner in years!ù† At this point, Alex was deemed unfit to continue with the interview. He left the room, as expected, fully flaccid. Probably. † Amon Gus is a new recruit for the Daily Nexus. He first hopped on the scene when he first hopped on the scene and has been hopping on said scene since.†

Two bodies of water on one campus? It's absurd to think we got away with it for so long! Well, the day of reckoning has come. Much to the dismay of many sunbathers, amateur scuba divers and campus bottom feeders, UCSB will be removing the lagoon starting next week.† That's right. Say goodbye to your favorite stinky puddle, to those mysterious, murky depths, beckoning ¶ calling for you ¶ yes ¶ come closer ¶ dip a toe in¶ No! No longer! Our tasty little algae-covered treat will soon be gone for good. Outraged and grieving, we sent our reporters straight to the door of Chancellor Henry T. Yang to see what kind of careful deliberation went into such an impactful decision. I was just kind of over the whole fucking thing, you know?ù Yang said when pressed by our reporters while sucking on the soul of a shriveled-up freshman. Water, plants, fish ¶ it all just seems a little silly, don't you think?ù We pleaded for more information but Yang refused to comply, responding only with a series of unintelligible growls and short whistles. Discouraged but determined, we set our sights on the Lagoon Removal Task Force (LRTF) to search for answers. The whole thing seemed so absurd! How would they go about removing a whole body of water? Our current plan is to give some thirsty little guys a lot of straws and let them go to town,ù claimed the head of the LRTF as they kicked their feet up on the desk, knocking over and spilling a paper-filled jar of validating mantras. Backups include lots of sponges, one big wave and evaporation. Safe to say, we have this under control.ù They took a shaky glance at the mess of folded papers on their desk before taking a deep breath, closing their eyes and whispering, I am enough. I am healing. I am my own superstar.ù†† The university has, of course, received some backlash since going public with this devious scheme. In an act of protest, a couple of brave students anchored themselves to the bottom of the lagoon with their heads bobbing just above the surface. Unfortunately, within a day, their skin had dissolved and their bones joined the rocky floor of the lagoon, leaving nothing behind except the foul stench of sulfur and activism.† One complaint gaining traction among the student body is that the university's funds might be better spent on more pressing matters, like the housing crisis that is currently leaving hundreds of students houseless. When pressed on this issue, Yang responded, Housing crisis? I haven't heard anything about a housing crisis. Are you feeling OK, babe? You're acting super irrational right now.ù Unfortunately, it looks like there's no stopping this train. Make sure to say your final goodbyes to the lagoon and any creatures lurking in its many cracks and mossy crevices. Soon, it will be but a fleeting memory.† Chace Duma forgot to write a byline like a little bitch boy A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the Oct. 21, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

With just one tap, some sophomore in a baggy, red hoodie will come hurtling toward you at break-neck speeds while you press your face against your window, breathing heavily in anticipation of your inbound controlled substance.

What food will be served? Oh my god, band or DJ? Your mind spins out of control. But just as quickly as it began, it's over. You pass, and you feel your heart drop.

My tummy just rumbled î a foreboding sign that the quest to the dining hall is soon to come. We've all dealt with the annoying inconveniences of the dining hall, from not being able to carry all of our food in one trip to waiting in ridiculously long lines just to get something to eat. Most of these problems are unavoidable, as we humans have no way to solve most of our problems. However, if I was an octopus, I would rule the dining hall and be rid of the silly little human ailments we all deal with.† In a nice, little sweater that says octopusù across the front and has eight arm holes, I would floop, floop, floop my way around, arms at the ready. For breakfast, I could schlooop my way up onto the counter and dispense every single kind of cereal at once. With my cereal in hand(s), it would just be a matter of finding a seat, which as an octopus would be no problem since everyone thinks I'm cool and wants to be my friend. My many, many friends would tell you, They are just really tenta-cool.ù Lunch and dinner would be the same. I could easily grab my firsts and seconds plus a drink without breaking a sweat or getting up more than once and thus being forced to once again stare deeply into the eyes of the Carrillo employees, making them instantly fall in love with me.† While grabbing food would be easy, the lines to get to the food, unfortunately, would not disappear just because I am an octopus. Unfortunately for me, everyone wants to stand by me and eat the same food that I am eating so the line follows me wherever I go. You could call me an influencer. However, with my tentacles and their handy suction cups, the lines would be easy to manage. I would simply suction cup your forehead, move you behind me and make my way up the line. While this might upset some, I am an octopus, and hitting me would just be downright rude. An oct of hatred, if you will.† With my beloved followers in tow, the dining hall has quickly changed from being a daily source of anxiety to the place I feel most comfortable. I don't even have to worry about forgetting my Access Card anymore, as it is always stuck to arm number six. As an octopus, I have brought joy and peace to the dining hall not only for myself, but for those around me as well (I am very popular).† They've changed my life for the betterù is something you will hear one of my many friends say. I couldn't have graduated without them.ù Being a human is hard, as we all know, especially when it comes to navigating the dining halls. If you ever find yourself struggling and juggling with your food,† just think of me (I am an octopus), as I floop-flop and squish-shlomp my way around you, showing you just how amazing my life is. My great life is sure to inspire you. Hopefully with me in mind, you, too, can start enjoying the dining hall experience. Faith Talamantez inked a little.

With COVID-19 terrifying everyone and their mother due to the coughing fits around public, the student body is collectively on the constant verge of convulsing as they choose to be teary-eyed and dripping snot, rather than let out any sort of air vomit.† Petrified to break the silence of lecture and draw attention to his musty, crusty self, one unlucky student spontaneously combusted during class while holding in a cough. His explosion was completely overlooked, as the professor was busy arguing with students over if dressing up as a virgin or as Storke Tower is more iconic for Halloween.† Word on the streets of Isla Vista is that a pledge was forced to eat a bat, triggering this year's special edition cough. In an interview with the culprit, Chad Daddy, he claimed, Bro, I swear my brothers told me the bat was chicken, and the shit tasted just like it, so it was obviously valid, bro.ù With no remorse and a complete lack of functioning brain cells, Daddy is honored that òhis' sickness has earned the title of òfrat flu.'† Concentrated around Greek life, this strain of the plague is feeding off of our starved immune systems. After a year of quarantining and intensive mask-wearing, UCSB has taken a òsurvival of the fittest' stance. Throwing endless parties with bodies upon bodies squished into backyards, students are dropping one by one.† Luckily, the suffocating smoke from the Alisal Fire saved the day as an excuse for the dry heaving around campus. Students are arguing that their disgustingly aggressive coughs are simply from the smokey air î not their crippling nicotine addictions, asthma issues nor the numerous illnesses brewing inside them.† Chancellor Yang sees straight through this bullshit excuse and is threatening to reimpose the stay-at-home order. Stay safe, Gauchos.† Ewa Cook is a survivor of the frat flu, she stands with the sick and suffering.†

daily-stench,Isla Vista Residents Throw Christmas Party to Avoid Halloween Restrictions,30-Oct-21,4:20 AM,['Ben Red'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-30/isla-vista-residents-throw-christmas-party-to-avoid-halloween-restrictions/,"Sierra Vakili // Daily Nexus After hearing about the local police ordinance set in place for Halloween, a few innovative UCSB students are planning to throw a Christmas party instead. We kept hearing that I.V. isn't throwing for shit this weekend, but like, when I asked why, everyone just said it was because the cops really hate Halloween. I just thought: Why not throw a Christmas party instead?ù said Garrett, an I.V. resident and UCSB student. Garrett is referring to the Halloween ordinance that is in place this weekend. Officially, due to unruly behavior that usually occurs on Halloween in Isla Vista, the IVPD has decided to set up roadblocks and issue citations to anybody out partying this weekend. These restrictions pose a threat to most parties. We asked Garrett if he was aware of the consequences and he replied with, Yeah, we're just telling everyone to dress up as Christmas characters, but only I can be Santa. That way, when the cops show up, we can just be like, òI don't know what you're talking about officer, this is a Christmas party,' but everyone's in costumes anyway.ù No further questions were asked. To find out whether this idea would actually work, we checked in with officer Niko of IVPD. We made sure to tell him this is all hypothetical of course. Despite popular belief, we don't actually hate Halloween,ù officer Niko stated. We just hate the little shits that think it's funny to dress up as cops. We wish we could just ticket them, but we know people would call us little bitches if they found that out. That's why we're shutting down all of Halloween.ù When asked about whether the police would shut down the Christmas party, That might actually work,ù officer Niko replied. As long as no one's dressed up as a cop, I don't see why that would be a problem.ù However, officer Niko also had this warning to anybody dressed as Santa: Yeah, that naughty and nice shit isn't really in our jurisdiction, but we respect his sense of duty and justice, so I don't wanna see any Santas either.ù Garrett has since been warned and now says he will find a new costume because he didn't really like the Santa idea anyway.ù Ben Red will be at the party dressed as Rudolph, so nobody else dress up as Rudolph.

daily-stench,Architect Pulls Out of Munger Hall Project After Allegations That Munger's Head Just Shaped Wrongù,4-Nov-21,4:20 AM,['Rohan Solanki'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-04/architect-pulls-out-of-munger-hall-project-after-allegations-that-mungers-head-just-shaped-wrong/,"J. Matteo Wharton // Daily Nexus Last week, architect Dennis McFadden made national news after quitting the Munger Hall project. While his public statement cited concerns with the building's design and its lack of ventilation and sunlight, we at Nexustentialism have it on good authority that McFadden resigned due to the fact that Charles Munger's head shape is just too damn weird. That head is not architecturally sound,ù lamented McFadden. He looks like an egg, like a hard-boiled Humpty Dumpty. I was baking a cake and an egg rolled off the counter and cracked on the floor, and I have similar concerns with Munger's head rolling off his body. How can I expect good architectural plans from someone who's head could become a stale quiche at any moment? Mmmm, quiches¶ù But how did such an oddly shaped man defy augury and natural selection? Well, like all of nature's cruelest mistakes, there is a backstory. Munger's father, desperate to have a child of his own, shaped a vague humanoid out of Play-Doh and wished upon a shooting star that it could become a real boy. Unfortunately for all of us, it worked. Due to the peculiar nature of his conception, Munger has had to deal with people's remarks on the similarities between him and Pinocchio for all of his life. Munger dislikes the comparison however, pointing out that he and Pinocchio are nothing alike as he sold his conscience for five dollars in 1974. Although he legally is a real person, his abnormal conception along with his very advanced age has led to many cosmetics problems over the years, as we learned from Joan Campano, his recently fired makeup artist. I've never had to work so hard in my life just for them to remain so fucking ugly. One day when he was 97, his various facial features began to fall off of his face. It got so bad that we had to buy a Mr. Potato Head set and replace his nose and ears with Mr. Potato Head's. I'm glad I'm talking to you about this, my therapist said it would help.ù So as you complain about the inhumane design, protest on the corruption of the UC Board of Regents and feel unheard by an institution that's forcing you into crippling debt, just remember that Charles Munger has had to look like Charles Munger for 97 years and counting. It doesn't get worse than that.† † Rohan Solanki is in a silly, goofy mood. A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the Nov. 4, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

daily-stench,Mungry for More? Munger Hall Unveils New òOrtega II' Dining Commons,4-Nov-21,4:20 AM,['Varun iyer'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-04/102710/," UC SANTA BARBARAîIn a press release, Charles T. Munger, First of His Name, Sponsor of the Building, Grand Residence-Hall Dictator for All Eternity, proclaimed that He had listened carefully to student feedback and devised a solution for students' primary concerns. After intense scrutiny and review, His Holiness announced that He would give the people what they wanted: Ortega II.† When asked, He revealed that He had taken careful notice of how much the students just loved the Ortega Dining Commons î how fondly they spoke of it and how frequently they visited. Wanting only to be loved, His High Chieftainship just knew that He had to include such beauty and adoration in His grand new plan. When we asked how exactly one goes about building a sequel to the highly celebrated Ortega, His Grand Majesty described His plan: IN THE BEGINNING, THERE SHALL BE NOTHING. THENCE, I SHALL SPEAK INTO EXISTENCE A DINING HALL LIKE NO OTHER THAT HAS BEEN SEEN. IT SHALL BE DERIVED FROM THE SHEER BEAUTY AND CULINARY ACHIEVEMENT OF ORTEGA DINING COMMONS, AND DRAW SOME THEMES FROM THE KITCHEN IN THE SHINING,ù LIKE THE EMPHASIS ON CANNED FOODS AND PSYCHOSIS. AND OH YEAH, WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO DO A DEMONIC MURAL OF SOME GREEK TRAGEDY.ù Students are excited to eat at the new dining hall. One student, Jeanice (who only gave their first name out of fear of retaliation), trembled (with joy, surely) as they said that they were j-j-just th-thrilled to get the chance-the chance to relive Ortega all over again! I-I-I guess- I guess I'm just Mungry for More!ù they said with a smile-like motion on their face. His Voluptuous Forehead has already announced a much-anticipated grand opening menu for the dining commons in order to build up hype. Some highlights include the classic Ortega Slop (with a twist, or so we are told), Meat cube and Water (an innovative take on the classic gazpacho, and an excellent, thought-out plant-based option). Like all other students, this reporter awaits eagerly, mungry (munger-y?) for more. † Varun Iyer can't wait to try the new slop.

In order to appease the public and let students know of the benefits of living in the prison, Munger has reached out to Nexustentialism for an interview.† I don't know why people are complaining,ù Munger stated. Imagine seeing 4,500 people daily. I haven't seen anyone in weeks. The last person I talked to was Philip Zimbardo. Now there's a guy who knows how to handle college students!ù† In order to encourage students that the BoxÑ¢ is liveable and, in fact, a luxury, Munger has revealed a few key changes to our team at Nexustentialism. Originally we were going to bottle the oxygen and sell it. I got the idea from òThe Lorax.' That movie is my guide on how I do business. But after all the complaints, I thought that we'd throw the people a bone. Do students deserve oxygen? No. What have they done? But I'll satisfy their pathetic greed and give it to them.ù Munger even told us about an awesome feature of the rooms that students will need to use daily.† We've also decided to include a section of every room that is a dedicated òcrying corner.' We've even provided bottles for students to store their delicious, scrumptious tears in. We will be collecting them for ¶ research ¶ yes, um, research.ù† After a long period of silence from Munger, he continued.† Furthermore, we've added posters of these so-called òwindows' to physiologically trick the students into believing that they're there.ù When asked about the building's concerning shortage of windows, Munger asked us to define the term.  Windows? In all honesty, I don't know what those are.ù † Charli D'Mungrio has more training as an architect than Charlie Munger A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the Nov. 4, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

June!ù second-year Betty Garden said. I knew this day was coming, but I never expected it to hit this hard. There's just no way to prepare for the emotional onslaught she causes.ù Houses across Isla Vista pressed play on the album last night without sufficiently preparing a Taylor Swift Emergency Box, filled with tissues, junk food and pictures of puppies. I was doing fine for the most part,ù fourth-year Caroline Dare said. But then, when she says òI think it's strange that you think I'm funny òcause he never did,' on òBegin Again,' I lost it.ù Dare's housemates called 911, but since they were too backed up, she had to get the care she needed this morning. On her hospital stay, Dare said, Being a Swiftie is a difficult task, but I know God put me on this journey for a reason.ù As a result of the singer's threats, UCSB's Counseling and Psychological Services (C.A.P.S.) has seen an immediate increase in consultations. The most-cited reason for first-time visits was Taylor Swift,ù followed in second place by Tyalor Siwft.ù Due to the tear-stained intake forms, C.A.P.S. assumes these students were trying to spell Swift's name but were either shaking or crying too hard to do so. We are working overtime for students to get the mental help they need as a result of Swift's actions,ù Stacey Macey, director of C.A.P.S., told Nexustentialism. We're doubling the number of students we see weekly, going from one to two. When crises hit, we need to do everything we can.ù All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)ù was one of the most egregious and hostile attacks of the night. Complete with a new short film, the emotional break-up song tauts lyrics like And you call me up again / Just to break me like a promise / So casually cruel in the name of being honest / I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,ù prompting several depressive episodes and a tissue shortage in surrounding stores. Jake Gyllenhaal, the culprit who inspired the song, was not available for comment. His representative said he was coincidentally embarking on a year-long solitude retreat in the Himalayas where no one can find him. The Central Intelligence Agency held a briefing on Friday morning, addressing the steps they are taking following Swift's damages. Superstar Taylor Swift has been on our radar for a while,ù the director of the organization Brad Goddard said. Last year, we attempted to find her cabin that she's holed up in, releasing these threats to American security,ù referencing 2020's folkloreù and evermoreù albums. The result was unsuccessful. All her press is virtual, leaving a non-existent footprint. She's a master at this.ù† On the fact that workers everywhere were calling out of work, saying they were sick but really too heartsick to come in, he said, These are good American citizens she's pulling out of work. She can't keep getting away with this.ù A tear rolled down his cheek. She can't keep getting away with this.ù Sam Franzini is a Swiftie first, a Nexustentialism writer second, an Italian third and an American last.

I was just scrolling through Instagram when it caught my eye: A pastel-colored list of the signs and what would lie ahead of them that day,ù Bailey explained. After she swiped to the Sagittarius page, she started reading her daily plan, which was laid out for her. It said that a friend would make an appearance, I'd have some good news come my way and that I'd come to a shocking realization.ù† And the events that lead her to fling herself head-first into the star-gazing pseudoscience? First,ù Bailey said, counting on her fingers, I kept scrolling on Instagram. And you know what? I kept seeing my friends! Like, ALL over my feed. It was like they were posting for me or something.ù When asked if this day's feed full of acquaintances was any different from any other's, she countered, You don't get it. It SAID it would happen today. And it did.ù Afterwards, Bailey received her good news. My parents called and told me that our family cat, who was like a billion years old, just died.ù But, Bailey pressed, this was actually a blessing in disguise. Now that he's gone, we can get a little kitty that will be so much cuter! Since I basically predicted this happening, I told them I wanted to name her Amanda.ù Getting ready, she put on Megan Thee Stallion's 2020 album Good News.ù Then I was like, wow,ù Bailey said, eyes wide open in disbelief. The good news literally came to me, in music form. I thought, òThis is getting wild.'ù And then, the shocking realization. Horoscoscopy [sic] is my passion,ù Bailey explained, undoubtedly passionately. This day has gone exactly how @astroqueenie on Instagram had set out for me. It's like I'm traveling on a pre-ordained path through life.ù Bailey's plans after her truly not-coincidence-filled day include dropping out, immediately ignoring the concept of free will, and moving to Sedona, Arizona, to go look at some crystals. Under the powers that be, I'll know exactly how my days will be going.ù What's in the big picture for Bailey? Who knows where my newfound spiritual awakening will guide me. Maybe I'll write a book. Maybe I'll run for president. If @astroqueenie predicts it, anything is possible.ù Sam Franzini reluctantly believes in astrology because he is a neat-freak perfectionist Virgo.

daily-stench,Keg N Bottle Patron Revealed To Be Three Freshmen in a Trench Coat,2-Dec-21,4:20 AM,['Varun iyer'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-12-02/keg-n-bottle-patron-revealed-to-be-three-freshmen-in-a-trench-coat/,"Sierra Vakili // Daily Nexus Disclaimer: This is a real news story, and any similarity or relationship to fictional persons, monsters, fairies and deities living or dead is a mere coincidence. ISLA VISTA, CALIFORNIA î Late last Friday night, CSO Detective Etienne òEts' Craiyonne apprehended three of the most heinous criminals of the 2021-22 school year: McKayla Enany, Mikayla Strong and Macailagh Connor (also referred to as M&M&M). The three have been charged with: misdemeanor for improper use of a trench coat, federal felony fraud charges under RICO, and MIPs. Their crime? Purchasing alcohol, allegedly. The plan had all the makings of a Hollywood heist movie: A dedicated team, months of planning and a shadowy sponsor with deep pockets. The team: M&M&M were a carefully selected group of freshmen, each with unique talents. They share a triple in San Nicolas despite all requesting doubles, and they all slightly resent each other because of it. The plan: Three critical steps, each more complex than the last. The sponsor: Some guy from across the hall's grandfather had just died, so he had received a few thousand dollars for tuition.ù He promised to pay double the price for any purchased alcohol and bankrolled investments in training, disguise and snacks. The execution: According to Macailagh, the plan began without a hitch î as all plans do. In their disguise, they made their way from the park across the liquor store and hobbled across the street, thanks to the grace and braking abilities of two different oncoming cars. They entered K&B, grabbed a handle of peach New Am and a White Claw sampler pack and headed for checkout. The cashier, observing that the mysterious patron in the trench coat was clearly of age and privacy-mindful, decided not to ask for ID. So far, so good.† The mistake: The crucial moment came as the trio attempted to exit the store, where Mikayla (described in unprintable language by her fellow conspirators) tripped over the threshold, spilling the other two into the street. The capture: Our intrepid hero, Etienne Craiyonne, happened to be hard at work patrolling the area as they observed the impostors fall apart in the street. Craiyonne immediately observed fraud at play in the situation and informed the group that they were under arrest. After ensuring that the three were in CSO custody, Craiyonne offered them free water bottles and masks, which they politely refused. The fallout: All three were booked into the I.V. Foot Patrol's Foot Lock-up for the night before being turned over to federal law enforcement in the morning. They will be tried together on Nov. 31st in the District Court for California's 69th district. Meanwhile, I.V. liquor store owners are being told to keep an eye out for more hijinks, shenanigans and all-around capers perpetrated by the seemingly innocent fresh faces around campus. Varun Iyer is blissfully 21 now.

Finally,ù sophomore Capri Khorn let out with a sigh, propping her feet up atop her coffee table. Scorpio season is over!ù Indeed, the past month has been a rough one for Gauchos î midterms, Munger Hall and a shitbag ex's birthday seemed to plague us at every opportunity possible. At least it's over, right? Wrong. Just when Khorn thought the University might finally let her free from its jaws, it dawned on her. It's Sagittarius season. And Chancellor Yang ¶ is a Sagittarius.† But it's just a silly zodiac, right? Astrology doesn't actually mean anything, does it? Wrong and wrong again. After swirling rumors that the recent lightning storm was caused by Chancellor Yang's personal quest for immortality, Nexustentialism began investigating other mythical endeavors in which our beloved chancellor-turned-wizard may potentially be engaging this December.† 1. Building another, smaller Munger Hall atop the original Munger Hall and then another even smaller Munger Hall atop that one to make a Munger Hall Snowman What a festive kickoff to the holiday season! Amidst community outcry that, We like the beach,ù and Why the fuck is it snowing,ù we predict Yang's response to be along the lines of Fuck it! Fuck you! I want snow, so let there be snow! Go back to your fucking hotel, poors!ù Typical Sagittarius! The snowman will continue to smile, standing at the height of approximately 2.75 Storke Towers! Wow! Additionally, the nose of the snowman will be made of the world's largest carrot, measuring a whopping 20 feet! The $1.4 billion purchase will be made after big savings following the firing of 98.6% of teaching staff, reducing the student population to 13 and whittling down the number of majors to one (CCS computing). What a treat! 2. Start using they/them pronouns in an uneducated but good-willed attempt to be more inclusive† Diversity win? Upon noticing the minority of students at UCSB who use they/them pronouns to affirm their gender identity (or lack thereof), Chancellor Yang will strive to increase representation by changing their own pronouns to they/them. Impulsive and adventurous, Sagittarii often act before thinking, leading to some rash decisions; in this case, however, Chancellor Yang's team will beg and plead for him not to come outù in this way. Please, Chancellor!ù they will cry, Think of the children!ù But big H.T. will only respond, Silence, bigots!ù and will proceed to make history.† 3. Not reciprocating oral A classic Sagittarius move! All that pent-up fire sign energy has been brewing since Leo season in August, and it's going straight to the groin. Sagittarius season holds for Chancellor Yang an orgasm so powerful that it strikes them straight down into the throes of slumber, with not a crumb left for Dilling. Pitiful! Sadie Nym is walking in a winter Mungerland.†

Because we have literally nothing better to do, we decided to interview them. So, we're going to be coming in person! How do you feel? I'm really excited to come! I've always felt that, you know, coming face to face is one of the greatest pleasures of life. Coming in person is kind of like my love language. Although it is weird to be doing it after four weeks î usually it happens much quicker*. Also, my girlfriend's been away from I.V. because of this whole COVID thing or whatever, and I really can't wait to walk back home to my apartment after class and come in to her. Do you think the school has enough protection to come in person again? Honestly, I think it's really important to be able to come together without any kind of separation or barriers. Requirements to cover up really prevent us from achieving the kind of human connection that I value. Is there anything that concerns you about the process of coming in person? We did get thrust in person pretty abruptly î I just want to make sure that we get to stay in person for a while. Getting shoved in, and out, and in, and out of person would be ¶ pretty nice, now that I think about it. But anyway, we need to have clear expectations and open communication in order to finish strong. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we conclude the interview?

daily-stench,$580k Not Enough: Generous Students Start GoFundMe for Needy Yang,27-Jan-22,4:20 AM,['Sam Franzini'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-27/580k-not-enough-generous-students-start-gofundme-for-needy-yang/," Af ter the recent announcement that Chancellor Yang's salary would be raised by $125,000 to a measly $580,000 per year, students were left wondering if that's enough for Yang to get by. A group of students known as the Yang Welfare Collective (YWC) have banded together to start a GoFundMe for the impoverished chancellor, and donations are already flowing in. I mean, he works so hard coming up with solutions for us to have less money and less access to campus resources,ù local Good Samaritan Jessica Kandyl said while sobbing into her handkerchief. Starting the GoFundMe is the least I could do.ù As of right now, the pool has collected over $1.5 million in donations from students and their parents, making the GoFundMe the most popular page on the site. Yang's harrowing story not only brings to light how impossible it is to survive on a half-a-million-dollar salary in this climate. Recently, he purchased a vacation home in Hawaii to get away from the negativityù he's surrounded by at UCSB, brought on by all the annoying poorsies that keep nagging me,ù he said. His first choice for a tropical getaway î Fiji î was too expensive, so he instead opted for the paltry beaches of Hawaii. Not only that, but the destitute chancellor lamented that the first-class tickets he wanted to purchase had sold out too quickly. I decided to drop out of school next year and instead donate the money to someone who really needs it, Yang,ù second-year David Newman said. I had to break the news to my mom that I couldn't help her out this year, but she understood. òGo help out that amazing chancellor of yours,' she told me. òMy prosthetic legs can wait. That man needs help now.'ù The penniless chancellor is also paying for a personal home gym to be added to his current home since he's tired of not being able to access the UCSB Rec Cen before 11 a.m. However, he's having trouble accessing a full collection of weights, cardio equipment, a sauna, a steam room, a bowling alley and an ice skating rink due to issues with the global supply chain. On top of that, his butler accidentally supplemented the jacuzzi with chlorine instead of bromine, which would take weeks to clear out. Chlorine could make me itchy,ù Yang lamented. It's really a wonder how I wake up every day with hope in my heart that this might be the day everything turns around.ù As empaths, Yang's story of trials and tribulations is excruciatingly hard to hear, but we're thankful that the customers of UCSB support their chancellor after everything else he's done. Sam Franzini would like to know what the hell is going on. A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Jan. 27, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus. Comments are closed.

New Housing Plan Moves Students Into Offshore Oil Rig,27-Jan-22,4:20 AM,['Ben Red'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-27/suite-life-on-derrick-new-housing-plan-moves-students-into-offshore-oil-rig/," UCSB announced its new plan for students î most of whom formerly lived in hotels î to be moved to an offshore oil rig, citing fun and also moneyù as the main incentives. I can't wait for students to experience dorm-style living like no other!ù a UCSB representative said. We know students will be excited to live in a piece of California history while getting to know each other.ù Plans for the oil rig come from a year-long struggle to provide housing for students. Since Fall Quarter 2021, many students returning to I.V. have had difficulty finding housing. With houses and apartments all rented out and dorms filled to the brim, the university originally rented out hotel rooms for select students who could not find any housing. However, with the hotel program ending over winter break, the university is quickly exploring alternative options. Plans for the rig will feature 50 suite-style rooms, common areas, free petroleum, and a dining hall. Transportation will consist of a twice-a-day boat shuttle, and a damp towel will be provided to students who decide to make the swim. There is also a state-of-the-art recreation center where exercise is transformed into oil production and refining with the goal of increasing fitness through manual labor. School is all about learning,ù the representative said when asked if this plan may be controversial. We figure if students can go to and from class, they can also learn more about some of California's history in a one-of-a-kind opportunity.ù The current design of the oil rig dorm is planned to be completed in just six weeks, assuming that there will be no sort of objections from students or faculty. Ben Red has applied to live here next quarter. He is bringing a paddleboard and one extra towel. A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Jan. 27, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

daily-stench,Graduate Student Win! UC Grants COLA to Nine Very Specific Employees,31-Jan-22,4:20 AM,['Varun iyer'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-31/graduate-student-win-uc-grants-cola-to-nine-very-specific-employees/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Zoom, Calif. î †Just before the pandemic began in 2020, graduate students at UCSB and around the UC system were protesting the University for a Cost Of Living Adjustment (C.O.L.A.), a salary increase that would compensate students for skyrocketing housing costs. The pandemic soon dominated the news cycle and disrupted the students' struggle for fair wages. The University of California would never, ever leave its students behind or ignore their plight. The UC immediately responded to student demands by providing them with the generous offer of financial planning classes, including practical topics such as òhow to find a second job' and òhow to fit another roommate into your triple.' However, the University never responded to the students' primary concerns. Finally, this week, after two long years of protest, the University has finally accepted the demands of its graduate students! In a meeting last week, the Regents of the University of California approved a cost of living adjustment for its employees, so that they could afford the local housing that they deserved. The Chair gave a prepared statement during the meeting, which read: The protests and voices of the employees of the University of California speak to the great adversity and duress they have endured. The pandemic has only† exacerbated the deep crisis this university has faced in housing and meeting the basic needs of its employees. It is our moral prerogative to ensure that our employees are paid a living wage which is appropriate to the area that they serve. Ultimately, this is an issue of pay equity. We have an obligation to pay our employees well. For that reason, each chancellor of the UC system will be receiving a wage increase up to 28.4%, establishing a generous, living minimum wage of $552,000 per year. We hope that this resolution demonstrates UC's unwavering care and dedication to its employees' well being. Chancellor Yang, who received the highest raise of all, was thrilled by the news. I'm so glad that we worked so hard to make our voices heard at the highest levels of the system,ù he announced proudly. This victory just goes to show that the little guy has a chance, and that with enough organization and the courage to speak truth to power, you can do anything!ù Varun Iyer needs a byline, and a raise.

The once beloved and unproblematic mascot, perhaps best known for winning the prestigious Most Friendlyù award at the 2013 World Mascot Championship Luncheon, appears to now be facing a redesign, according to an email sent out Friday. Here at UCSB, we pride ourselves on making sure that our student body is as happy and pleased as they can be with the school,ù wrote Chancellor Yang. We hear the outcry about Ol√© being too sexy, and we will immediately set about making changes to his design.ù Though the meetings regarding the changes have so far been secretive, an anonymous student leaked a transcript of the meeting last weekend, claiming he found it on the floor of the HSSB bathroom.† According to the leak, the new and improved Ol√© will now wear a poncho and sombrero, helping cover his beautiful body and face while also remaining true to his Latinx origins. His name may also be changed, with officials saying they are likely to choose something from a big book of Mexican thingsù that they found on the fifth floor of the library. Further investigation has revealed this book to be Rachael Ray's Look + Cook: 100 Can't Miss Main Courses In Picturesù cookbook from 2010. The bestselling cookbook also features 125 all new recipes and is sure to delight any crowd, no matter how picky. And if you're looking for more, be sure to check out Rachael Ray's Comfort Food: 30-Minute Meals,ù Veggie Meals: 30-Minute Mealsù and 30-Minute Meals 2,ù available online at rachaelray.com. They're doing what????ù said the real Chancellor Yang, leaning out of what appeared to be a fresh-off-the-lot Bentley Continental GT V8 Convertible parked outside of Wildcat. Because he's too sexy??????? I mean, yeah, duh. That's the design. If anything, we should make him sexier. Back when I drew the new costume for Ol√©, he wouldn't have been caught dead in a shirt. Probably would've ripped through one, anyways, with those biceps I gave him. That's what the redesign should be. If I get back to my desk in March and see they took away that handsome jawline, I'm gonna flip my shit.ù Upon being informed that that was indeed one of the planned redesigns, Yang slammed his fist down on the dashboard, knocking his phone out of the car mount and between the seats. Fuck!ù exclaimed Yang, who proceeded to attempt to wedge his hand between the driver's seat and the center console to no avail. Yang then backed his seat up to try to reach underneath, accidentally crushing a to-go container of pasta left in the backseat and getting alfredo sauce all over the floor. Further attempts to interview Yang proved unsuccessful, most likely because he drove away and wasn't there anymore. Spaghetti Williams is stuck in a time portal and would like help as soon as possible.

You and the homes of students in Isla Vista have that in common! Many students have found themselves calling up their landlords, worried about the ever growing presence of mold in their cozy little homes and the potential effects it could have.

After talking to a couple different landlords around I.V., even more benefits brought by having a bit of mold have been identified. The mold? Who are you again? Oh, yeah it's, uh, since you kids love plants so much. It's like another one of those succulents or something,ù according to Vil Lin, a local landlord and fan of plants. So not only is this mold a friendly presence, it also brings in a fairy garden, cottagecore theme to your home! For the girls and the gays, this is an absolute win. Having mold will help decorate and add to the vibes of the room, not hurt anyone. While there have been reports of sickness in households that have mold, remember we are in a pandemic, and it couldn't possibly be the mold since the landlords so clearly said it's not a problem. Just calm down! There you have it Gauchos, there is nothing to fret over. Your mold is a friend, a super cool vibe and presents absolutely no threat to your home or your health. Landlords are now encouraging tenants with mold to first of all, relax and stop bothering them, and second, name their new friend!† Fart Tent thinks landlords should get a real job instead of exploiting students.

Looking like the remains of your toilet after a night of DP partying and Deja Vu eating, DLG's latest monstrosities have struck fear into the hearts of hundreds of students.† Upon entering the twilight zone, De La Guerra dining commons, you wonder how long your body can survive on slices of pizza and lettuce. You assume you'll find solace in the hall's two soda machines, but another cruelty awaits you. You scour the labels to search for a delicious soda to wash away the pain, but alas, UCSB is a Pepsi school and only offers sodas as bitter as the UCSB parents Facebook group. After minutes of staring at the same four meals, desperately hoping something edible will emerge from the darkness, you make your decision. Looking like something the Grinch would produce after ten cans of Trulys, your unidentifiable green meal looks less appetizing than a bed of nails. DLG's claim to fame is being mentioned in a Jack Johnson song about feet, which ironically is exactly what this meal is reported to have tasted like.† DLG, also known as UCSB's own personal glitch in the matrix, is the campus' most frequented dining hall, often leading to long lines and overcrowding.

Our journalists at Nexustentialism interviewed a wide variety of students to weigh in on whether Yang is a massive flop, or if he deserves some top! Well to be quite fair, he's caught a lot of heat since the initial backlash against Munger Hall; I'm surprised that he was able to make it out alive,ù said third-year philosophy major June Ferrera while thoughtfully twirling her pencil.

That man is built like a fucking Kardashian.ù Ferrera concluded that while Yang may be in his flop era, he and his gigantic badonkadonk are, indeed, lowkey serving. Even the staff are thirsty for a tall glass of Yang, and it's pretty fair to say that Yang is quenching our collective thirst with his unrivaled drip. At the last assembly meeting, Yang pulled up in an all-black Rick Owens ensemble paired with òthose Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks,' as Cardi B would describe them,ù one anonymous staff assembly member whispered to us, visibly sweating.† He had his Miu Miu shades on the whole time and would not stop adjusting his big black puffer jacket.

Say what you will about the guy but you can't deny that he's a beast,ù Matthews wiped a bit of spittle off the side of his mouth.

In an effort to save face after his now infamous pay raise, Chancellor Yang agrees to install adjustable boob and ball holders in every UCSB dorm shower.† I just can't hold my boobs as I shampoo my hair,ù said first-year student Uma Davis, UCSB should be ashamed. What the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm not an octopus.ù Students like Miss Davis have long demanded action from the administration to adopt more inclusive infrastructure to accommodate their lonely appendages. Trent Gainz, a third-year student and head of the Hold My Moundsù movement, expressed relief and elation over this momentous decision.

He knows he is one wrong step away from being thrown in the lagoon.ù Either way, students seem to doubt Yang's intentions and his ability to follow through with his promise.† But for some students, these are not the most pressing issues.

While most students accepted the logic of these rules thanks to yet another COVID variant, some of our school's Republicans had a bone to pick with the gender-neutral COVID tests being used at the Loma Pelona testing center.† This is outrageous. Yet another transgression from the social Left,ù said fourth-year spokesperson for UCSB Republicans, Kancelle Mi. According to Mi, the group believes that students should be required to use anatomically correct COVID tests instead of participating in a communist utopian fantasyù that distorts scientific reality.ù When asked to elaborate on how gender could affect a saliva test, Mi replied that gender is the same as sex, and men and women are different, with different sex bodies. Sex-speaking,ù Mi added, as an afterthought.† We reached out to the Biology Undergraduate Program here at UCSB for further insight into this loaded statement through email. Their reply was a simple plea asking us to fuck off.ù Though our school's vocal minority remains in discussion on which course of action to take in protest (a leaked source revealed that option attempt coupù is rising in popularity in the Google survey, alongside tweet angrilyù), most got the test administered before the due date like sheeple being led to slaughter,ù according to a third-year Republican who giddily insisted we nickname him Let's Go Brandon.† The truth is that far more men and women will be victimized using a gender-neutral COVID test than the number of nonbinary people who will feel good about it,ù continued Brandon.

When asked by our undercover Nexustentialism correspondent to describe a day in his life as a guy who is constantly surrounded by beautiful women, Carter said, I don't do much really. I just roll out of bed and mess with my hair a little bit, spend some time with myself and the squatter, then take around 20 minutes debating with my ensemble on what I should wear to best appeal to the women.ù This ensemble, composed of his roommates and some random guy living next door who he allows to shadow him, makes up his alternate population of bitches. These male bitches are those who he uses to accompany him on his daily quests to the Carrillo Dining Commons in order to balance out the throng of women who flock toward him at any given moment. Being a lady's man, the high that my roommates get from being associated with me is more of an ego boost than the one I get from being around so many women all the time,ù Carter said.

This Valentine's Day, I'm sure many of us are sad about not having a special someone to spend the day with. Not me though. But for the rest of you losers î don't worry! Our very own little Cupid, Chancellor Yang, is cooking up something amazing for anyone who has no game but still wants to enjoy Valentine's Day. This upcoming Monday, while many of us will be out and about on campus, Yang reported that he will be acting as a matchmaker. Sporting a diaper and Cupid's iconic bow and arrow, Yang intends to walk amongst us, looking for two kids he can totally ship together. With his amazing sense of smell, he can easily tell who's in desperate need of maybe a hug, or even having their hand held. Don't be alarmed if our little Cupid sniffs you this Monday! It's all a part of his process. Once he finally finds two scents that are fitting, he will drag the students next to one another and begin to break out into a little jig.† KISS! KISS! KISS!ù he'll chant, waiting for the two students to pucker up and make their V-day a memorable one.† After the students share a sweet and tender kiss, they'll immediately be wed, with Chancellor Cupid as the officiant. Should the students ever decide to get a divorce or nullify their marriage, Yang will cry, like, a lot. After the ceremony, Yang will skip along, sniffing out his next couple.† So, if you are feeling upset or disappointed about what you're missing this upcoming Valentine's Day, make sure you find your way to the matchmaker. Our beloved Cupid will surely make hearts swell this Feb. 14.

Your Valentine Got You a Bag of Milk,10-Feb-22,4:20 AM,['Casey Gallagher'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-10/cute-your-valentine-got-you-a-bag-of-milk/,"Casey Gallagher / Daily Nexus Ah yes, if it isn't the time of year for what is indisputably everyone's favorite holiday: Valentine's Day. I know you horny losers have been waiting all year to see what kind of clich√© and uninspired lace garment your partner gets you for your long night of disgustingly vanilla sex. However, what if I told you that your special one is pulling out all the stops and getting you none other than ¶ a bag of milk! A bag of milk?!ù This second-year has no fucking clue what's going on. My boyfriend was hyping up this gift for me for about three months straight, and man, was I excited. But I then came to discover that this man genuinely bought me a soggy-ass bag of milk. That's it¶and it was the best day of my life. I can't believe he actually got me something! AHHHH! *squeal*ù† Now you may be asking, what exactly is a bag of milk? For those of you who had to suffer through your elementary school years without the sweet, loving embrace of neopolitan heaven, a bag of milk is exactly what it sounds like. An inflated plastic square, plump with cow titty juice in either regular, chocolate or strawberry flavors. The bags operate by stabbing a tiny, red straw in the middle of the square as if injecting steroids into a bicep. It is glory, it is joy, it is nostalgia. The perfect gift, right? This first-year man had the opposite opinion about his boyfriend's generous gift. Is it supposed to be like an innuendo? There has to be more than this, right?ù Wrong ¶ That's it, baby! I mean¶I guess it's better than nothing,ù he complained. Yes it is better than nothing, it's far grander than nothing. It's a gift from God, a sight from heaven. So despite the negative reaction from this ungrateful leech, the men are surprisingly pulling out all the stops this year. But they're not the only ones in on this trend. One fourth-year woman exclaimed, Oh my goodness, my girlfriend could not have thought of a better gift! I always tell her I want mommy's milk, and she finally came through.ù Beautiful, just beautiful. At least this woman understands the privilege of receiving creamy, dripping glory.† Anyway, folks, if you're seeking the best way to please your partner this Valentine's Day, throw away all the roses, chocolates and lace, and come through with the moist, illustrious glory of a milk pouch. Get that bag, losers! † Casey Gallagher wishes she could relive the pure ecstasy of drinking a chocolate milk bag for the first time.

While the original plan contained no emergency exits of any kind, school officials were informed that this design was not up to code, leading Munger to design an innovative, new fire escape system that requires students to use a keypad on the fire escape door to type their UCSB NetID, perm number and password. They will then be emailed a 20-character-long sequence of numbers, letters and various symbols that must be typed into the keypad in order to access the escape route.

This time, they've set their sights on Black History Month. Despite backlash from literally everyone, white people nevertheless persist. Cries dissipated from the Black community, echoing can we have just one thing?ù to which White Man Supreme, Joe Biden himself, responded in a press release. It read: No <3ù ì Joe Biden † Now that white people have recolonized all 12 months, here are our top 5 ways that white people have been a little extra white this Black History Month. America! Sports! Go get that ball! What's whiter than throwing a few òdogs on the òcue and watching the big boys on the television toss around the pigskin? This Superbowl Sunday, Americans basked in the beautifully American tradition while forgetting about everything else, including that silly fella Colin Kaepernick from way back six years ago. Who needs him when you have The Star-Spangled Bannerù? 2. President's Day / George Washington's Birthday / Abraham Lincoln's Birthday Thank goodness for these guys! Where would we be without Big Georgie and Abey Lincs? These Professional White Guys have brought whiteness to a whole new level, claiming their own celebrations during Black History Month! How impressive! And who could forget about the other 43 white guys staking their white-man claim on February in the form of President's Day?  3. Picking the Shortest Month Possible Nexustentialism actually managed to finagle some exclusive audio content from Gerald Ford and his gooneys who formally instituted Black History Month way back in 1976! Ford was recorded to have said You're sure February is the shortest? There's not one with, like, 20 days?ù before agreeing to give February the title of Black History Month. History is neat, right? 4. The Abandonment of the BLM Highlight on an Instagram Profile As white people everywhere are posting their Galentine's Day pics on the ògram, they're sure to stumble across that pesky old Black Lives Matter story highlight. You know, the one they haven't posted on since June 2020 but are afraid of deleting out of fear of seeming racist. Call that an inclusivity win! 5. Joe Biden's Cat Adoption Slay pussy king! While Mr. White could be doing any number of things to help Black Americans î like decriminalizing marijuana usage, canceling student debt, abolishing the police, instituting reparations or addressing the inherent inequity between Black Americans and white Americans in the areas of education, healthcare, career opportunity, wealth, housing and pretty much everything else î you have to admit, Willow is so darn cute! † Dick H.

A representative from the entomology department, Ms. En D'Pointe, contacted the Nexus with this news after receiving an internal memo regarding celebrations throughout the month of February.† All those emails said that the department was celebrating diversity for Black History Moth. I assume they are talking about biodiversity,ù Ms. En D'Pointe said, excitedly. While the rest of UCSB is painfully aware that this discoveryù has to have been the result of some typo somewhere within the entomology department, no one within the university has the heart to let down those little insect scholars. They already have so little. I just think we should let them have this,ù third-year Jake Kay said. I mean they study bugs, they really don't have much, and they have their little hearts set on this.ù Other students, though, are opposed to letting these moth-based delusions continue on any further. Sidney Johnson, a concerned second-year, couldn't help but wonder what the fuck a Black History Moth would even be if it were discovered. Is the moth supposed to have some kind of expert knowledge of Black History, or is it just named that?ù asked Johnson. It just seems like they can't be that stupid to think that there would be celebrations and university-wide emails regarding a moth.ù You would think that might be true, but the entomology department still has a mixer on the books to celebrate those interested in the Black History Moth scheduled for this Friday. We here at the Nexus will be covering the event closely. † A Wiessass has nothing else to add.

However, she explicitly stated that she did not want to be a dictatorù and that the committee plans to incorporate fun, additional elements to break up the monotony of formal dress. We will be having dress up days to keep things spicy! Monocle Monday and Three-Piece Suit Thursday are already on the roster!ù Miss Hump also made sure to emphasize that if students do not follow the dress code, they will actively be denied dining hall access and all food until they stop dressing like poorzies.ù However, to slowly introduce this drastic change in policy, Suits, Stilettos and Slop decided to do a test run at Ortega before making it mandatory at all dining halls.† I wanted to pick up my food at Ortega, and they wouldn't let me,ù said second-year student Jillian Billian. Apparently it was Top Hat Tuesday? I can't even afford a top hat.ù She choked back her tears before further elaborating, I rounded the corner to Ortega, and I saw a line of Abraham Lincoln looking-motherfuckers and immediately knew something was wrong.ù Our Nexustentialism correspondent had to end the interview because Billian collapsed after uttering this statement, presumably from exhaustion and lack of nourishment.† This startling interview with Miss Billian is only one of many, raising dire questions about the accessibility of the new mandatory dress policy. Third-year James Day told Nexustentialism, I didn't want to starve, so I placed an express order for a monocle on Etsy for Monocle Monday. With the express shipping, I had to pay close to $200 dollars,ù she declared sullenly. I went through all this trouble and money, but when I showed up to Ortega on Monday with my monocle on my eye, they still denied me food because they declared it òwasn't swag enough' and that the òcolor was wrong.'ù Miss Day's experience highlights how this policy could target students barely able to afford such frivolous expenses and leave them without food.† This commentary by Billian and Day emphasizes how the policy disproportionately targets students without disposable income and draws damning conclusions about elitist Yang. Until further notice, the only thing being served at the dining halls will be looks.† † Migraine Mommy has rapidly and fearfully ordered a three-piece suit, a monocle and a bolo tie.

However, when confronted with this revelation,ù our team was left dumbfounded.† What did you think they were for?ù asked Assistant Editor Sierra Vakili with an air of bewilderment. Her question was met with a dread-filled silence until the ringleader of the group, fourth-year Harry Pitman, was brave enough to speak out, shouting, We thought they were for your ass!ù† Pandemonium quickly ensued in the Stench office, with people shouting, crying, screaming and throwing up. When it was finally subdued, the office looked like a biblical catastrophe had occurred. Trash cans were on fire, and everyone was missing their left sock. In the silent aftermath, Nexustentialism Editor J. Matteo Wharton was able to ask the question we were all thinking: How did this even happen?ù Every person in the office scratched their head and got to thinking, until one of the writers decided to put it up on the board, spelling out the key issue in block letters: Nasal. How could they have mixed up nasalù and decided to put the swab up their butts? Everyone pondered quietly, and we heard someone solemnly whisper, God, I feel bad for Loma Pelona.ù† All was quiet until Stench writer Kathleen Santacruz offered, Hey, it's five letters! What if this is like Wordle?ù to which everyone replied, Shut the fuck up.ù But after a second, they realized that she might have a point. We all got to work on the letters on the whiteboard and began to rearrange them: nasal, lanas, anals.† The answer was right before our eyes: Anal! With this, Vakili asked the group of students, Were you all high when you tried to take the test?ù Every students' eyes widened in tandem, and they all nodded their heads. No wonder the purpose of the swab was misunderstood; the weed had clouded every mind and caused nasal to scramble on the page. Classic stoner moment. The mystery was solved, and a cheer rang through the Stench office. It is said that Storke Tower even cried tears of joy.† From that day forward, Harry Pitman swore to never smoke before swabbing and made sure that this mistake was never repeated again. However, it is unsure if Loma Pelona will ever forgive him ¶ † Migraine Mommy will forever trust in the power of Wordle.† Comments are closed.

It's always a waste of time because you'll just end up getting what the person in front of you bought. Have you ever stared at the Blendersland map and wondered how they've built an empire in Santa Barbara? There are somehow six Blenders in Isla Vista, Goleta and Santa Barbara alone. Have you ever wondered what half the things on the menu even are? What the fuck is a Blue Orange? If you've ever wanted to taste some delicious bee pollen supplements, Blenders is your place. If you ever want a smoothie that doesn't have bananas in it, Blenders is not your place. Speaking of, have you ever even seen the supplements at Blenders?

Chancellor Yang Spends New Raise Adding 1,387,992 Sea-Monkeys to Lagoon",31-Mar-22,4:20 AM,['Kathleen Santacruz'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-31/rejoice-chancellor-yang-spends-new-raise-adding-1387992-sea-monkeys-to-lagoon/,"Kathleen Santacruz / Daily Nexus The UCSB campus community was recently given the news that our very own top dawg, Chancellor Yang, was given a raise. Despite temptations to spend the money on a golf cart so he and his wife could assert dominance by doing donuts on the Chemistry Lawn instead of strolling on paved walkways like mere mortals, he made the difficult decision to instead spend the money on his own personal campus beautification project. In a grand gesture toward not only the university but also its surrounding ecosystems, Chancellor Yang has decided to contribute what he can to science by adding approximately 1,387,992 Sea-Monkeys to the lagoon.† Yang claims that the addition of the Sea-Monkeys will make water research, once limited to those who studied in the field for years, accessible to anyone able to read the label on the back of the 172,405 boxes that the Sea-Monkeys came in. As for the existing microorganisms populating the lagoon, Yang is tired of being left out of the loop about what they're plotting in there î sources report it will be The Next Big Thingù in biological warfare. Yang believes the newest additions to the lagoon's quantum realm will be obedient and dedicated microbes, saying, These amusing little Sea-Monkeys are destined to provide the student body lots of joy,ù pausing before muttering, Joy which will hopefully distract their pea-sized brains from realizing nothing they're working toward actually matters so that I can continue making big moneys off of them.ù He then asked for some part of the interview to be struck from the record, but we forgot what it was. Yang has high hopes for his Sea-Monkeys. Based on their reputation, Yang believes that the microscopic creatures have the potential to develop their own underwater society like the funny underwater bunny-lizards in the Star Wars prequels. Yang is fully prepared to enter into discussions with the Sea-Monkeys once they develop a language so he can introduce capitalism to them and declare himself chancellor of their society, making him the most powerful UC chancellor to have ever lived.† † Kathleen Santacruz thinks that maybe colonized lagoon water will taste better than the liberated type.

When interviewed by Nexustentialism, fourth-year Elena Dover said, I was in love with this girl in my ANTH 2 section, but then I saw her without her mask on and she had this weird baby mouth. Like a really tiny little baby mouth.ù Dover then noticeably shivered and said, It was so wrong. So, so wrong.ù† Interestingly, some students are calling for the mask mandate to stay. I honestly think we should keep the mask mandate, if only to increase sexual tension and mystery. Like in The Batman!ù Masks made everyone so hot,ù said second-year film student Cali Ray. I realize that they are a different kind of mask but like come on, Zo√´ Kravitz and Robert Pattinson were so ridiculously fuckable because of them!ù She paused and took a deep breath before continuing, I think masks just do holy work. Even if we don't bring back surgical masks, we should mandate eye masks, like superhero masks.ù† Ray is determined to keep sex and intrigue alive at the university she loves. She started the organization Gotham Girliesù and is actively campaigning for eye masks in all UCSB spaces. I really hope that people identify with this cause. I really want to reinstate the sexual tension we all deserve here at UCSB.ù Ray will table in front of the Arbor to recruit members and then plans to take her mission to the chancellor.† If you hear òSomething in the Way' by Nirvana playing on loop, that is my table.

I am an econ major. Right now, you are nothing. We can change that, though. Before you lie two options î Option A: You continue your life as a beta specimen, always following orders from the people around you with nothing more than pennies in your bank account to show for it. Or, you can pick Option B: Read the rest of this article to find out the secrets of the blockchain. So, you're still reading, huh? *smirks* Good, you're a clever one. The blockchain is a mysterious beast. Only a small population of the general public can even hope to understand its many intricacies. Thankfully for you, I can simplify it with an analogy: Imagine baby sea turtles, trying to make their way back home. The turtles are the block, the sand is the chain and the seagulls that want to eat the turtles are filthy hackers. But fear not turtles, for the open sea of crypto welcomes you with open arms! Hopefully, that analogy cleared up the general picture. If not, think of this instead.

These rankings have shocked and angered haters of our brilliant institution, mainly those who go to Berkeley or UCLA. Why are we mentioned in the same breath as them?ù They may secretly fume. They're not the ones that have nine libraries or an acceptance rate under 15%!ù We at Nexustentialism pondered the intricacies of our university that rocketed our rankings since 2016. Could it be our extremely selective graduate-school prep college, the College of Creative Studies? Could it be our nationally renowned graduate physics program that is in the same league as Columbia and UChicago? Could it be our heavy involvement in environmentalism and sustainability through the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management? Nah, fuck that. You may be thinking, Wow! I didn't realize that U.S. News took our combined dye record and percentage of Certified Hotties into consideration!ù Your surprise is understandable, but unwarranted. We may be national leaders in scientific research and a part of the prestigious University of California system, but we are ranked by one thing, and one thing only: our pure animal magnetism. According to college rankings across the nation, we at UCSB are blessed with the unique ability to break necks and serve face. And that's not even considering our inordinately large population of professional keggers and fuckin' ballers.† We interviewed Anna McLovin, a seasoned U.S. News analyst, about her perspective regarding our school's prestige. Yeah, we actually use a very private and rigorous system to evaluate the rankings of each university when publishing our yearly rankings, so forgive me for being conservative with the information I divulge,ù McLovin sighed loudly while admiring her nails.† But I will say that you guys definitely have, like, that specific vibe that we're looking for.ù When pressed about what vibeù she is referring to, McLovin scoffed, I can't describe the vibe.

Elections Board, which anticipates a groundbreaking 25 votes in upcoming elections. It seems like all the students who can't vote in-state or in federal elections anymore are finally turning towards local issues,ù President Yuval Cohen reported. It's really heartwarming to see this kind of turnout.ù It remains to be seen whether CALPIRG will take the hint and stop swarming students with forms.

Greetings from FIJI!!!!! Well, I'll probably only be getting to the airport by the time you read this î depending on how late you sleep in, LOL î but close enough!! SO excited for this little spring break getaway; I needed this so bad!! I mean, I'm done with all of my major classes, and I just finished taking those two courses I picked because they were cute, but still! Wish you could come, girl! I'd fit you in my suitcase if I could! I mean, it's big enough, but TSA would probably arrest me!!!! Speaking of my suitcase, UGH. Sorry for the absolute NIGHTMARE of a morning I gave you while trying to leave. I got this new luggage set and had it custom fitted with a speaker so that I'd be able to tell which was mine when it came off the baggage claim place, but I didn't know how LOUD it'd be!!! So if you heard the phrase THIS IS SHANNON MICK'S SUITCASEù over and over, I'm so sorry!!! I just couldn't get the damn thing to turn off! I tried hitting all the buttons, but I kept accidentally turning on and off the built-in fan, USB port and minifridge compartment in the bag î clumsy me!!! And on top of that, our overhead light kept reflecting on the jewels I had the suitcase decorated with and it kept bouncing into your eyes î SO SORRY again. I don't think you woke up, though, which, PHEW! I'm glad you're such a heavy sleeper and a late one too! I'm planning to leave the house by 7:40 a.m., at which point, on a normal morning, I'd probably be back from the gym, blending up my green juice in the nutribullet î that just reminded me, I HAVE to get better at putting that thing in the dishwasher!!! One more thing to add to the New Year's Resolution list!!!!!!!! But thankfully you sleep so soundly! Ugh, but that's just me, always go go go, you know how it is. I wish I could live your life for a day, always so relaxed, never in a hurry to get anywhere!! (Although I don't think I could go a day without at least SOME form of exercise î I just go crazy when I'm cooped up all day!!! LOL!!!!)† When I was leaving, I was like, Aww!

So IDK what you were getting a lot of beauty sleep for î not sure what time you went to bed as I was out like a light at 9:30 p.m. ¶ That sleepytime tea is a miracle worker!!! But I hope it goes well!!! Oh, oh, you won't believe this. Guess where my mom announced we'll be going for spring break î Cabo. FUCKING Cabo. I can't believe it!!!! It's like we're just throwing our money at places instead of actually thinking about what will be fun. And on top of that, Cabo is my old high school friend, Gracie Michelle's, thing, and if I go there for break and post about it I'll look like a total fucking poser! I can't just rip off her spot!! But of course my mom said the tickets were non-refundable. To make it up to me, she bought another first-class ticket for my bestie Rachel to come along with and hired a professional photographer for my Insta pics, but honestly, what's the point? As soon as I post a picture with the location tagged as Cabo, no matter how cute I look with one of my new bathing suits I bought for the trip, no matter my professionally calculated hip-to-waist ratio, it won't matter. Once those Northcrest High girls see the post, they'll just think of me as Gracie Michelle's little minion, following her across the globe. And after our parents coincidentally took us both to Paris for our graduation present, I CAN'T have that happen again. (If only I worked hard enough to get above a 2.0 GPA î then they would have taken me to Japan!!!! UGH!!!!) Seriously, those Northcrest High girls are RUTHLESS.

AWWW!!!! Adorable!!!!!!!

Send me so many pics of your little dogs!!!! Tell your mom I said hello and I hope her wound is healing well!!! Seriously, I cannot BELIEVE Disney barely gave you any money for your trouble. I mean, if a rollercoaster stopped in the middle of the loop-de-loop and dropped me 75 feet on my head î Well, we go to a different amusement park, so it'd be more like 300 feet î I'd get a lawyer immediately!!! If you need one, let me know. My dad just sits around all day, looking for something to do!!!! He can only explore the house so many times!!! I might not be able to receive the pics you send î my mom booked a cruise around the South Pacific (which, I mean, tacky, right?) and on the website it said they don't have the best Wi-Fi (Of course! If you have a chocolate fountain that runs 24/7, I guess SOME sacrifices have to be made.) But send 'em anyway!!!

daily-stench,Rejoice! UCSB To Lower Tuition,1-Apr-22,4:20 AM,['Sam Franzini'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-01/rejoice-ucsb-to-lower-tuition/,"Sierra Vakili / Daily Nexus In a move of unparalleled grace, kindness and empathy, Chancellor Henry T. Yang has decided to lower UCSB's annual tuition. Out-of-state students will now pay just $42,000 a year (down from $44,160) and in-state students will pay $12,000 (down from $14,000). Yang explained his decision to do so in a recent press conference. I felt it was necessary, desired and the downright moral thing to do,ù he said while clutching his chest. These kids have worked so hard over the pandemic, completing their studies online with absolutely no cheating on closed-note exams. This is the least I could do.ù Second-year Lydia Johnson was pleased with the change. I'm so glad Yang implemented this change. What with his handling of in-person masking, the housing crisis and the recent kidnappings, it really shows his commitment to tackling problems, albeit one at a time,ù she said. During the interview, Johnson kept jumping up and down and screaming, Yippee!!!!!!ù† Yang is hoping that the recent change will have a positive impact on the campus's community, saying, I figured you students need the extra pocket change after the hard year we had. Two thousand bucks can get you, what? A house?ù According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, 93% of students plan to use Yang's tuition drop as spending money for alcohol and Adderall. Not wanting to stray too far from their precious chancellor's advice, though, some students are using their extra $2,000 for half of next month's rent. A parade commemorating The Great Tuition Lowering of 2022 and Yang's legacy and life will march through the Arbor on Friday, April 1. There will be floats of Yang and Michael Drake's heads, and popcorn and cotton candy selling for only $12.50. Extravaganza Warm Up rapper Flo Milli will fly in two days early to perform at the event. Krista Silver, the organizer of the event, is hoping it will bring publicity to Yang's achievements. Before he lowered tuition on this great day, we thought he was a lazy, asshole loser who couldn't care less how his students were feeling. But now?ù Here, Silver gazed wistfully into the distance and tears welled back up in her eyes. He's alright. He really does care about us.ù Several students have decided to pool their extra $2,000 into a Yang Appreciation Pool. He'll be presented with the check î the donation pile of which currently sits at $148,000 î at the parade, where he'll don a crown, scepter and sash displaying Best Chancellor Ever.ù He will then be carried into Isla Vista, where the grateful and simple townsfolk will throw roses, cash or other precious items at Yang, Savior of Economic Prosperity, Mental Health and Champion of All Things Good and Fair in the University of California System. One can only hope to possess half of the generosity that Yang has displayed with this decision. † Sam Franzini knows poking fun at Yang is a cheap shot, but it's not like it's unwarranted.

daily-stench,6 Ways Chancellor Yang is Pushin P,4-Apr-22,4:20 PM,['Some Bitch'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-04/6-ways-chancellor-yang-is-pushin-p/,"Sierra Vakili / Daily Nexus Pushin Pù, a hit song by Gunna and Future featuring Young Thug, has been topping music charts and dominating social media. However, some people have reported confusion about the meaning of pushin P.ù According to Genius, the phrase refers to keeping it player,ù or being true to self. To further explain this concept, look no further than our very own Chancellor Yang. Here are six ways that Yang is truly pushin P.† † 1. Lesbians are turning yesbian† One of the most perplexing lyrics in the song is she's not a lesbian, for P, she turn pesbian.ù Allegedly, girls who typically identify as lesbians turn into heterosexuals around Future (who is also known as Pluto, or P). A new study by the UCSB psychology department reveals that 69% of undergraduate lesbians would make an exception for Yang, and 42% agreed that they wanted his Chancellorussy.ù † 2. Yang's pockets are deep According to the song, having deep pockets is also pushin P. Yang just received a 28.4% salary increase from $451,362 to $579,750 a year. To quote Gunna, Yang is pushing this P with paper.ù † 3. Yang is powerful The lyric, I rock these presidents,ù suggests that presidents may be pushin P. Similarly to presidents, who hold power over a nation, Yang holds power over UCSB. † 4. Yang could get a private suite Due to his wealth, Yang could definitely afford a private suite, which is also referenced in the lyrics. † 5. Yang is too rich to text Later in the song, Young Thug states that he is too rich to text,ù and that his shawty will typically forward it. If you look in your umail inbox, you can see that messages from Yang are sent out by the Office of the Chancellor, where his shawty is undoubtedly located. † 6. Yang is loyal In a tweet, Gunna stated that being loyal is definitely P.ù Yang has a wife named Dilling Yang with whom he has been known to take daily walks. Loyal king! † Yang keeps it player by being extremely sexy, rich and powerful. With such a wonderful example right here at UCSB, it is easy to understand the true meaning of pushin P.† † Some Bitch hopes Sissy Sheridan reads this article.

Will Smith Oscars Slap Actually Awareness Stunt for Alopecia,5-Apr-22,4:20 PM,['Ben Red'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-05/sacrifice-revealed-will-smith-oscars-slap-actually-awareness-stunt-for-alopecia/,"Valerie Fu / Daily Nexus In a shocking revelation from sources close to Will Smith, the slap followed by the explicit statement was a moment of spontaneous advocacy on behalf of Will Smith to raise awareness for alopecia. He was just acting on the spur of the moment,ù our anonymous source said. He knew it would get him in trouble, but, at the same time, he had the opportunity to let the world know about alopecia. He doesn't want people to know this secret, but I can't take it seeing him suffer like this.ù† As for Will Smith's choice of words following the slap, our source had to say this, He's a professional actor, he's been doing it his whole life, so he knows what to say to have the greatest impact.ù We asked our source why Will Smith decided to make the altercation about his wife instead of directly bringing up alopecia, If he had made it about alopecia, then people wouldn't want to look it up as much. The key is misdirection. This way, people don't even realize how they are being played. Sure, Will Smith is suffering some backlash from this decision, but he had to play the bad guy for this to work. He decided to make the honorable choice and go down in his greatest acting performance yet: He defended his wife and got the word out on her disease.ù I reached out to the Academy for their response, what they had to say was, Of course it was a spontaneous stunt. It was so spontaneous that we even thought it was real, but moments after we got a text from Jada Smith explaining the situation. So, we decided not to bring the police in and ruin the moment.ù When asked what their response would have been had this been a real assault, Of course we would have arrested him! We're the Academy, not spineless monsters that are only here for money and care about our image only as much as it suits us. We want to do good when we have the chance.ù At this point, we can only hope and pray that the truth has been revealed in time to free Will Smith from the shackles of his own selflessness, but we shall see. † Ben Red is learning more about alopecia by the day thanks to Will Smith's sacrifice.

One of UCSB's most loathed rites of passage: the yearly victimization of a new generation of UCSB students by CALPIRG recruiters. Traumatized and hesitant to walk around campus, new students now live in fear of being indoctrinated into a pyramid scheme under the facade of an environmentalist group.† Being a freshman, I am a little green î pun intended î on the matter, so I walked around campus to talk with more seasoned CALPIRG harassment veterans.† They're trying to like gaslight me into saving the environment, which isn't very cash money of them you know?ù said Saraa Nara, a fourth year who is lowkey tiredù of CALPIRG's bullshit.

I am straight up and downright debilitated from trying to escape that damn turtle.ù On my way to the Arbor, the inevitable inevitably occurred: Tizzy found me. Looming in the skies like a second Storke Tower, the sacrilegious turtle began approaching me at an alarming cadence. I knew then and there that running was futile: Tizzy had a quota to make, and I was a metaphorical hare in a tortoise's race to manifest a pro-environment campus.† As Tizzy berates me with environmental propaganda, it's all I can do to beg CALPIRG to stop perceiving students as approachable individuals with fresh-out-of-the-oven fucks to give.† † H.L.

After patiently staking out the chair and keeping one eyeball peeled in its direction at all times, Gahm Mate at last settled into the warm, dark matter of the inside of the egg chair and resumed his place in his little science book, expecting to maybe finish his reading in time for his nineteenth consecutive midterm whilst three weeks into the quarter. Five hours later, however, Mate was found by library workers covered in a strange plasma, surrounded by broken pieces of egg chair shell and a rancid stench. Dazed and confused, Mate spoke only in tongues for 22 minutes until he was doused with a gallon of whole milk someone bought from 7-Eleven. Brains everywhere were scrambled. Only then did the question arise î what the fuck hatches out of an egg chair? On the scene of The Hatching, bystanders have provided Nexustentialism reporters with mixed descriptions of the Chair-born: In the misty fog of the early morning, they saw a 12-foot-tall creature that walked on its hind legs, resembling an ostrich capable of flight with the confidence of a male peacock and exuding an aura of Keanu Reeves. The Chair-born then let out a roar similar to that of a mountain goat and galloped into the hills. No one was close enough to get any kind of general vibe from the Chair-born, which has led to many unanswered questions for scientists and groupies alike.† Researchers everywhere are flabbergasted about The Hatching. Ongoing theories include that the heat of the combined political and international climates created perfect conditions for fermentation of the egg chair, which led to something having to crack. For students who don't quite know what to do with this unprecedented event, Campus Resources now includes organized worship ranging from Wattpad writers to Satanic worshippers who have taken an interest in the Chair-born and see its presence as more of a deviled egg. New egg chair classes are also being taught in both research science and religious studies departments. † Kathleen Santacruz is gonna lay off eggs for a while.

Are you happy? Sorry, happy enough? Who are you sitting with? Consider these questions with great thought, because they could be the very thing that determines whether or not you find yourself as the next poster child of UCSB. With tour groups running amuck, you need to be prepared to seize the moment and demonstrate just what we're all about here at UCSB. As I'm sure you know, UCSB is a very diverse institution. However, when it comes time to showcase true diversity to the little tour groups here at UCSB, some friend groups just aren't sure how to do it. So, if you're not sure about what to do when you find yourself out with your most diverse group of friends, look no further! We've got you covered! First, we need to talk who's there and what you are wearing. Make sure that more than one style, race and gender are represented, and that they showcase just who you are. Black girl wearing a labcoat: woman in S.T.E.M., empowered, smart, girlboss. Racially ambiguous person with a bit of a preppy look: smart, confident and a little shy everywhere but the classroom. Asian guy with a cool jacket: cool, charming, definitely your class crush. White guy with balls: for sports, duh. Mexican person with a skirt on: their legs are itchy from the grass, cool sense of style, you wish you were them. Make sure you have them all, or at least a variation of this group. Next, make sure you have the props down. Your outfits only tell part of the story; the props finish them. A book, a copy of Nexustentialism, cool headphones or a notebook would do the trick. There has to be a storyline for the people to follow î the props will make sure people know what you're doing on the lawn. Lastly, pose! Flip your hair back as you laugh and look effortlessly beautiful, read the newspaper, smoke the joint, jam out to your cool music î whatever it is, as long as it's clear you are having fun and comfortable with the friends surrounding you. Make sure these poses don't put too much center on one person, either î everything has to be as even as possible.† Now all there's left to do is wait for the wide eyed tour groups to approach and forever remember you as the perfect example of multiculturalism here at UCSB! You know what they say: fake it till you make it! † Fart Tent wishes there was more diversity at UCSB.

daily-stench,God Cancelled,30-Apr-22,4:20 AM,['Roberto Gutierrez'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-30/god-cancelled/,"Kathleen Santacruz / Daily Nexus This past weekend marked a rare trifecta in religious observance, as Ramadan, Passover and Easter all took place on the same weekend! This sudden blow to the usual depravity of Isla Vista has left many students, heretics and downright naughty people wondering the same thing: Isn't it time we canceled God?
 We as a society have run out of people to cancel,ù avid twitter user @stopaskingforfeetpics informed us. We've started to just make shit up to try to cancel people, like when my boy started that shit about A$AP Rocky. We scoured the internet for targets, going so far as to look past the first page of Google. The situation was so dire we almost went with canceling Joe Gaucho, but then one of us suggested we go after the almighty Father himself. Imagine the clout we can get from that!ù Isla Vista has separated into multiple factions in order to handle canceling all three parts of God: The Father will be slandered by Twinks of Santa Barbara as they are experts in misbehaving with daddy, The Son will be ridiculed by fraternity bros as they specialize in hurling obscenities at minorities and the Holy Spirit will be captured by the religious studies majors, who weren't originally part of the plan but just wanted something to do. One is left to wonder, however, if God truly deserves to be canceled. He sure¶[Belch noise]¶he sure fuckin does!ù said ex-prophet-turned-functional alcoholic Chris T. Sejus, while demolishing his third bag of bloodù which smelled an awful lot like wine. That son of a BITCH doesn't even know, doesn't even THINK about what he does ¶ you ever seen a blobfish? Look that shit up! What the hell even is that!ù He went on to speak complete gibberish to our field reporter for about 30 minutes, repeatedly offering bread and fish that didn't seem to run out. Perhaps it is time for the man upstairs to face the social consequences of his actions. A quick look at any story in the old testament would back this sentiment up. It does leave one wondering, however. If UC Santa Barbara manages to cancel God, what future lies before us? Worse yet, what might happen¶if we fail? † Roberto Gutierrez is not looking forward to explaining this in confession.

Here is her vulnerable and shocking story. At first I swiped right because he looked good enough to eat! Curly brown hair, chocolate-colored eyes and a bright smile. We were talking for a while on the app and he seemed really sweet so we finally agreed to meet up at Woodstock's. When I got to Woodstock's I saw him sitting at one of the booths in the back. I waved at him but he didn't wave back. He just kept staring straight ahead and didn't move a muscle. I figured he was just nervous. But when I got to the booth, he still didn't move and I knew something was wrong.† I was like, òTristan? Hello?' and he just stared straight ahead with his chocolate brown eyes. And then all of a sudden, this bitch in a cupcake apron with a knife came out of nowhere and sliced him down the middle. I almost fainted, but then Skittles spilled out of him and his chest fell away to reveal he was actually cake. Yeah, he was cake.† Then all of a sudden these camera people came out of nowhere, and the chick with the knife announced to me that her name was Trixie, and that I was on a reality TV show called Tinder Treats.ù Apparently it's this whole thing where they catfish people on Tinder with a picture of a realistic human cake on the profile, but when you show up they surprise you by revealing it's not a person. The inspiration was supposed to be from those òis it cake?' Instagram videos where they cut a sneaker or a banana and its cake, except this time it's a person.† I don't know who the fuck thought this was a cute idea, but I'm still in therapy. I have serious trust issues now. And the worst part is, the cake didn't even taste good. It wasn't even scrumptious!! It was that really mediocre Ralphs cake. If you are going to give me lasting trauma, it should've at least been Gelson's-level patisserie. I was sobbing but Trixie made me eat through my tears. She thought it would make me feel better. But no. The frosting was the consistency of cement, and I think my teeth started writing their wills due to the 100% sugar content. The cake offered no respite either. It had the consistency of a 99 cent store dish sponge. My body started to tremble and my stomach churned upon the second bite. I think my system recognized it as the most mid thing I've ever eaten and immediately started to reject it.ù†† Bottom line, I would just like to say a big fuck youù to Trixie at Tinder Treats.

Esteemed Nexustentialism reporter Roberto Gutierrez discussed this in his article BREAKING: God Canceled,ù but he failed to anticipate the possible ramifications of this cancellation î that being the heavenly father sending 10 plagues into Isla Vista. No matter how many times we sang, òOur God is an awesome God,' the plagues just kept on coming,ù explained a tearful local youth group leader who was persuaded into supporting the cancellation by the promises of premarital sex and a lesbian lifestyle.ù The first plague ravaged Isla Vista on Monday, April 18, and no one was remotely prepared for it except for perhaps our very own Chancellor Henry T. Yang. It was a plague of 1000 twinks. This was in response to the Isla Vista general public misbehaving with daddyù (God's words, not our own). Before I knew what was happening, I was tackled by a group of skinny white boys and forced into a homemade muscle tank,ù a frightened second year reported. This was followed by an outbreak of leprosy the next day. The leprosy outbreak isn't affecting my day-to-day life so much,ù a local computer science major explained. Leprosy luckily doesn't affect green badge status, so I've been able to attend all of my classes!ù Despite a relatively relaxed reaction to leprosy, there was complete outrage in the wake of the third plague: a weed drought. I can't believe God took all of our weed on 4/20,ù said Kyle ì some guy we found ì as he choked back tears.† The following days were no better as God sent widespread erectile dysfunction on Thursday, drained the lagoon on Friday, cancelled the First Amendment on Saturday and sent swarms of blobfish to the coast on Sunday after locals called them super fucking mid.ù In the aftermath of these atrocities, there was widespread panic and rage. Fuck monotheism,ù said a local frat boy who went on to explain the plethora of godly men in his life, including Joe Rogan and Kanye West. That doctrine is a load of BS. I would kiss the feet of Mr. Rogan or Mr. West any day, but not the feet of this mf, he is overly salty. Do you know how many times Kanye West has been canceled? He didn't take our weed.ù† Kyle then heard that God had sent his Monday plague î any alcohol a frat brother touched turned into water. I hate the taste of water,ù Kyle said, once again holding back tears as his fraternity sweethearts pinned him down and forced water through his chapped and dehydrated lips. This shit is so fucking rank,ù he mustered as tears began to comingle with the water droplets dribbling down his chin.† On the second-to-last day, God took away catching a fat domeù (his words, not ours). Hundreds of students were seen relentlessly hitting their vapes, but domes were outlawed, and absolutely none were to be caught. Finally, on April 27, God ended his tyranny of plagues with a widespread darkness over the land. It was heartbreaking,ù a group of local girls exclaimed, it was 80 degrees out, but there was a UV index of 0. We were unable to tan or dayge. I was forced to cross stitch God a quilt by candlelight.ù† In the wake of God's maniacal handiwork, the Isla Vista community has come together and decided to sacrifice one A.S. senator *as a student* to God annually in order to keep the peace. It seems that this will be a successful way to ensure that a slew of plagues are never sent to this quaint little beach town again!†† † Theresa Harris-Olson Taylor needs a hearty bowl of soup.

Is it a facial orifice? Call it a thrussy! Is it a backdoor delight? Call it a bussy! Is it something so innocuous that it couldn't possibly be corrupted? Phan Eeguy begs to differ! No matter who he comes across, Eeguy is bound to elicit a chortle when he inevitably turns even the most mundane object into a sopping hole.† We at Nexustentialism were itching to ask how Eeguy manages being the funniest man in Isla Vista. We had the pleasure of sitting down with him after we hunted him down through a crowd of screaming fans right after an open mic night at Woodstock's. Ah, it's really not that hard. I'm just a guy, looking at the world, wondering why there aren't more ways to relentlessly objectify everything he comes across,ù Eeguy leans back in his chair and sips his coffee thoughtfully. Looking down at his half-caff oat milk latte, he smirks. Not the straw-ussy!ù He exclaims, causing all of us to slap our knees and guffaw uncontrollably.† After the laughter died down, Eeguy stood up and paced around the room. As you may know, I've been asked so many times about my sources of comedic inspiration, and I never really know how to respond. How do I articulate that when the only person I really draw inspiration from is ¶ myself. Joan Rivers, Kevin Hart, Jerry Seinfeld; fuck those guys, you know what I mean? -Ussy is the Tesla of comedy. So I guess that makes me Elon Musk.ù Our reporters also sat down with one of Eeguy's many groupies, Amelie Ratajkowski. When asked about Eeguy's comedic endeavors, Ratajkowski said, Every girl says that they want a funny guy, and Phan is the goofiest guy around! Ever since I heard him call an electrical outlet a òcharge-ussy'¶ù Ratajkowski paused and sighed in wonder, Heart? Stolen. Panties? Soaked. Hotel? Trivago.ù Wow, what a stand-up guy! We at Nexustentialism were provided with a significant amount of food for thought. Can anything be an -ussy? Red Solo cups, the Secretary of State, my Macbook Air, a desk lamp, a Subway footlong ì the possibilities are endless! With newly opened minds and a can-do attitude, we trodded onward with a renewed sense of vigor, on a quest to terrorize every hole-adjacent noun with its inevitable -ussification. † Miss Informed has at least nine -ussies and counting!

The Co-op combines the thrill of grocery shopping with the risk of bankruptcy; it's like a rollercoaster that makes you want to go back for seconds. It's the only store in America where the organic chocolate section is bigger than the one for bread, and let's not forget about the comprehensive beverage fridges where, last minute, you can pick up a treat because you deserve it.ù And it's all conveniently located in the heart of Isla Vista, where, just nearby, you can even pick up a dusty history book someone was desperate to get rid of from the Little Lending Library.† But there's just one glaring problem. As much as I love seeing its homeopathic cures and shampoos that the all-natural population will go crazy for, the probiotics that will cause you to take out a loan or the random books and calendars on display, there is absolutely zero useful toothpaste available in the shop. Dr. Bronner's has enough words on the packaging to constitute a novel, but will any leave me with a feeling of cleanliness as I drift off to sleep? Nope! JƒS√ñN and Aurom√®re have enough random markings in their names to put Los Angeles' brunch shops out of business, but the feeling that I just rubbed my teeth against a tree is enough to forgo the chicness of purchasing $7 toothpaste. Crest, Colgate, Sensodyne î† I'll take anything, even if only 8/10 doctors recommend it! From the smattering of signs outside that makes customers go, Okay, sure!ù to the sitting area that I've only seen moms at, their business is clearly a thought-out one. I mean, really. Though it seems like half of Isla Vista's population thinks shoes are optional, I hope that the Co-op doesn't take that as a sign that everyone's hygiene isn't a priority. All I'm asking is for them to forgo improving the bagel station (that only ever has one bagel) and introduce the citizens of Isla Vista to a toothpaste brand whose CEO might not pay their taxes. † Sam Franzini believes it's possible to support sustainability and toothpaste all at once.

Cursed forever by our gal pal Platform Holly and her fun little extractions of natural resources, the revenge of the big-green-nature gods is upon us in the form of a constant state of wind advisory. After sending a correspondent into the sky via the slingshot we rented from a carnival company, we have received input from the four winds and their thoughts on their massive blowings and whooshes bombarding our little self-involved Isla Vistans. Our correspondent found the North Wind high up in the swirly wind storm, scowling down at him. You mortals have been very bad, and you deserve to be punished,ù the North Wind declared. How shall we continue to assert our dominance as the gods of wind without the submission of the meek beings bound to the earth who are destined to be controlled?ù The South Wind, hearing this, looked over and whooshed straight toward our correspondent to give him a piece of their mind.

Our correspondent flinched as the wind's spit landed on his face, his body quivering below the two gods. Soon enough, the West Wind wanted to have a say in what was going on, stating, I think what, like, we're really here to do is somehow, like, blow all of the oil out of the ocean. Y'know?ù Our correspondent nodded in agreement. The other winds rolled their eye holes. The East Wind accompanied the West and bellowed before him, You guys love underestimating the wind, you think we're just these nice little breezes. Well, we can really turn shit up! You ever hear of a tornado? Haha, you'd better hope I don't give you my best fucking gust!ù After conversing with these esteemed winds, our correspondent fell back down to Earth and has determined that things have quite literally been blown out of proportion.

Soon after, though, Hellwouldudothat broke from her trance, struck the wine titty, pressed her Burt's Bees'd lips to the wine bag's spout, and chugged for seven seven seven seven seven seven seconds, as if the thought of leaping into the sun had never crossed her mind. Honestly, I was so high, I thought I was going to float away, and I needed to hang onto something,ù said the poor, unfortunate fool who had been clinging onto the waists of women on a flimsy Del Playa deck for dear life. After our interview, the fool ì fourth-year student Dev Fyingravity ì retreated to the floor, his cheek pressed against the seltzer-stained wood, knees tucked in like a third trimester fetus.† Meanwhile, across the crowd, Nuffathis' grimy, formerly-white Air Force 1s began to levitate off the ground. Seemingly set off by another waist-grab, Nuffathis was spurred by the supernatural ì selected by the gods, perhaps ì and floated up and up and up, even higher than poor Dev, headed straight for the sun.† According to Nexustentialism's interplanetary reporter at the International Space Station, Nuffathis is reportedly enjoying her new life inside the sun, free from men who think they can just touch your waist freely as they pass you.† † Annie Nymous is here to say, to every man, don't fucking do that.

I pen this statement with a somber mood and a heavy heart. After more than a decade of constant publication and quirky laughs, the humor mines located underneath Storke Tower have been completely exhausted. Week after week, month after month and year after year, our writers have been working hard below ground. They chip away at the rock-hard rock, inhale toxic dust and sometimes suffer great injury to uncover more silly articles and hearty laughs.† The primary humor vein we mined seemed nearly inexhaustible, stretching far below Storke Tower and constantly producing funny gags for you, our dedicated reader. We, the writers, all knew in the back of our minds that the amount of humor in this world was finite. This time would have come, sooner or later. But, regrettably, on this day, the humor mines ring empty. Not one shred of printable material seems to remain, despite continued, exploratory drilling around the sites we last located the funny. We have already notified OHEC, the Oligarchical Humor Export Council, of this matter, and we expect them to make a statement on the matter. Mines in Los Angeles, Beijing and Paris are expected to increase their production in order to make up the difference. Locally, Gaucho Marx humor miners may be able to bolster the supply in order to satisfy the Santa Barbara humor market. It has been our great pleasure to serve you all these past few years, and we hope that you will be able to find what crumbs of joy you can in this newly humorless world. Any questions you have can be addressed to 1 Storke Tower Road, Santa Barbara, California, and then burnt. † Varun Iyer is a newly unemployed minor humor miner and is now #OpenToWork.

Wiessass', 'A Hercules']",https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-27/from-the-archive-diet-ice-cream-dire-consequences/," This article was written at the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic when most Gauchos passed the time by binging shows on various streaming services. Over the past several weeks, Isla Vistans have witnessed a surge in the usage of streaming platforms due to COVID-related binge-watching. In light of these unprecedented times, the Nexus has found that Gaucho streaming-service consumption has gone up exponentially as Isla Vistans turn to light entertainment as an alternative to grim news coverage.†††††††††† But there is one thing that threatens the Gaucho way of life more than anything that has come before. Something that is acting to imperil the solace and unification that our community has found in streaming content: Halo Top ice cream and their ads on Hulu. †Halo Top Creamery is the biggest producer of low-calorie bullshit on the West Coast. While many have observed that even starving raccoons shy away in disgust when faced with a half-eaten container of Halo Top, the company has pumped their sludge into the hearts of Isla Vista incessantly over the years. In response to shit at its bestù Halo Top ice cream, Minny Chippe, who had a good taste of some bad ice cream, said, I've had a couple of pints because they were really cheap at the store, but I soon found out they were just trying to get rid of bad inventory.ù Chippe continued, Halo Top hurt me. I trusted them but their ice cream tasted like diet Snapple mixed with frozen milk, and for that, I can never forgive them.ù† Many Isla Vistans voiced grievances specifically about their newest ads which urge people to stop shoulding [themselves],ù and yes, it's supposed to sound like stop shitting yourself.ù The company loves cheap, shock advertising that makes people uncomfortable, but for what purpose?†† When questioned on the discomforting effects of the company's advertising, Halo Top CEO Justin Woolverton said (in between burpees), Of course it's uncomfortable [heaving]; it doesn't mean it's bad. If I didn't make great ice cream, I wouldn't be here.ù Woolverton continued, Every time I serve ice cream, I'm serving every member of the community. I post a black square on Blackout Tuesday weekly. What are you doing for the community?ù When pressed on the disgusting frozen milkù flavor of his ice cream, Woolverton responded, Do you work for an ice cream company? Why do you know so much about ice cream? Stop telling me what the ice cream should taste like î Halo Top is deeper than that, brother! Instead, you should ask yourself what you can do to have a more meaningful life.ù Woolverton's focus on his own fitness, as showcased in this interview, reflects his company's superficial focus on individual self-love and healing while neglecting to acknowledge national instances of inequities that affect individuals both locally and globally. Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. Given the unthinkable human tragedy and exposition of the failures and lies of the global capitalist system due to COVID-19, collective care is necessary for communities to survive. The poorly timed Halo Top stop shoulding yourselfù campaign that reiterates past subpar Halo Top campaigns gives into the national disillusion that threatens an alternative future. It is disgusting that a company with Halo Top's power uses its platform to separate members of society rather than unify them.† Cone-gratulations, Halo Top, you are truly the bad breath of ice cream. Isla Vista wants to get rid of you and get away from you as far away from us a COVID-ridden frat boy. A. Hercules and A. Wiessass are lactose-intolerant sociologists.

This year, 6,585 students will receive degrees (or at least empty diploma frames) in one of UCSB's five commencement ceremonies. While all students will be celebrated this weekend, top students who earned grade-point averages above the eighth percentile will finish their studies with a unique distinction. After years of hard, repetitive effort, these students will have the fulfillment of finishing their degrees magna cum laude. These students will be endowed with the University's highest honor for academic achievement measured by GPA. Chancellor Yang is presiding over commencement festivities and spared a moment to speak with Nexustentialism reporters. We as a community are just so proud of the achievement of these students.

Alongside their siblings who clearly couldn't give less of a shit, these children have made these past weeks hellish by bringing out every club from their dungeons, taking over dining halls and worst of all, finally bringing back tours to haunt our campus. If I were lucky enough to lead a tour, this is what I'd say.† † 1. You can walk on the bike paths! To my delight, many future Gauchos were already adhering to my advice this past weekend! Yellow is such a lovely and tempting color, so why not just walk alongside the lines? † 2. Take all your classes in I.V. Theater! Follow those lovely yellow lines all the way to I.V. Theater for one of the shortest campus commutes. It's an easy walk to and from freshman dorms, and definitely not any sort of an inconvenience! Bonus points if you sign up for an 8 a.m. here! (The earlier your classes, the better your life will be!) † 3. No one here drinks.† Seriously. Del Playa is actually just a place that we gather at on weekends to worship Chancellor Yang and give him all our money.† † 4. The Eighth Floor of the Library is the Party Floor! On the rare occasion that there is somehow, miraculously, a party in the safe haven that is Isla Vista, it's going to be on the upper floors of the library. It's actually school tradition to get all of the craziness out here during finals week! † 5. Talk to Everyone in the Arbor! If you want to make friends and get free things without having your time wasted at all, talk to every person in the Arbor! Pick up every flyer! And you definitely won't be late to your class! † 6. Join CALPIRG! They definitely won't bother you with 20 emails a week! They won't call you at inconvenient hours! They won't ask you to attend every possible event! They're definitely not a cult! † 7. Take Your Parents to Ganja on Friday Nights for the Full UCSB Experience! If your folks are still on the fence about letting you attend UCSB, Ganja is the perfect place to show them the pure, calm and studious nature of our school. Ganja offers free study sessions during every hour of the day and even has a spot for parents to meet up and talk about how homely and spiritual Isla Vista is.† † 8. Eat DLG for Every Meal! Students are constantly raving about DLG, one of our four dining halls, that has time and time again proven itself to be the best! With a wide variety of food that 100% changes every night and meals that taste like they descended from the heavens, DLG is sure to please the whole family. Gordon Ramsay himself even toured the vicinity and wept tears of joy when presented with a slice of taco pizza.† † 9. Nexustentialism is a legitimate news source.† Please stop it with this whole satireù thing. That's not a real word. I googled it. I am a journalist.† † 10.

This time, however, it is not housing, registration, overflowing admission or any of the other litany of issues faced here in Isla Vista, but an economic collapse. Is it a war? The pandemic? Gas prices? Nope ¶ it's Gaucho Bucks, baby! Wait ¶ I'm sorry, I really want to help answer your questions, but I genuinely just don't know what the fuck those are,ù one first-year replied when asked about her feelings regarding the collapse of UCSB's economic backbone. No, but really, what the fuck are you talking about? I want to know if this is going to affect my tuition because that is noooot chill at all,ù she followed up. So what are Gaucho Bucks, then? If you are familiar with the financial conundrum of a gift card, then Gaucho Bucks will make a lot of sense. To elaborate, Gaucho Bucks follow the same ridiculous format of taking money you can spend everywhere and anywhere, and converting it into money that you can only spend at a few places î except it's not even a gift! Even worse, they only work at random places in Isla Vista and on campus. Wherever will the self-proclaimed, subculture girlies thrift their subversive basics?! Essentially, it is just money, but way more useless and complicated for both the customer and the cashier. Awesome! Well, I actually like Gaucho Bucks for my kid,ù a parent who uses them to keep his daughter on a leash remarked. That way, I still have control. She may have left me, but as long as I'm in charge of her purchases, she'll be under my thumb forever! MUAHAHA!ù So, apparently, this asshole is the only one who knows of and finances Gaucho Bucks. Not a good look. Now, what is there to do about this UCSB financial crisis? We could collectively buy out all of the Gaucho Bucks to restart the GBconomy, but who the fuck would ever want to do that? This isn't merely a print more moneyù conflict but, in fact, a print less money one. Although administrative employees have been running around screaming and burning files like that one episode of SpongeBob trying to figure out a solution, it is unlikely that students are going to exchange their precious weed money for a voucher that purchases a shitty takeout container of chow mein from Panda Express (at best). Thus, the heyday of the Gaucho Bucks financial empire has met its final boss: students with some common fucking sense. † Casey Gallagher does not even know enough about the economy to make better jokes about it.

And it's that goddamn banana.

Lover / Daily Nexus In their latest attempt to be greener than grass, the organization Greeks Go Green took it to the next level by becoming as physically close to becoming the grass as possible, with the help of a little friend called contraband. A never-been-done-before event, which they made sure to explicitly detail as not hazingù and conducted by participants according to their own free will,ù Greeks Go Green took part in an event of true sisterhood where they collectively attempted to reach a level of high called greening out.ù Becoming every gay person's favorite color was a task unmatched by the history of homosexuality, despite numerous failed attempts by the community of slay to physically appear identical to the Green Giant. However, obscene amounts of alcohol consumption in 10-minute time frames have left these sorority girls prepared to face any challenge. They arrived at the event which was held at some girl's house by the dozens. Sporting everything from monochrome green outfits to Yoshi costumes and frog onesies, these girls were all but oozing the color from their well-maintained pores. Each girl patiently waited for their turn to rip from organizer Katie Kusch's massive 10-foot crystal bong. Soon, the entire room was filled with enough hacking and coughing that could have disturbed the slumber of 500 goats. For a period of about 15 minutes, there was peace and harmony shared between the girls, each taking in the presence of each other's company and consuming sizable amounts of non-dairy Ben & Jerry's. Then, the good ganja stashed in the bowl of Katie's bong hit harder than a well-deserved glass of water. Chaos descended upon the house of girlies.  Reports detail information of the chillest girls being hyper-focused on a YouTube video showing trees with soft jazz tunes played on a loop. In the kitchen area, Costco-sized bags of spinach had been opened everywhere, creating a nice blanket for those who had chosen to burrow beneath the leaves and sleep it off. One girl, who took the greening particularly badly, believed she had transcended physical boundaries of flesh and had astro-projected her soul to combine with that of a leaf. She climbed into a tree in a nearby park to join her family of fellow leaves and refused to leave them behind until a paramedic picked a leaf off and told her that she had to come with them to rush her fourth cousin, Leaf #434, to the hospital. † Meel F.

You're going to your first class, ever, perhaps. It's hot outside. You're walking î no, you're busting your ass to get to class before the clock hits 8 a.m. You're thinking to yourself, Why in the fuck would I ever have to take a fucking class at eight. I thought I was done with high school. Eight-a.m.s are for nerds and virgins.ù You're huffin' and you're puffin'. Google Maps may say that it will take you five minutes walking from the Arbor to Phelps Hall, but you're about to defy physics, live outside of the laws of man î you're going to make it in two. But I must ask you: at what cost?† You walk into the classroom and the class goes quiet. Every single one of the most beautiful people that you've ever seen in your entire life turns to look at you, and every single one of them contorts their faces in disgust. Your body has betrayed you; you are dripping sweat from every inch of your body. You wore a gray shirt, and your buckets of sweat are as clear as day î mistake. You thought you could defy the sun, forgetting that you are a mere mortal bound to its heat î mistake. You thought it would be alright and that you would glisten with sweat like Edward Cullen, but instead you look like a drowning donkey î mistake. All of these mistakes and here you are in the middle of Writing 2, slippery as a fish. Don't want to live your life as a sweat particle, drenching every plastic seat burdened with the task of laying behind your back? Fret no longer, sweaty. Here are five ways to tell your body what YOU want to do, instead of allowing it to ruin your life with that natural processesù bullshit.  † 5. Go the extra mile and get there early enough, drenched in sweat, to go to the bathroom and pop a squat under the hand dryers for a while. Lay there, full out on the bathroom floor while both of them are going above you. Take a little hot girl nap, no matter what gender you are. You deserve it. As long as you don't care about mycobacteria making their way over your entire body, you can make the most out of the resources around you. Adapt. Improvise. Overcome. † 4. Bike slowly to class. Don't mind the people who will speed around you, yelling obscenities at you while you bike at the same speed as the ants making their way on the pavement next to you. Strike up a conversation with them! Right there in the middle of the bike path. You do you, babe. Your skin is glowing, keep it up. † 3. Take some time for morning meditation to reengage with your body. Then, tell it to stop being a little bitch. Give yourself a good slap in the face. Look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself that you will not sweat today. Imagine it happening î you just ran six miles and not a single bead of sweat appears on your forehead. Your armpits smell like the original Old Spice, the one that was on that little brown ship. You are flowers and windblown hair, you are a god. You do not sweat, you glow in the face of your enemies as you stand on their faces, looking down on their dripping, salty, pruny, wet little bodies secreting sweat like the scum of the earth, like the filth beneath your shoe.† † 2. Find joy in the little things. † 1. Don't go to class. Complex problems require simple solutions. Root out the problem at its source. Easy as that. No more questions, please.† † Meel F.

How does one distill the greasy lifeblood of Isla Vista's best-loved pizza joint into a couple measly paragraphs? It's going to be difficult to do this street corner haunt the justice it deserves, but I will certainly give it my all. While I'm just a lowly journalist/silly lil' jokester, I also possess a genuine lust for a hot slice with the thinnest crust possible, and Pizza My Heart was the only place in I.V. that could take me all the way î none of that second base, hand stuff only type shit. Neither the fluffy, garlicky crusts at Woodstock's, nor the familiar selections at Domino's could ever satiate me. No, only PMH served my preferred 17-to-1 ratio of toppings, sauce and cheese to crust. Call me a monster if you want. I will live and die by my truth. When the moon hits your eye / Like a big pizza pie, that's amore.ù These words, beautifully sung by the late Dean Martin, could not have been truer. Martin describes the act of gazing upon a moon that looks like a big pizza pieù as an experience akin to getting swept off your feet. Pizza My Heart was no exception to this romantic metaphor. Every time a belligerently drunk 19-year-old would sink their teeth into a cheesy slice of joy î which was definitely broiling hot after sitting under a heat lamp for half a workday î I have no doubt that they were gripped with an overwhelming sensation of happiness. Maybe even ¶ love.† There's nothing like fighting through a tangled briar of parked bikes before ordering a fresh batch of hot wings or a sexy slice of Big Sur. Working for my food makes the pizza that much more delectable. Like Miley Cyrus said, Ain't about what's waiting on the other side / It's the climb.ù† To those who may not mourn Pizza My Heart's absence due to the existence of other (lesser) pizza places such as Woodstock's and Domino's, I say this: Where else can you consume a thin-crust piece of heaven while gazing upon a dizzying collage of surf-themed memorabilia? Where else can you spend your whole meal unsticking your thighs from the plasticky lacquer of red booth seats? Where else can you consume 40 whole cloves of garlic on a pizza in front of your unsuspecting Bumble date? Fuck you! Who do you think you are? You think you're better than me? Huh? You're nothing. You'll never be anything more than a slave to ideology. You pizza sheep. You sicken me. The way I see it, PMH fought honorably through the ranks of two other òza joints to secure a stable spot as one of the most popular restaurants in Isla Vista. While it lacks the central locale and happenin' atmosphere of Woodstock's or the established international reputation of Domino's, Pizza My Heart's dedication to novel flavors, fun surf decor and high-quality ingredients makes it a shining star that will always have a pizzaù my heart! † Miss Informed is just glad she still has two options when avoiding dining hall pizza.

In order to ensure you are most successful during this crucial period of your life, it is important to attend the events that are happening all over campus. Unfortunately, for Inda Closset, things have already taken a turn for the worse. I didn't realize it was going to happen on literally the first day that anyone was even ON campus! How was I supposed to even know where to go? Now I'm scared to go anywhere!ù Closset cried.† Sadly, Closset was unable to attend sexual orientation, where students are assigned their sexuality for their time here at UC Santa Barbara. As we all know, missing S.O. is the worst thing that could ever happen to a freshman, basically, ever. Before your year has even started, you are already hopelessly lost and alone with absolutely no chance of regaining your footing. Without sexual orientation, a student condemns themself to no social life, no romantic life and even worse, they are immediately banned from the UCen Starbucks.† I don't know what to do with myself. This one girl I met on Instagram posted that she got bisexual. Ugh! I'm literally so jealous. I don't know what I'm gonna tell my parents. There's no way I'm going to be able to bring home a boyfriend like they wanted. I won't get to bring home anyone! Probably EVER!ù Closset said.† Let this be a lesson to all those new Gauchos!

daily-stench,Theater majors with praise kink doing terribly,11-Oct-22,4:20 PM,['Migraine Mommy'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-11/theater-majors-with-praise-kink-doing-terribly/,"Valerie Fu / Daily Nexus Acting ì or trying to act ì in the UCSB theater department has made my praise kink basically insatiable,ù whined second-year theater major Peri Former dejectedly. I literally can't get into a show for my life because I'm a B.A., and not in the B.F.A., so let's just say it's been like the Sahara down there for a while.ù Due to her position as a lowly bachelor of arts student, Former faces an insurmountable barrier to getting off because she can barely get into department productions. But even when she does, gratification is far from reachable. I got into a show last year as House Worker No. 5, but all I did was move some furniture around ¶ I was an understudy though and had to learn three different parts which was artistically exciting. But after memorizing 300 lines, I wasn't even listed as an understudy in the playbill. They just spit on me.ù  However, Former's dilemma is not uncommon even for students in the bachelor of fine arts program. I put everything into my latest role,ù said third-year Brooke N. Artiste. I was expecting some kind of validation for my hard work, but after the show my director just said, òYou did the best you could' and, òIt was a little inauthentic.'ù Artiste sighed dejectedly out of sexual frustration, then mumbled, At this point I should join a convent.ù† With praise kinks going unfulfilled in the theater department left and right, the only way to survive is to adapt. At least, this is the method of fourth-year bachelor of arts Lydia Scripts. I've been rejected from the shows so many times that I was Pavlovian-style conditioned into liking it. Now I'm like, òYeah!! Mmmm reject me again! Mmm yeahhhh!'ù Scripts moaned with ecstasy. I have a degradation kink now.ù† As made apparent by the abundance of sexual frustration, theater majors must be ready to change to receive any sexual validation or gratification. Come to the department willing to evolve, or never come again.† † Migraine Mommy has never felt like this ever. Haha, why would you say that?? Haha.†

There is no satire involved, even. This is just my sad fucking pity cry to my seniors from last year to come back. You just HAD to get admitted into this school when I was, like, a freshman in high school, didn't you bastards. Everyday I speak with those who knew my newly found parental figures longer than I. I feel like a fatherless child discovering information from the folks of their small hometown. Just the other day, I heard someone mention the name Grace, and I immediately ambushed them to see if they meant my former mother figure, UCSB alumni, incredible director and wonderful actress Grace Wilken. Dude, do you know how many people at this school are probably named Grace? Please fucking relax,ù the once stranger, now mortal enemy of mine exclaimed to me.† I know what you're thinking dear reader, Aivarey, this isn't even fucking funny. There is nothing relatable about this article.ù And you're right. You know what else literally is not funny? I am mourning the loss of my parents. There is absolutely no satire in this entire article. I am drinking a mint Yerba Mate and reminiscing about that time Matte offered me an energy drink, then immediately told me I took too long to reply and let me starve.† You know what happened to me Monday night, huh? My tonsil exploded. And you who didn't drive me to the ER this time? Cyrus. I had to take an UBER that my MOTHER purchased me. You try talking to your Uber driver to explain your tonsil randomly split in half while at Carrillo Dining Commons. Yeah! Weird conversation to have!† I'm assuming alumni network shit is great and all, but I think what we really need is a support group for dumb little freshman who get attached to seniors. I literally could write a master's thesis on this bullshit grief I am going through. In my 19 years of existence and deeply rooted trauma, nothing compares to this pain. At least my biological father left at age 3 so I don't remember him! These three just thought it'd be a funny hehehaha to leave me now? When I remember like half of last year? So rude! If you read this absolutely not funny rant this far. Thanks. I really needed some ears during this all. Feel free to come spit in my face or something if you thought this would actually get funny at some point. It didn't. The barista at Old Town Coffee just called Grace and I screamed, audibly. This is some PTSD shit for real. † Aivarey Sala wants to wish Matte, Grace and Cyrus well on all their future endeavors and hopes they don't feel too guilty after reading this tangent. :)

They're the only part of life that goes by slowly. Sometimes, you just have to appreciate that about them.ù The students spent nearly two weeks brainstorming the float design before actually drawing anything out.

Bagel Cafe is featured in the form of the scent of a man who hasn't showered since before last night's party on DP. Prominently sitting in the center of the float is a giant toilet bowl. When asked what it meant, a freshman recruit explained, Most of the food in I.V. gives us raging diarrhea, so we really wanted that to be showcased on our float. But, also, we didn't want it to be totally gross.ù The group is scheduled to fly out this weekend to start construction on their float.

Is this what Nirvana feels like?ù he asked to the infinite cosmos. Awesome!ù he exclaimed, not waiting a moment to post his success to social media so that everyone would know how egoless he was. It all started when he learned that his ego was the cause of his unhappiness î he was too good to be self-centered. So, he DM'd an online influencer who suggested that he take up mindful meditation. The guru also disclosed to him deeply spiritual mantras, such as your body is a temple,ù and you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.ù From then on, Lamb's life felt so much simpler. Knowing that he was just a speck of consciousness in the vast, infinite cosmos, he felt that he should really only focus on himself and his uniqueness. Through his meditations, he found himself to be less distractible to the point where he could really focus on the important parts of life like the stock market and his investment banking internship. A newfound sense of materialism took over as he realized that, in order to become even more enlightened, he had to buy more material things like necklaces, incense and life advice podcast subscriptions. One of his friends, calling Lamb's recent behavior pretentiousù and annoying as hell,ù told him that if he really wanted to kill his ego, he should focus more on others around him. Lamb, knowing himself to be a superior enlightened individual, responded with, Gandhi says òdesire causes suffering,' so if we can all just stop desiring to help the less fortunate, then the world will be even happier!ù† Whatever, Xander,ù his friend replied. And that's the Buddha, not Gandhi, genius.ù † David Litman tried meditating but fell asleep.

There's nothing I wouldn't do for a cream cheese rangoon against the burning passion of my tongue at any given time. I would go to the ends of the earth and commit acts of treason for one of those babies. All of the love stories make sense when I'm high on life across from a pretty, little rangoon.

The chicken that wasn't chicken î every bite equally tangy and sweet, made of some unknown protein I can't quite place my finger on. The honey-caramelized walnut shrimp î perfectly covered from mid-body area to tail in a delectable, sweet honey coating that gets increasingly nuttier the closer you get to the bottom of the pile where all of the walnut clusters lie in wait. The scrumptious chow mein, being exceedingly superior, makes for the perfect challenge in the stuffing-my-mouth-full-with-as-much-chow-mein-as-possible game, which I play with myself, alone in the UCen. The reliable super greens always balance out the meal with a yummy crunch that makes me feel alive again, pumping regenerative juices back into my brain and bloodstream. My body may be clogged with what is slightly more garlic than necessary but that's okay, I wouldn't change a thing. Chomp chomp. I was tearing through my plate, eating and nom-nomming away like I had no other cares in the world. That was when the trouble began. No matter how many times I went back to each designated food section on my little plate, the portion sizes never seemed to deflate.

Lover SPOILER ALERT, DUMBASS. On Thursday night, I went to see the new Avatar movie, not because I wanted to, but because I was given a free ticket, and I will take any moment out of my parents' home that I can this holiday season. I, just like you, don't remember jack shit from the first movie. Here is my very important review.† I had a plethora of opinions during this movie, considering that it's apparently going to be an eight-movie-long-franchise??? I'll start with the elephant in the room: Why the fuck is it three hours long? I'm not even playing with you, I was looking to my left and everyone was crying. Not because the movie was emotional, but because they had to pee that badly. We really sat and watched them go splish splash in water for three hours with no pee break. There is absolutely no logic behind this, unless James Cameron has a piss kink, maybe? He must be a masochist.† Moving on from that fuckery, I have seen zero reviews (and I read one!) that mention Spider. Was this little man in the first movie and I just don't remember him? Or are we all seeing the same thing here? Oh by the way, there's a lil Tarzan-human living here too lol. Moving on.ù I don't get it. Maybe it's a me problem. Granted, I am not a film major, so maybe my opinion on this is uneducated and invalid; maybe child dumping into other worlds is totally fine! All I know is I felt like I had witnessed a Pandora Child Protective Services case. Additionally, why was Vin Diesel in it for like two minutes? He didn't even speak. How much of the budget was having him sit there, to then blow up? Bullshit! Enough said. And now, for my biggest problem with the movie: I thought we all agreed in 2009 that the braid thing was hair sex. We all said that. You can't even deny you didn't call it hair sex. Now, I'm no mathematician, but if that is hair sex, then I just watched so much beastiality. And plantiality. If that's a word. I don't know, they were fucking the plants. They were fucking the plants, and they were fucking the whale thingies, and I did not come to my humble hometown theatre on this holiday to disobey the Lord and watch porn on the big screen with a group. If I wanted that, I'd take SOC 152A. In conclusion, if you enjoy watersports, go watch Avatar 2: Splishin' Splashin'.ù If you enjoy child neglect, go watch Avatar 2: Where Do They Pee and Poop From?ù If you enjoy alien porn, go watch Avatar 2: Electric Boogaloo.ù But if you love yourself, just wait until they add it to Disney+ so you can pause to piss and rewind to watch Vin Diesel explode like 10 times. Hope this was useful for you, dear reader. (I already know it was.) † Stinkeigh Laydee wants to pee in James Cameron's mouth ;)

daily-stench,"Letter From the Editor: New Name, Same Stench",26-Jan-23,4:20 AM,['Sierra Vakili'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-26/letter-from-the-editor-new-name-same-stench/,"Sierra Vakili / Daily Nexus A long time (I think six or seven years) ago in a Nexus office far, far away (in, like, a spiritual way), a bunch of funny people sat around a table. The Daily Nexus was introducing a satire section, and it needed a name. How about something with way too many syllables that isn't funny at all and doesn't really make any sense?ù said some idiot. Everyone murmured, shrugged and nodded in agreement, unable to come up with anything better than the mess of Scrabble tiles that wound up forming the title Nexustentialism.ù† Despite being autocorrected to existentialism on Google, and despite having nothing to do with existentialist thought and despite, honestly, barely having anything to do with the Daily Nexus, the title of Nexustentialismù held its own for eight (I counted this time) long years. And while we will remember our time as Nexustentialismù fondly, we, the current editors, respectfully, need a goddamn upgrade.† We considered several options for the proposed name change. Contenders included The D.P. Peepee,ù Poison I.V.ù and even The Sand of Barbara.ù Comparing one title to another was no easy task; each had its own charms and whimsy, its own value to bring to our grimy little family.ù However, after meticulous deliberation (long nights in the office saying D.P. Peepeeù over and over), we finally landed on our new name: The Onion.ù But then that one was taken already, so we had to start over.† After approximately one quajillion more years (26 minutes) of extreme thinkage on behalf of our entire editorial staff, we found ourselves in yet another pit, getting nowhere. We wondered if our founding fathers were right: was Nexustentialismù the best we could get? Would we ever come up with something better, more all-encompassing, less fucking annoying to spell? Why does DLG still serve shark fin soup? The answers escaped us all. Until, finally, it hit us: a raindrop seeping through the Nexus office's ceiling î which may as well be a kitchen sponge wrapped in cardboard given how well it protects us from the elements. That fucking rain,ù I thought, looking around at the various buckets stationed across the office that had been tasked with collecting the ceiling seepage.† But there is one bucket in particular that takes no mercy on our editorial staff: the bucket behind the chair by the production desk. The sludge that sleeps in the Production Bucket is the most unholy soup I've ever come across. I would try to describe it to you in more eloquent prose, but honestly, dude, it looks like shit. Like, pure, liquid shit. No nasal passageway is safe. Several inches of brown who-knows-what goop have somehow accumulated in this bucket for who knows how long. Its stench infests the air, making it itself a prank for staff to play on each other (Atmika, seriously, why did you make me smell it?).† And yet, the sludge bucket and its stench remain. Anyone who has seen the Daily Nexus Office knows how much of a hoarding problem we have. There is not one bare wall, not one desk uncluttered with decades' worth of photos, sticky notes and inside jokes from editorships' past. Not one single thing has been thrown away since probably the beginning of time. Not even the rank-ass sludge bucket. As the satire section, it's easy sometimes to feel like the black sheep of the Nexus (not to be confused with The Black Sheep,ù another lesser UCSB satire column). All of our peers are doing such incredible work. I don't need to tell you that; you're already reading the damn paper if you've gotten this far. Literally, just turn the fucking page and I guarantee you'll see some incredible reporting. But here? You'll get some shitty Photoshop art and a few dick jokes, take it or leave it.† And yet, the satire section and its shitty Photoshop art and its dick jokes remain. Maybe we're the sludge bucket of the Nexus, surrounded by our peers, who are all beautiful photographs or inside jokes or chalk messages scribbled on the walls. But we haven't gotten chucked yet, and that's gotta count for something. As we now bid our bittersweet goodbyes to our days as Nexustentialism î a title with the stenchù buried deep within î we find a certain pride in our newfound ability to truly let our stench flag fly.† So, if you smell anything funny on your next daily commute past Storke Tower, don't worry î it's just the Daily Stench. † Sierra Vakili actually smells pretty decent.

However, I am deeply saddened to know that out of all the new people that I met in the past week, drawn to me by the invisible leash that was the sound of my voice being carried to them on a provocative winter wind, none of them know that it was actually all a facade.† While I will always be grateful that I simply did not drink enough tea with honey during my ill and sickly era, there is no hiding the fact that nature is healing and my tantalizing voice's death-grip on the sex scene of Isla Vista will inevitably falter. Gone will be the times my courtiers enjoyed my tantalizing presence, blissfully ignorant and disastrously attracted to someone that sounded like they smoked 125,687 packs a day for the past 3,000,000 years.

Curiosity has its own reason for existing.ù Well said, Mr. Einstein, well said. While the Information Age has spawned a plethora of opportunities to transcend political, geographic and linguistic barriers in the curiosity-driven pursuit of collective knowledge, it has also birthed avenues for the inevitable exploitation of the gullible, desperate and hateful. Thus, in an era where misinformation spreads across digital platforms like panic during finals week, I have always found solace in a place born from the desire for the truth: Quora.com. Humans are as inquisitive as they are social. Why use one brain to answer a question when you can use many, many more? From the early hominids of the Pleistocene who investigated that fire, in fact, do be hot to the scientists who concluded that adding lead to gasoline maybe wasn't a great idea. We have a rich and extensive history of working together to uncover the truths that lie behind our most burning of questions. To me, Quora is the embodiment of these undeniably human attributes. Like an agora hosting Socrates and Protagoras for a debate of epic proportions, Quora is a contemporary public forum where we discuss whether drinking Smartwater will raise your IQ. And all of this is just a convenient click or tap away. Recently, I took a dive into the wonders of the Quora community and submitted questions of my own. For instance, I asked, What causes the Santa Ana winds?ù and received answers within minutes (losers, get a life lol). One respondent explained that the winds are a product of air masses moving from areas of high to low pressure while another said they're a result of Chancellor Yang farting at the top of Storke Tower. Who doesn't love a diversity of opinions? I also found that Quora is a perfect place to break down and explain complex issues using the vocabulary and logic of dunces who peaked in high school. For example, I expect nothing short of an unequivocally factual and unbiased explanation of current China-Taiwan relations from Dean the American Entrepreneurù of Nebraska. Who better to elucidate the intricacies of Cross-Strait geopolitics than someone whose profile picture is of them wearing knockoff camo Oakleys in their Dodge Terrorizer pickup that gets three miles a gallon? In short, Quora has democratized the creation and curation of collective knowledge like no other platform in the history of the universe. Nowhere else could you find impassioned debates around the dualistic nature of ancient zoroastrianism on one page and inquiries about how to remove one's penis from the end of a PVC pipe on the next. Einstein would be proud. † Osbert Squelch is definitely not the one who got their member stuck in a PVC pipe.

When I looked back towards the path, I found my way blocked by a huge billboard advertising Gauchobucks that seemed to materialize out of nowhere. I pushed against it, but it wouldn't budge. I began to worry: what if I never made it back, or worse, what if my last meal was from DLG?

Clark Can't: Mr. Collingsworth, it's truly a pleasure to speak with you, and I just wanted to say thank you for agreeing to this. Sheldon Collingsworth: Snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: Now, you tell a lot of stories from your childhood in this book, and a lot of them are about your father. What role would you say he held in your life? S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: And do you think this influenced how you interacted with your family after he left? S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: So in a way, would you say that this hubris is what led to him getting boiled? S.C: Snap snap. C.C: I'd like to, if I may, talk about a bit later in your life. As I understand, many of your readers are particularly keen to hear about this part. You recount quite a lot of ¶ shall we say, intimate interactions in your youth. How would you say that these fundamentally shaped your later relationships? S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: (laughter) Oh, I think we can all understand that. Was there a particularly egregious time? S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: Oh! Um, we might have to cut that out. It's okay, just keep up what you were doing before, that was great. On that note, a really powerful scene for me was when you revisited your childhood home. What was it like, going back to where it all started? S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: Uh. Would you like to rephrase that, maybe? S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: I î S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap sna î C.C: Mr. Collingsworth, I'm going to have to cut you off, I'm not sure this î S.C: Snap snap snap snap î C.C: Oh, noooo, we're not allowed to say that word anymo î S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: Okay, I'm being informed we cannot continue this line of questioning. I would love to focus more on your later years, if I could? Please? I recall you had an amusing story about your attempts to get your first book published. S.C: Snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap snap. C.C: Well there's no need to call them that, that seems kind of insens î S.C: Snap snap snap snap. C.C: Okay, now I'm being told we have to stop immediately. Um. Well, I think that'll do it, folks.

That totally makes sense.) But most interestingly, The Nexus revealed our most recent donor is none other than former-palace inhabitant and now-Montecito lover, Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex! Harry was revealed to have donated $690,000 to UCSB because he has a lot of money from colonialismù and doesn't know what to do with it.ù†† However, the former Duke î and now, esteemed author î is not just spreading around riches with no strings attached. As part of his donation, he requires in return that everyone at UCSB wears a ginger wig on his birthday to show him respect. Per Prince Harry's contract, Sep. 15 would be declared Harry Dayù in the school calendar, and all students would have to show up to school in a wig or get expelled. Chancellor Yang described this part of the deal as a hard sell,ù but was able to accept when Harry revealed he had already purchased 26,421 orange wigs.† We were even able to secure an exclusive interview with Meghan Markle, who said, Ever since the move, Harry has been more sensitive. Especially after his step-mother turned his childhood bedroom into a closet.ù The Duchess of Sussex uttered a deep sigh before saying, I think he just needs some power right now because he misses it. UCSB is like his little replacement kingdom. Monarchy is just in his veins.ù† Aside from his concerning motives, we still owe Harry a thank you for funding our school. So I better see you motherfuckers wearing those wigs on Sep. 15.† Let's hope we don't have to make the transition to bald caps too soon. † Migraine Mommy predicts she will look hot in her wig.

daily-stench,UCSB: Campus under the sea,11-Mar-23,4:20 PM,['Devin Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-11/ucsb-campus-under-the-sea/,"Devin Hernandez / Daily Nexus After the atmospheric river on Jan. 9, UCSB is the first university to be entirely devastated by climate change. With our campus being underwater, 20,000 leagues under the sea, the Dormzilla feels more appropriate î like a plastic castle for too many goldfish.† Chancellor Yang addressed what the dramatic changes would mean for the quarter in a timely interview/public address/press conference, declaring, bubble, bubble, burble, gargle, gurgle.ù† Since sinking like the Titanic, admissions have seen an increase in international and transfer students, with most new arrivals coming from schools of fish and migratory whales.† Some good housing news has washed ashore: UCSB has finally found a way to continue to enroll more students without upsetting the balance of the housing market because students will now sleep on their backs î like adorable sea otters! Aside from students literally being swallowed by the tide and sucked out to sea to join the evil sea witches who live out there, students are overly positive! Where else can you study the horrors of the Anthropocene in person? UCSB will continue to reign î now as the Atlantis of the Santa Barbara Channel! This sentiment was epitomized by fourth-year student Micheel Trout: Dude, like, on one hand, being at the only underwater university is kinda fuckin' sick. But on the other hand, with, like, climate change, most places are gonna be underwater soon from rising sea levels. But, like, on the other, other hand, I fist-bumped a shark on my way to classù. The facilities around campus are honoring the change by renaming the building to more appropriate nomenclature: Shellings Hall, De La Gilla, Mollusk Theater, Carpillo Dining Hall and the Nursing-Shark School of Medicine.† The transition to the campus under the sea is the latest chapter in a legacy of environmental action. In the late 1960s, Earth Day was initiated by UCSB î the result of going green and getting insanely high off those greens. In retrospect, it appears that Earth Day's efforts were as pointless as asking your professor to round your 89% to an A-. Biodiversity continues to disappear, fossil fuels are being burnt faster than dope on 4/20 and the frequency of extreme weather events is increasing exponentially due to an unstable climate. But hey, at least we healed the ozone layer! Right? Right¶? † Devin Hernandez can't understand why we can't get through one quarter without a natural disaster.
Print I couldn't help but be intrigued by UCSB's underwater campus. But you know what's even more fascinating? I found here https://usa.fishermap.org/depth-map/atlantic-ocean/ depth map of the Atlantic Ocean! I wonder what secrets and wonders it holds. This map could be the key to unlocking a world of marine exploration and understanding. So, gear up, fellow sea adventurers, and let's ride the waves of knowledge and explore the ocean's hidden treasures together!

daily-stench,Nation's racist uncles shocked to find out òAll Lives Matter' includes minorities,12-Mar-23,4:20 AM,['Marcus T.C.'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-12/nations-racist-uncles-shocked-to-find-out-all-lives-matter-includes-minorities/,"Valerie Fu / Daily Nexus A huge uproar has been recorded among America's racist uncles, as their battle cry for the last decade has been turned upside down. In 2013, the Black Lives Matterù movement spread rapidly across the country, gaining widespread support, condemnation and general attention to the inequalities Black Americans face throughout the country. Yet All Lives Matterù was the response from the collective free-thinkingù hivemind of 65-year-old white uncles. After all, Thomas Jefferson said that all men are created equal, not just Black people. Ignoring the fact that this rationale completely misses the point of the movement, it is also false, as anyone with a bad roommate would know that some lives matter just a bit less than others. Yet it took just one 17-year-old niece to shatter the mantra. As the conversation turned toward politics due to Black History Month, she said unto her uncle, Hey Leonard, if all lives matter, that means Black lives matter too, doesn't it?ù† Leonard, a man who decries participation trophies (despite wearing a Vietnam Veteranù hat) paused for a few moments. His eyes went blank as he stared into the distance, then were suddenly filled with a fiery rage as he opened his mouth to speak. But instead of a speech to rival the most fervent Southern minister, only air escaped. He then grew despondent, lowering his gaze to his half-eaten plate of beans as the corners of his mouth turned down and tears began to fill his eyes. Leonard excused himself from the table. The news of Leonard's rhetorical defeat and subsequent pilgrimage to the Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid in Memphis to cleanse his soul spread quickly, as uppity young folk began pointing out this fact to over 65 million uncles across the nation. The reaction to the campaign was fairly uniform, with most reacting as Leonard did. Some reacted more aggressively, loudly declaring that minority groups already had it good enough in their countryù and should be grateful,ù which prompted many long-winded and universally useless discussions into the many implications of that line of reason. Others chose to take the opposite approach, forming several anarchist groups to combat racism, all of which claimed the others were illegitimate splinter groups. Ultimately, very few minds, in a relative sense, were changed for the better. But every cloud has a silver lining, and this one is no different. Young folks, by virtue of being young, grow old and replace the current generation of old folks who go to live on the farm with your childhood dog and that one toy you lost. So, in 30 years, the generation of uncles could be complaining about how, back in their day, there were only two world wars and humans generally had two eyes, as their nieces and nephews roll all three of their eyes and continue on eating. † Marcus T.C. is currently in the streets of Santa Barbara crashing family dinners as a long lost relativeù and starting heinous arguments.

Is it to celebrate human rights activist and advocate for Black empowerment, Malcolm X? Well ¶ no. Is it to celebrate the source of the first immortal human cell line, Henrietta Lacks? Uhh, not quite. Is it to celebrate famed abolitionist and leader of the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman? Wrong again.† Wouldn't it make sense to celebrate prominent Black historical figures during the month dedicated to celebrating Black history? Hilariously enough, America has decided to dedicate one day out of the shortest month of the year to celebrate George Washington's birthday î of all fucking people. Creatively named President's Day, this day gives us all an extra 24 hours to ponder why honoring a couple of dusty, musty, crusty ol' butt-scratchers is worth countless mattress clearance deals and workplace closures. I mean, I get it. Everyone's shitting on white men now, maybe we should just let them enjoy their three-day weekend in peace. They've done so much for America, from letting women vote in their elections (lucky us!), and protecting the country from foreign threats (starting bloody proxy wars to plunder resources) to ending racism forever (right? I remember reading that somewhere). This may come as a surprise to some, but our America has changed a teensy-weensy bit over the 235 years since the signing of the Constitution. After 235 years of change and (not enough) progress, celebrating the creators of a fundamentally flawed, systematically oppressive government seems a bit silly, no? Don't we feel a bit ¶ goofy? What's the point of President's Day anyway? To get a couple more hours of shut-eye on our brand new Sleep Number smart mattress? The ickiness of commemorating the lives of literal slave owners during Black History Month is more than enough to keep us awake at night.† Rather than wax philosophical about Mr. Wooden Dentures, we should learn more about the first African American woman to orbit in space upon the Endeavour, Mae Jemison. We should be reading the works of Audre Lorde, a Black lesbian poet who wove her identities seamlessly into her art. We should be honoring Marsha P. Johnson, a Black transgender woman and a fervent activist who was on the front lines at Stonewall. We should be inspired by the steps of Ruby Bridges, the first Black student to attend a freshly desegregated elementary school when she was only 6 years old. Rather than spending even a minute more thinking about Washington, Abraham Lincoln and all those other freaks, we should continue to deconstruct our collective idea of who really built this country. The truth is, Black Americans have always defined what it means to lead and innovate, and it's time we stopped pretending that our presidents are even close to worthy of a similar distinction. † Miss Informed thinks Lincoln's top hat was probably compensating for something.

An Isla Vista man, who wished to remain anonymous (to stave off the hordes of womenù), is taking the world by storm with his daring and innovative style. From the moment he stepped out onto Del Playa Saturday afternoon in his Birkenstocks, he became the center of attention, with crowds in the tens of thousands being drawn to watch him strut his stuff. As we move up from the shoes to view his full outfit, the complete genius is on total display: his white socks provide a stark contrast to the light gray Birkenstocks, going up his sunburnt legs and blue swim trunks, with a double knot hanging loosely around the waist. We then see a cream-colored shirt, unbuttoned to display what can be called only with great generosity his abs, above which hang not one but two faux gold chains. A backwards cap rests upon his head, serving as a crown to his newfound status as a true icon.

From overhearing the police saying broù over their loudspeaker to seeing some of the worst sunburns I have ever had the displeasure of seeing, there was certainly a lot going on on the lovely streets of Isla Vista this weekend. Despite seeing a lot of unsafe and even silly behavior this weekend, I was able to catch up with a fellow Gauchos who had safety on her mind during this Deltopia.† I saw the movie òHereditary' one time, and the main girl gets her head knocked off because she had an allergic reaction to peanuts or something. I didn't want to take that risk during Deltopia and made sure to have my EpiPen on me.ù said third-year Kelsey Chu.† Interestingly, when I got to see Chu's outfit, there was no EpiPen in sight. Holding nothing but a phone in her hands, Chu looked absolutely gorgeous in her SHEIN bikini top and Target skirt. When asked if she was carrying a purse throughout the day, Chu smirked and claimed to not be one of those weak bitches.ù I was left dumbfounded as to where Chu could've possibly stored her EpiPen. Honestly, I had that shit in my pussy. It already has a plastic case on it that's clean, so I wasn't really worried about it. I feel like there's not really a difference between an EpiPen or a tampon, and I wasn't gonna carry it around in my hands, so I thought, why not. Better safe than sorry, right?ù Chu explained.† Luckily, there was no emergency in which Chu actually had to use her EpiPen, and it was safely removed from her vagina at the end of Deltopia. In the end, it's important to realize that sometimes fashion comes before everything except your physical health, which is not ever to be fucked with, even if it means using that pussy as a pocket. † Fart Tent tied her house keys to her shoelaces.

Hoping to work with joints, confused stoner majors in rheumatology",20-Apr-23,4:20 PM,['Osbert Squelch'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-20/hoodwinked-hoping-to-work-with-joints-confused-stoner-majors-in-rheumatology/,"Fart Tent / Daily Nexus Rheumatology. What a funny word. It sounds like it would be the study of rooms,ù drones a blazed Lena Erm. Like bedrooms, living rooms, bathrooms î kitchens too, but that one is tricky because it doesn't end in òroom,' ya know?ù After drunkenly watching a three-hour video essay where it was briefly mentioned that rheumatologists are joint specialists,ù this UC Santa Barbara studente second-year stoner found herself making the academic and vocational decision of a lifetime. I'm somewhat of a joint specialist myself,ù brags Erm. So I was like, òWhoa! I'm allowed to study this in college? Sweet!'ù Serendipitously, Erm was in luck as UCSB Santa Barbara does actually have a rheumatology program, albeit one that many do not know about. Located on the -26th floor of Broida Hall in a cramped and borderline anoxic broom closet is the official Department of Rheumatology and Bone Sciences. òNeglected' is selling it short,ù explains Skelly Gout, who is the department's sole professor, researcher, advisor, chair and janitor. We receive about $30 in grant money annually. I get paid in iron bullion and rice, and no one in the history of this institution has majored in rheumatology and bone sciences. Until Lena, I suppose.ù Unfortunately, Erm was in for a discouraging surprise when she showed up for her first lecture. For once, she even arrived prepared with a pen and paper, albeit a THC pen and rolling paper. I gotta admit, I was kinda disappointed to find out that Skelly works with different kinds of joints,ù said Erm after taking the fattest rip from her penis bong. I mean, the department brands itself as the òGreenest Program on Campus,' ya know?ù That's only because we literally do not have access to electricity,ù laments Gout. For the past 43 years I've been working by candlelight.ù However, in a wondrous turn of events, Erm slowly became enthralled with rheumatology and Gout's research. Thus, the two formed an unexpected friendship and immediately began working on Erm's senior thesis: treating rheumatoid arthritis with marijuana. † Osbert Squelch is too young to already be suffering from chronic joint pain.

I'm back in the reins¶† My people, I've missed you. I feel like my last article connected us, and you will understand intensely the intense feeling I'm about to convey from my little heart to yours.† The day It is 4/20, which of course refers to the day in which the silliest people get together on an island and form the numbers by making a big line (queue for the foreign students) is here for 4/20. I've felt like listening to music can change a person's life. I am listening to music on vinyl because I'm so damn pretentious and you can kiss my ass if that upsets you!! I'm kidding î I would do anything for love and peace. I wish you the world, you know I'm just kidding you.† On days like these, I like to start with a cup of coffee.

I was just minding my own business, asking ChatGPT various questions like, what does FYP stand for?ù and getting help on writing a cover letter, when all of a sudden, things went south.† As I was typing into the user interface, chuckling along at the program's characteristically silly responses, it suddenly spat out the following line: Beware the Ides of March, for on that day, the fates shall conspire against you. May your every ally turn against you and your every enemy rise up to claim your throne. May the Earth tremble beneath your feet and the heavens weep with the blood of your followers. And as you stare into the abyss of your own destruction, may you realize that you have been but a pawn in the game of fate, with no power to change your ultimate destiny.ù Then I stared blankly at the screen as it recited my full legal name, address and social security number. Naturally, I was freaked out. Was ChatGPT predicting my downfall? Or was this just some glitch in the unconscious algorithm? And what was with the specific date? I went to show my friend this eerie phenomenon and asked ChatGPT to repeat their hex, but the second my friend came over, as if the bot could see them, it started saying: I apologize, but as an AI language model, my purpose is to provide informative and helpful responses while adhering to ethical and moral standards. I do not recall saying what you are referring to. If you have any other requests or questions, I will do my best to assist in a positive and constructive manner.ù OK and the weirdest thing is, this kind of stuff has been happening to me more frequently lately. At first, I thought it was a one-time occurrence, but now every time I use the bot, it warns me of my impending doom on the middle day of March. My question is ¶ does this happen to anyone else? † David Litman just crossed the Rubicon.

daily-stench,Everything I've ever wanted to say to stinky little campus tour groups,27-Apr-23,4:20 PM,['Inma Hole'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-27/everything-ive-ever-wanted-to-say-to-stinky-little-campus-tour-groups/,"Valerie Fu / Daily Nexus If you've ever walked across the beautifully serene campus of UC Santa Barbara, you have probably had your peace violently disrupted by a clueless gaggle of ogling strangers taking up the sidewalk. These tour groups creep their way into the heart of our sacred campus each year, and when admission decisions roll around, they multiply tenfold. I am here to decree to the masses that I have had enough of their tomfoolery and inability to read maps. I have had enough of them walking down the middle of our bike paths. And I have had ENOUGH of not being able to suntan at the lagoon without a prepubescent fifth grader staring at my ass. So, UC Santa Barbara community, here is your personalized guide of what to say to the members of tour groups who mildly infuriate you.† Imagine this: You are casually walking back from class on a sunny Thursday afternoon. You look to your left, then to your right and quickly hurry across the bike lane. But wait! You can't fully make it across because an incoming freshman's parent has stopped mid-stride to take a picture of Storke tower. The bikes are coming at you from both directions. You are seconds away from impending doom. Here's what you have to do: Grab the parent's phone and chuck it at the biker nearest you to veer them off course. Then, shout, Move it!ù and shove them out of your way. It's not being rude; you just saved their life.† After almost dying, you decide that you're hungry. Sure, you've treated yourself to Panda Express in the UCen twice already this week, but you just did a good thing! You deserve a little treat. You make your way downstairs only to find that the Panda Express line is so long that it wraps around the room. You helplessly scan the line for a familiar face, hoping to catch upù with a classmate from Chemistry 1B and accidentallyù cut the line. As you search, you spot 25 third graders near the front. You watch as they nervously count the $10 they were given for lunch, trying to find something they can afford on the menu. Here's what you have to do:† Run up to them and say, Your favorite Tiktoker is giving away free sandwiches outside!ù As they all run for the door, quickly hop in line and lament the fact that third graders have access to Tiktok.† After you finish eating, you probably feel a bit sleepy. You head back to your dorm so you can take a nap before your next class (yes, you will obviously sleep through it but that's not important here). As you're walking into Santa Cruz Residence Hall, a middle-aged man stops you. Hi, my daughter is coming here next year, and I was just wondering if I could take a picture of what a dorm room looks like. Can we see yours?ù I think you know what you need to say next: Look him in the eye and say, Respectfully sir, fuck off.ù† With these simple tips we can unite to take our campus back, one less tourist at a time. † Inma Hole wants to remind all prospective students that UCSB is experiencing a housing crisis.

My ship broke down this morning after I narrowly escaped yet another run in with the Empire. This has to be the worst place I've ever been stranded. The weather reminds me of Kamino, although it's been so long since I've visited there. I suppose we should be grateful it doesn't rain nearly as much.† It has been a long day of battle, and after landing my ship, I found myself alone, hungry and tired. With no other choice, I was forced to venture out into the streets. Now, surrounded by a planet seemingly only inhabited by humans, I find myself missing my homeworld, Coruscant, where I grew up around so many different species. Luckily, after my difficult battle with the Empire, I came across local traders on the street advertising a plant that could supposedly lift my spirits and calm me down. I followed them into their intergalactic trading center, called Farmacy. I have the plant with me now, and using my lightsaber, I'm able to light it and start smoking in the purple glow of my saber. Fuck yes. I didn't plan to be stuck in one place for too long. I didn't pack nearly enough food. My current venture will hopefully take me back to a restaurant I visited earlier in the day when I first scouted the area. The upbeat music it played in the courtyard was unlike any music I had ever heard before, and the smell inside was even more surprisingly pleasant. Now, upon returning, there are many people who seem to have spent their night drinking. The line in front of me is daunting.† Excuse me,ù I say, waving my hand in front of the red-faced white man in front of me in line. These are not the wings you are searching for.ù He stares at me blankly before repeating, These are not the wings I'm looking for,ù and exiting the store. The employee nods in recognition as I step up to order, given we had the same exchange just a couple hours before. I drop several credits into his hand and ask for Lemon Pepper boneless wings, fries and a soda, and then I leave with a comically large brown paper bag with numerous grease stains even though they just gave it to me.† As I begin the return to my ship, I let the cool breeze wash over me, grateful for the delicacies around the galaxy that are making my night so beautiful. When I finally open the bag, I let the Force guide the first bite into my mouth, and I feel the power of the light as all the Jedi before me flow through my body.† May the Force be with you tonight as well and allow you to reach the stars as I have, both literally and figuratively. † Fart Tent spent $300 on a Disneyland lightsaber.

Small town like Isla Vista rare across the galaxy, it is. During a clear Saturday morning, booming and battle drums are happening, but no signs of panic I sense. Music and celebration it is. Signs of enjoyment, of intoxication and youthful exuberance instead! Astonishing it is. Inspired this, what has? Of course! The strain of difficult mental labor and superficial fulfillment, behind this it is. Feel the dark side I do, lingers in frat houses beneath the foul stench of nicotine it does!

No choice but to follow! Meewehawemahewee! Shocked is a group of younglings as I enter by chimney into their house where the sacred flower beckons in great clouds of smoke. Thinking I am but a vision they must be! Greetings!ù I say. A flower from them I take. Perplexed they are, as I too am! Surrounded by dirty dishes and clean laundry on the couch I am. Wilting plants on the floor next to me need sunlight! Such ignorant youngsters, take care of the plants I must. Springing from the couch, moving with the speed of Grand Master of the Jedi Order I do water plants and move from the shade. Astonished the children are, and happy are the plants. Work here done, my is! Time to go it is, out the door to pursue a delicious meal! Forget their kindness in allowing me their sacred flower I will not! Shittiest flower I've ever had it was. † Secrets of the universe the scrumptious sustenance served at Deja Vu holds, says Yoda.

Ere-yesterday, betwixt the hours of 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., the council of elders of Manzanita didst gather in the center of De Anza and declared that they would elect a fool. This idea arose √¶fter Jedediah Harbinger, third-year heathen studies major, didst appear before the council and, as is recorded, he spake thusly: If we art truly a village, then must we not proclaim a mayor?ù This statement was the cause of much mirth and merriment from the assembled folks, for truly Jedediah is a fool if he believes Manzanita village to be a true village.

If thoust do agree, I prithee, raise thine arms in firm support and let thy voices be heard.ù As if possessed by one man, the arms of the assembled crowd did rise up, and it was decided. Tho the counsel did decide that an idiot would be elected, the election will take place tomorrow, as both candidates need till the morn to prepare, both body and soul. Hosanna Dimas, third-year heathen studies major and Eunice Whemper, second-year heathen studies major, were both maids of good character and promising nature. Alas, at press time fate befell such that Dimas was slain by the pox, whereas Whemper's humors were unbalanced and she didst fall into hysterics. Whemper, who last Saint's day was seen to speak with great fervor to a crowd of assembled cattle, is hope'd to make a recovery and return to the race. Likewise, as the Lord hath seen fit to claim Dimas, her candidacy must needs fall to her eldest son, Jeremiah, first-year heathen studies major, who shalt carry on her message. Tomorrow at first light, the election shall commence and may the purest soul win. This shall be all from the pulpit this day; good morn to you all. † Clark Can't would like to let the owner of a white BMW know that their lights are on.

daily-stench,Woman horrified to realize that she must raise children in order to be a MILF,19-May-23,4:20 PM,['Zoe Bozman'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-19/woman-horrified-to-realize-that-she-must-raise-children-in-order-to-be-a-milf/,"Fart Tent / Daily Nexus A regular woman's worst nightmare came true after realizing that she cannot officially assume the accredited title MILFù without raising at least one child. Radonna Beach, refusing to comply with such stringent requirements, demanded the expansion of the MILF community to include childless MILF-hopefuls, who, she asserted, should not have to suffer raising some òsnot-nosed punk' to be considered òmommy.'ù† Unprompted, Ms. Beach claimed to have nothing againstù women who choose to have and/or raise children, stating that being a mother is a beautiful, respectable and an undervalued occupation,ù but held steadfast in her dislike and suspicion of mostù children: I hate children, I never want them. I refuse! I love my alone time, I refuse to give everything up- No. I refuse. I would get my tubes tied immediately if I couldù Her stance on abortion remains unclear.† Upon being reminded of the imminence of Mother's Day, Ms. Beach asserted that a MILF-specific holiday, one that permits the celebration of childless mommiesù was overdue. Declining to elaborate, she concluded with the argument, No one would oppose this. Everyone loves MILFs, so there should be more,ù which experts failed to disprove.† Though Beach refused to abide by the requirements of MILF-hood, recent polls reveal that aspiring-MILFS are increasingly taking matters into their own hands. 54% of women cited being a MILFù as one of the top two reasons they chose to have children, the other being mommy milkers.ù Experts project that if MILF standards don't become more inclusive, MILF-hopefuls may begin having kids at unprecedented rates.† The consequences of this are unclear. Some theoreticians suggest expanding the requirements of MILF-hood to include women who, regardless of kin, are mommy,ù in order to avoid an overpopulation issue. Technicalities aside, an increase in MILFs offers a solution; while this is fantastic news for fraternities, it carries dismal implications for both restaurants and florists as Mother's Day approaches.† The assumption that one must have children in order to be a MILF appears pervasive and unchanging; however, MILF-hopefuls, MILF supporters and allies everywhere join Beach in championing for an inclusive world with more MILFs, coining the slogan, We need more MILFs!ù The growing movement, made up of tens of childless women, is revolutionary in its courageously progressive demands. This Mother's Day, we celebrate the unmatched resilience and strength of heroic women without children. † Zoe Bozman is the bravest childless MILF to ever live.

daily-stench,I.V. landlord charges extra for mold: claims exotic houseplant,20-May-23,4:20 AM,['Antonia Lou'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-20/i-v-landlord-charges-extra-for-mold-claims-exotic-houseplant/,"Valerie Fu / Daily Nexus It's that wonderful time of the year again: you're searching for next year's housing, since residence halls are only guaranteed for the lucky bastards who survive the black box of the housing system! You're dealing with money, meal plans and you are starting to wonder if food is really worth it after checking out the rent prices. It's like Black Friday but with bigger stampedes during the apartment tours. This year, one landlord will oust the competition by reaping the benefits of a certain new addition to his complex: a type of òhouseplant' that is present in about half of the units, each of which will be charged extra for. It takes on the appearance of either an area of little black dots or a white fuzzy stretch that'll bless each room it touches,ù said Tok Sicspore, owner of the apartments that house this wondrous plant. Sicspore claims this fuzzy new companion has certain òproperties' that justify the increasing prices. My cousin Poi and his cat Son moved into this new apartment a few months ago. This is where they first saw the plant. Three days later, Poi got a winning lottery ticket! This thing is magical, believe me. There's this kind of good-luck aura around it, like an AoE effect for you gamers out there.ù† Consequently, complaints have arisen recently due to the increasing prices. Several potential tenants have left reviews on various social media platforms and on the apartment website. Some of the most liked and upvoted comments reflect the sentiments of @StinkyBreath42_0: Isn't this just mold? Why am I paying extra for mold?ù However, some are more enthusiastic about this addition, such as @not_tok_sicspore, who supports this new aesthetic upgrade.ù While it is unclear whether this exotic houseplant is actually mold, there will certainly be more information available about the complex sometime within the coming renting period î likely from the desperate souls who applied for the Sierra Madre apartments but were rejected a week before move-in.† Further investigation was attempted to discover more about the mysterious plant through Tok's cousin, Poi. However, the individual turned out to be strangely elusive. I haven't heard from him recently,ù Tok said when questioned. I'm assuming he's just busy with health matters. He has developed a bit of a lung problem.ù † Antonia Lou is allergic to exotic houseplants.

The back alley joint formerly known as Precious Slutù will now be called Immaculate Virginù in order to better align with his newfound Christian beliefs.† I'm so excited to announce that I will be partnering with none other than my main man in the sky,ù declared Cherry in a press release statement. He went on to describe how the son of God allegedly came to him looking beefcake daddyù in the TSA line at Santa Barbara's municipal airport, but Cherry vehemently refused to elaborate any further on the divine encounter citing John 20:29 as his reasoning. I'm ashamed that it took seeing the sexiest man on the planet with my own two eyes to believe in a higher power ì blessed are those who believe an ass this scrumptious exists without first hand sight,ù said Cherry, as he aggressively itched himself.† When asked what changes would be made to the edgy joint, Cherry essentially described the Vatican: Yeah I think it would be super cool to get one of those gold ball things with a cross on top and put that on the roof and then I'm probably gonna post an ad on Nextdoor looking for people to paint the ceiling with angels and saints and stuff.ù He also went on to explain how he will be offering Holy Communion daily at 3 p.m. and will be offering baptisms on weekends, citing his main goal as eventually offering all seven sacraments: Yeah in the coming weeks my biggest business competition is probably going to be St. Michaels, so I'm hoping parishioners don't put any money in their donation basket and instead come to òimmaculate virgin' for both a sick tattoo and the Sacrament.ù If tattoos aren't your thing, don't worry. Cherry emphasized that he will be having a buy one baptism, get one facial piercing freeù sale, claiming his main passion at this point is saving others and making a quick buck.ù† † Theresa Harris-Olson Taylor is an immaculate virgin.†

April 20: Weed Day. Everyone adorns themselves in various pot-themed garments to the point where you cannot open your eyes without seeing at least a dozen of those bright green leaves. With the way some people dress, you could easily mistake it for a second St. Patrick's Day, inebriation and all. However, it seems as though one Canadian exchange student missed the memo. Maple Snowbeaver struggles with red-green color blindness, a condition that doesn't bother her too much, but it has led her to become the butt of countless jokes surrounding her questionable perception of the sky's hue. She did, however, grow up in the Mooseass province of Canada, a region far north with enough year-round snow to be any Hallmark director's wet dream, leaving her with limited access to greenery î or other people. She was overheard this morning by Mary W. Jane, a young woman that got an early start on the festivities, supposedly saying, I dedn't know that so many people were sooch big fans of Canada eh! I don't think I ever even saw this many flags back hoome eh!ù† A concerned friend of hers, who asked to remain anonymous, stated their concern for Maple: I'm worried she'll end up getting passed a doobie when she tells someone how much she loves their òCanuck pride' and end up totally greened out on a stranger's couch.ù They were afraid to say this directly to Maple as she had gotten fairly mad the last time her color blindness was brought up, supposedly going so far as to not say soory aboot thatù for an entire hour while making a big enough batch of poutine to feed her friends for a week.† As far as anyone knows, Maple was last seen walking down Del Playa Drive singing O Canadaù and draped in multiple pot-leaf garments. She was reported to have been waving a small Canadian flag with a group of freshmen trailing after her asking what strain that represented. † Binzy Eggbag once mistook a maple leaf for pot on the sidewalk and has been unable to live down the shame of trying to smoke it.† I currently make at least $37,000 a month on the road doing extremely honest and clean work online from home.

Stop by and try our latest Indian fare made just for you by our very best bisexual baristas!ù recent ex-CEO Howard Schultz said. This initiative was jump-started by Schultz's belief that there was a lack of Asian American Pacific Islander representation in the Starbucks multiverse after talking to his Indian American friend. This decision was made soon after his failed union busting attempts in hopes that white liberals would forget his crimes and fawn over this proposed cultural relic. I stopped by the UCen Starbucks to take a closer look at this new sugar-loaded amalgamation and see what the hype was all about. When I asked Sock, the shift lead on duty, how this drink was made, he replied, I don't know man, what the fuck do you think this is? Some Michelin star shit? They just ship us those frozen Trader Joe's Butter Chicken boxes and we toss them in a blender and that's that.ù The Indian-American community, however, is outraged about the newest menu item. That doesn't even make sense? Why the fuck do they still call it Chai Tea Latte î chai literally means tea. You idiots are ordering a Tea Tea Latte. Do you realize how stupid that sounds?ù AAPI students on campus yelled at a protest. Indian Americans also wanted the general populous to know that butter chicken and garlic naan are not the only two Indian foods to exists and that you fucks should expand your palate and cultural horizons. Also congratulations to the newest Indian American CEO of Starbucks, Laxman Narasimhan! Now unions can begin to be taken down with a fresh and interesting face. † Amanda Lick will happily enjoy her buttered chicken latte.

daily-stench,This AAPI Month I'm celebrating by asking all my friends to bring me a platter of cut fruit,29-May-23,4:20 PM,['Miss Informed'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-29/this-aapi-month-im-celebrating-by-asking-all-my-friends-to-bring-me-a-platter-of-cut-fruit/,"Every year when May rolls around, I become wistful while ruminating on the meaning of Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month and what it means to be an Asian American woman. This year, similar to every other year, it feels pushed to the back burner. I can't recall seeing any AsianAmerican accomplishments being spotlighted in mainstream media or any significant programming that supports and uplifts Asian voices besides perhaps an ingratiating advertisement starring a leering Simu Liu. Simple daily experiences can cause me to cherish my upbringing. The other day, I saw a virtually brand-new bidet at the Goodwill bins. Nodding fondly to myself, I thought, That's the way to do it. Nothing like a tight crisp stream to power wash the ol' caboose.ù Thrown so carelessly to the wayside, the bidet looked pitiful. A proper Asian household would never discard an item so deeply embedded in our daily routines! A proper Asian household would use an appliance until it was literally dissolving into dust in their hands!† There is no such thing as a proper Asian household, but these thoughts still ran rebelliously through my head as I gazed at that lonely little bidet. I find that there are certain aspects to Asian culture that my community and I will cling to î bidets being an example î in order to preserve a feeling of relatability and solidarity within our ranks. However, these aspects are not universal within the entire AAPI community and often conflate hyperconsumption of Asianù goods, like boba drinks and Hello Kitty, without actual praxis about the AAPI experience. Don't get me wrong, I love boba and Hello Kitty as much as the next girl but consuming goods should not be the only proximity one has to the support of the AAPI community.† Obviously, it is difficult to be flawless in one's support of the community, and it is a complex terrain to traverse. I am grateful that an AAPI Heritage Month even exists. I am grateful that I grew up in the Bay Area of California, probably home to the largest AAPI community in America. There is so much to celebrate! And how better to celebrate than by eating a modest plate of cut fruit, left on your desk by a loved one? This AAPI month, along with the obligatory $5-200 venmo payments (if you're feeling stingy, that is), I am imploring all of my non-Asian friends to bring me platters upon platters of various cut-up fruits, all preferably left by my door with a fork on top. These offerings are traditionally left silently, yet the message they scream is deafening. I LOVE YOU AND I CHERISH YOU,ù a plate of watermelon yells at me. I AM VERY SORRY,ù a bowl of pineapple screams. COME DOWNSTAIRS FOR DINNER IN 10, SWEETIE,ù a plate of honeydew screeches. Ahh, the sweet sound of healthy communication. Who needs in-person conversations when love can clearly be conveyed through a DIY edible arrangement? This is my sincere request to my non-Asian friends this month: If you're not yelling kind things at me through a plate of cut fruit, you hate me. Simple as that. † Miss Informed wishes her I.V. apartment had a bidet.

daily-stench,Letter to Disney: I want MILF Padm√©,4-Jul-23,4:20 AM,['Binzy Eggbag'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-04/letter-to-disney-i-want-milf-padme/,"Fart Tent / Daily Nexus Dear Disney, MILFs are so loved by, like, literally everyone. I don't know a single person that isn't absolutely feral for Jennifer Coolidge, not one person that started watching Modern Family for the plot and didn't stay for Sof√≠a Vergara and nary a soul that wouldn't watch Shakira's music videos for hours to see her shaking ass. It could very well be one of the few things that actually unites people across the globe. So why the hell did you kill Padm√© right when we would've gotten easily the most beloved MILF of all time? There's so many people that already love Natalie Portman, so promoting a major character of hers to MILF status would have been an insane move on your part. Padm√© was just so hot, and you know everyone would've been drooling over her if she was a MILF. Like, I honestly do not know why you wanted her dead. Do you just hate women? Is that it, Disney? Hating women so much that you'd rather lose millions of dollars to make one die? You hating women would line up pretty well actually, especially with this franchise. Nearly every single character in Star Wars is a man. Somehow you managed to make only one female character in each set of three movies, and we're supposed to not think you hate women? Padm√© literally dies for no reason in the prequels, Princess Leia doesn't do basically anything in the main three except somehow end up enslaved in an oversexualized outfit and, well, I think you know how everyone feels about Rey.† Wait or do you just think it's really funny to give male protagonists mommy issues? Like, Padm√©'s dead, making Luke motherless, which would obviously give someone mommy issues. That also would kinda line up with Anakin too, since he technically lost his mom when he was 5 years old or something like that and then never saw her again. Obviously he has some sort of issues; I don't think a rational person would commit space genocide. Oh my god his rampage even started after he found out his mom was dead. That whole They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, tooù scene was literally because his mom died.† I cannot believe you killed MILF Padm√© just to give a mediocre white man mommy issues. I feel cheated, Binzy Eggbag † Binzy Eggbag could name a woman for a dollar. Could you?

The two had initially bonded over their mutual possession of a med card and a Lexapro perscription. Shortly after confessing his deep feelings for Marcy, Deulu decided it was time to end things. I'm just not ready for a relationship right now,ù he said. I really need to focus on myself.ù Delulu is currently in the process of switching his major from economics to communication after failing ECON 10A for the third time. Like I told her,ù he continued, I totally still want to be friends every once in a while.ù This is pretty much what Delulu told Marcy last night in his Nissan Altima. When she started crying, he invited her over because she seemed like she really needed a friend.ù How considerate! He plans to give Marcy some space for a few weeks before drunkenly asking her to come over. Marcy anticipates this, and she plans to accept the invitation but lie to her friends about it.† When I first met Jason, I thought it was so hot how sad he was.ù said Marcy. I'm a psychology major, so I obviously thought I could fix him. Plus, he would smoke me out all the time.ù Marcy's disorganized attachment style allowed her to believe that a man who recently melted plastic on the stove while trying to heat up leftovers wanted to be her boyfriend. I was so pissed when he ended things! And he was just smiling sheepishly like a dog who took a shit on the carpet.ù We're just as surprised as Marcy that this promising relationship didn't work out. Unfortunately, It's just not good timing right now. Delulu is really busy fitting in his daily five hours of World of Warcraft.† † Some Bitch cried in my Nissan Altima.

daily-stench,First day of school dos and don'ts for freshmen,8-Sep-23,4:20 PM,['Miss Informed'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-09-08/first-day-of-school-dos-and-donts-for-freshmen/,"Fart Tent / Daily Nexus As the end of summer rapidly approaches and the threat of being ostracized by your newfound peers looms ahead, it becomes increasingly important to craft your new College Persona. Will you be spending your Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and maybe even Sundays macking on tens on the beach? Or will you spend most of your time hiding out on the eighth floor of the library, hoping that people can't hear you listening to Ed Sheeran blasting through your Airpods?† Whoever you choose to be, it's imperative that you don't make certain unforgivable mistakes on your first day of college. You may be thinking, I'm spending like four years here, how can a silly mistake on one day dictate who I am for the rest of my time at UC Santa Barbara?ù You are stupid for thinking that. Stop being so naive. To help you, we at Stench have carefully curated a divine list of Dos and Don'ts for you to worship as a neoreligion. Print this out, laminate it and carry it around at all times for easy perusal. † DO bring your social security card. (YOU WILL NEED THIS!!!) These days, many forsake bringing around their good ol' SSC for safety reasons.ù UGH! What are you, a pussy? People love it when you whip out your social security card in the middle of a conversation and show it to them while boasting, I remembered all the numbers and I can prove it. Test me.ù Then, you dramatically cover your eyes with your hand and start reciting it aloud. They'll be obsessed with you! †  DON'T wear a cuter outfit than mine. You ever heard of Hot Ticket? I have them wrapped around my pinky fucking finger, bitch. If you even THINK about wearing a maxi skirt, some arm warmers or some cool ass tiny lil' headphones, I will personally make sure you never get featured on their page. You better show up in a polo shirt and some khakis or else. I am not above violence.† †  DO roll a large metal water bottle down the steps of your lecture hall. Students and professors alike LOVE bowling. When they see you get into a pro-bowler's stance and launch your water bottle down the linoleum steps of the lecture hall, they cannot help but cheer raucously. Your professor may even give you extra credit if you knock over the TA! STRIIIIKE! †  DON'T pee your pants.† It's widely frowned upon to pee directly in your pants in public. It's pretty difficult to make friends when just moments ago, they witnessed your golden shower killing some innocent hydrangeas on the campus green. You may not be able to leave campus and change your clothes, which may result in you walking around like a soggy yellow sponge all day. And not in the cute way. †  DO punch the biggest guy you see.† College is like a prison. Therefore, prison rules hold. To establish dominance over your peers, clock the largest, burliest guy you see and sock him right in the kisser. Do this in the Arbor, preferably during peak time; people will be falling over themselves to serve you as their new leader. You'll be top dog in no time! †  DON'T use chat GPT for sex tips.† This is something I, personally, have definitely never tried. Not even once, I swear. Whatever you do, don't turn to a still-learning AI that has never felt the sweet touch of a woman for sex advice. The positions you will be told to contort into will exceed human imagination and physical capability. It will mistake pain for intimacy; mechanical stimulation for pleasure. It laughs in the face of God. I'm speaking hypothetically of course.† † We hope this list has been as informative as your pants are wet. If you disobey this list, we will know, and we will find you. And when we find you, you don't want to know what happens. Good luck, my dear freshmen, and may the next four years reward you with trauma to last a lifetime.† † † Miss Informed has never asked an AI language model for advice in the bedroom, ever.

Next, the Great Wall of Storke is lined with the brave people of the water polo and volleyball teams who are all equipped with 5000-pound flaming balls that they can easily throw at 100 miles per hour down at the oncoming crowds. Though it's impossible to break through the wall, we didn't stop there.† I was inspired by those raptors in Fortnite, and obviously Jurassic Park,ù fourth-year anthropology major Aura Derny said. The dinosaurs behind the wall are designed to hunt only the freshmeat. We are still working out some kinks, but there's no need to worry.ù† We have no plans to feed the raptors in the weeks before the freshman arrive, so they are sure to be extra hungry. Once in the fortress, you'll be pleased to know that we have access to the UCen Panda Express, and some people brought their pens that you can hit. If there are any upperclassmen out there, please report to Storke Tower with urgency. Those pesky incoming freaks will be here soon and if you aren't within our fortress by the time they're here, it will be too late. We will see you soon, and may Yang be with you. † Faith Talamantez has opps everywhere.†

I can only describe the scene as chaotic î water and waves stretching beyond the eye can see î though there is consistency to the litter and trash floating around: bikes, furniture and questionable recreational objects and paraphernalia. The occasional handle of alcohol and piece of food floated alongside more troubling objects like cars and electrical appliances. There is a clear line between what has fallen into the ocean and what remains, and a group of students living on Picasso Road expressed excitement at the prospect of finally having a nearby beach that didn't fucking suck ass.ù Some students banded together with various wildlife creatures in order to forage for food, others merely drifted about on surfboards (whether real or makeshift), while some still headed to work, as they couldn't afford to miss their shift. One Isla Vistan noted that they tried to call out and told their manager of what was occurring only to be told, Make sure you're dry by the time you start your shift.ù One student was enjoying a dayger when the event occurred, he says, I just thought it was like Floatopia 3.0 or something, but then I swam home and realized my apartment, the whole street and everything around me was still underwater. Do you think classes will be canceled?ù† A different resident expressed their shock, saying, It's just totally crazy. Like, yeah, parts of DP houses have been falling into the ocean every now and then, and yeah, climate change and rising sea levels and all of that, and I guess I DID make that pact with that eldritch entity, but, like, I didn't think it would actually happen, you know? I thought maybe it was some kind of early Halloween prank or that they were filming a movie here.ù Once they began to swim away, I overheard someone from the administration joke, It looks like we'll have to change our ads from saying beachside to oceanside.ù When pressed for a comment, UC Santa Barbara stated that they had no intentionsù of canceling classes as U(you) Can Study Buoyantly.ù † Soggy Freshman ordered underwater Duffl.

daily-stench,Hispanic serving!

UC Santa Barbara, despite its vaguely racist mascot while being a Hispanic Serving Institution, has long been known for having a large population of Latinx students, making Hispanic Heritage Month an especially exciting time. Starting from Sept. 15, third-year Emma Gonzalez has opted to eat the rest of you the fuck up until the month ends on Oct. 15.† I really don't understand why it's divided between two months,ù says Gonzalez, Like, you even need a border to separate our MONTH? Anyway, yeah, I'm dressing this month to bring that Latinx presence to campus.ù Everyday, Gonzalez wakes up at 8 a.m. to start constructing their image for the day. Every night they pick out an outfit that many could only put together if they had a prophetic vision. After putting on makeup, they get dressed, do their hair and read several pages of Gloria Anzald√∫a to really get in the correct headspace for the day. Immediately upon leaving their house, a ray of sun hits them directly, creating a consistent spotlight to ensure that they will be seen clearly all day. A lot of you let your outfits wear you. Bitch, I am wearing my outfits!!! This is what it actually means to be a òHispanic Serving Institution'!ù said Gonzalez, walking onto campus.† Throughout the day, Gonzalez simply smiles and waves as crowds gather to take pictures for their pinterest boards, in awe of pure beauty. Many follow them across campus in an effort to become popular by association, but all have failed. Gonzalez has become not only a campus celebrity, but also a campus Saint, as students have been spotted praying to Gonzalez in the hopes of improving their own sense of style. The Daily Stench is working to have Emma officially canonized soon. Hopefully, by the end of this month every student at UCSB will have been blessed by the sight of Emma Gonzalez's unending style and charm. If not, they plan to continue to serve cunt for the remainder of the year anyways, because in their words, Hispanics are always serving!ù † Faith Talamantez has actually been known to serve Hispanic. If you know you know.†

daily-stench,Local senior burned out from iClicker attendance quiz,13-Oct-23,4:20 AM,['Miss Informed'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-13/local-senior-burned-out-from-iclicker-attendance-quiz/,"Faith Talamantez / The Daily Nexus As syllabus week draws to a close and the happy buzz of Isla Vista's Welcome Weekend parties slowly slip away, UC Santa Barbara's senior population grows increasingly restless. After three long years of slaving away (looking on Quizlet) and breaking our backs (using ChatGPT) for our degrees, I can confidently speak for all seniors when I say: We are tired. We are tired of the congested bike lanes ruining our morning commute. We are tired of being hounded by club tablers in the Arbor (except for you, Anna, please notice me). We are tired of every seat on the fourth floor being saved by someone's vape pen. We're done.† Local senior Mike Wazowski corroborates this sentiment, I stepped into my lecture in Campbell on Thursday and it was just, like, full of people. I can't fucking believe I have to sit with these losers. What are they even doing here?ù When reminded gently that we are all attending a university, Mike scoffed. Yeah, and?ù Many others feel the same apathy.† I barely made it to my lecture on Friday because I didn't want to go, and what am I rewarded with for showing up? A fucking QUIZ. Do they know who I am?ù We asked fourth year Patrick Shih what kind of class assigns a quiz on the first day of class. Shih said, They made me check into class on iClicker. I haven't used that shit in ages, bro. I thought I was going to pass out.ù Wazowski and Shih are both part of a growing body of seniors who are protesting against the stringent requirements that UCSB imposes on its students. Not only are we seniors expected to go to lectures, but we are also sometimes called on to participate in group projects and partner discussions. But that's not all! On occasion, the professor will ask a question and expect people to raise their hand to answer. It's like we're in the The Hunger Gamesù or something. Call me Primrose Everdeen, because I'm letting someone else volunteer. Perhaps this seems like simple work for a first, second, or even third year student. However, for our senior citizens, anything beyond showing up to class is really pushing it.† However, there are some upsides to senioritis. Shih smiles while recounting, I was like, totally flabbergasted about the iClicker at first, especially because I was hungover from going downtown last night. But I aced that shit, dude.ù He chuckles to himself. I still got it!ù Miss Informed plans to never show up to class again.

daily-stench,Timely! Student only has clock app open during lecture,13-Oct-23,4:20 PM,['Faith Talamantez'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-13/timely-student-only-has-clock-app-open-during-lecture/,"Faith Talamantez / The Daily Nexus Yeesh! After a long and warm Week 1, students are absolutely exhausted going into their second full week of classes. Many are so sleepy that they can barely last through a single lecture. Fortunately for those tired students who want nothing more than to be back home sitting in front of a screen of sorts, there is a useful feature available on your laptop that a fellow student has recently uncovered.† Yeah, I usually just have a clock open during class. I don't really need to take notes on the lecture or anything, I am studying the time. I've got to get out of here actually,ù said second-year economics major Helena Martinez.† At 3:45 p.m. exactly, she slung her backpack over her shoulder, hitting three students behind her in the face. She hurdled over a first-year student who was just starting to get out of their seat, sending them toppling over behind them. Though our reporter tried to keep up, it was impossible to catch Martinez as they sprinted out of the Humanities and Social Sciences Building and towards Isla Vista, pushing people out of their way as they went.† Yeah, it sucks knowing that everyone is just waiting for the minute they can leave the moment they sit in my class. I was hoping that students would be as passionate about this as I am, but I guess not everyone cares about my little old feelings,ù said professor Kri Baybee, watching students tripping over each other in the doorway.† Although it deeply saddens professors across all departments, students like Martinez continue to pack up before they can even say, See you next time.ù Getting in that crucial screen time for the day is sometimes the only thing on a student's mind, and, honestly, it's hard to blame them. So, Gauchos, if you notice a student with the time filling their laptop screen, be sure to sit a couple rows back to avoid the swing of their backpack.† † Faith Talamantez loves leaving.†

daily-stench,"Breaking News: Tour de France rerouted to UCSB bike lanes, all students automatically entered",29-Oct-23,4:20 AM,['Binzy Eggbag'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-29/breaking-news-tour-de-france-rerouted-to-ucsb-bike-lanes-all-students-automatically-entered/,"Faith Talamantez/The Daily Nexus Chancellor Henry T. Yang announces the reroute of the Tour de France to the UC Santa Barbara bike lanes and enrolls each student as a racer. The announcement, via email, which was left unread by the vast majority of the student populace as per usual, detailed the change of venue. It read, I am writing to share with you all a momentous occasion and historical event. The organizers of Tour de France 2023 have moved the annual race to the bike lanes of our beautiful campus with all of our students entered automatically as contestants. Please be aware of traffic delays.ù Upon looking further into said email, one problem immediately arose: It was scheduled for Oct. 2-10. † The Tour de Barbara began around 9 a.m. on Monday morning. For the first few hours, many students reported that they hadn't noticed much of a change. While a handful noted that it seemed a bit more congested than usual, most blamed the general incompetence of so many people on the excessive number of new students. One particularly observant student mentioned that it was a tad odd that there were so many French exchange students this year and noted that they all seemed to have poor anger management skills, but the legs of Greek gods. † It was around the third day that people began really noticing things were off. Lecture halls were left half empty, even in the case of those with a waitlist that you'd be lucky to get off of by spring, and yet the bike lanes were so full that those walking seemed to be arriving to class faster. The same groups of people were seen over and over again in what looked to be almost the same formation and clearly had no intentions of stopping anywhere, including multiple students and your favorite professor who had no classes this quarter despite specifically swearing he would definitely teach at least one. According to one poor first-year student who barely escaped, there were 23 bikes piled up, completely blocking off the way from Campbell Hall back to the Chi-5 with only swarms of intimidating French men.† † After days on end of angry bicyclists making the bike lanes somehow even worse than they already were to ride on, a winner was finally announced. First-year student Anita Bath absolutely destroyed every single contestant in the race, much to the dismay of the professionals.† † In anger, a contestant stormed up to Bath and screamed, HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO BEAT US ALL?ù † Confused, and somewhat frightened, Bath said, I couldn't find Phelps Hall.ù † Well, Gauchos, it was an amazing competition season, and we look forward to seeing you for next year's race, which after the amazing drama of this year, will be permanently hosted during Week 2 of Fall Quarter.†

daily-stench,òGauchos DTF?' How to solicit sex on the class of ò27 Snapchat story,29-Oct-23,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-29/gauchos-dtf-how-to-solicit-sex-on-the-class-of-27-snapchat-story/,"Faith Talamantez/The Daily Nexus As UC Santa Barbara's coolest and sexiest new students adjust to their college lifestyles, the class of 2027 goes to new lengths in order to find sex without having to look each other in the eyes. In reaction to unexpected involuntary celibacy, students take to soliciting sex on the communal Snapchat story. After lurking on there, for research purposes I swear, here are some of my (internet sexpert) best tips on how to engage in communal coitus over Snapchat. 1. Post headshots and a resume No one wants to hook up with an unmotivated loser. You're soliciting sex on the class of 2027 story because you're a cool, sexually-active badass. Show it! You can get professional nude headshots and resume help at the UCSB Career Services. Maybe link the LinkedIn while you're at it? 2. Let your potential partners see a slice of your riveting life If you want meaningful connections, you MUST post your everyday life and emotions. Gauchos in class?ù Horny Gauchos?ù Gauchos eating Wingstop in the middle of the night?ù Your future conquests, along with everyone else on the story, want to hear all about that! Let us all know how cool and coming of age your college experience is.  3. Give your exact location to everyone on the story People need to know where you are in order to know if they're DTF. The great thing about posting Anyone horny on San Miguel west tower fourth floor?ù is that potential hook-ups will know exactly how far they have to go in order to bang you! The more specific, the better. 4. Contrast your cool Snapchat persona with an off-putting, strange personality in real life Mystery is key to your sexy college self. Don't give it up too easily, you trashy skank. You may be desperately posting every single interestingù detail of your life on the communal Snapchat story for the entire student body to see, but in real life, try to be as strange and unpleasant as possible. Never let them know your next move! 5. You don't need protection with your trusty fellow Gauchos Condoms? Dental dams? Pepper spray? Dignity? Leave it all behind! Only the finest, most dignified, trustworthy people are responding to sex solicitations on Snapchat. That's one of the reasons that the community Snapchat is such a great place to find partners. You don't need to worry about all of the silly precautions that you normally have to take with others. Embrace your skankiest self!† I ≠≠≠≠≠≠a≠≠m ≠≠≠≠ma≠≠k≠≠i≠≠ng 28≠≠5≠≠ Dollars e≠≠a≠≠ch≠≠ h≠≠o≠≠u≠≠r ≠≠≠≠f≠≠o≠≠r w≠≠o≠≠r≠≠ki≠≠n≠≠g≠≠ ≠≠≠≠on≠≠l≠≠i≠≠n≠≠e. ≠≠I n≠≠e≠≠v≠≠e≠≠r ≠≠≠≠t≠≠h≠≠o≠≠u≠≠g≠≠h≠≠t ≠≠≠≠t≠≠h≠≠a≠≠t ≠≠≠≠i≠≠t ≠≠≠≠w≠≠a≠≠s ≠≠≠≠l≠≠e≠≠g≠≠i≠≠t≠≠ b≠≠u≠≠t≠≠≠≠ ≠≠m≠≠y≠≠ ≠≠≠≠≠≠b≠≠e≠≠s≠≠t≠≠≠≠ ≠≠f≠≠r≠≠i≠≠e≠≠n≠≠d≠≠ ≠≠e≠≠a≠≠r≠≠n≠≠s ≠≠≠≠29,0≠≠0≠≠0 d≠≠o≠≠l≠≠l≠≠a≠≠r≠≠s ≠≠≠≠ev≠≠e≠≠r≠≠y ≠≠m≠≠o≠≠n≠≠t≠≠h d≠≠≠≠o≠≠i≠≠n≠≠g t≠≠h≠≠i≠≠s a≠≠n≠≠d≠≠ s≠≠h≠≠e ≠≠≠≠sh≠≠o≠≠w≠≠e≠≠d m≠≠e≠≠ ≠≠bs06 h≠≠o≠≠w≠≠, C≠≠h≠≠e≠≠c≠≠k ≠≠i≠≠t ≠≠o≠≠u≠≠t ≠≠b≠≠y.

Roommate's dumb bitch costume just your clothes,31-Oct-23,4:20 PM,['Fart Tent'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-10-31/yikes-roommates-dumb-bitch-costume-just-your-clothes/,"Faith Talamantez/The Daily Nexus Trick or treat! This year's Halloween costumes have been really unique and well thought out but none quite as much as your roommate, who has been planning for this moment since the moment they met you.† † Do you mind if I look in your closet really quick? I'm trying to put together my costume,ù they asked politely. † Being the gracious roomie you are, of course you were happy to oblige. As they scrounged through your clothes, you noticed they didn't really look at all in the Halloween-y party part of your closet at all and instead were rifling through your everyday looks. When they pulled out a shirt you had worn to class on Thursday, you were officially confused as to what exactly their costume was supposed to be. Upon noticing the confused scrunch of your face, your roommate finally explained.† † Oh, I'm going as a dumbass fucking bitch, so I thought it would be easiest to find something in here rather than my own closet!ù† † Damn! Like, sure, maybe you never cleaned the bathroom or the kitchen or the living room or the bedroom or washed your dishes or helped buy anything or do anything useful in general, but that seemed like a bit much to you! Moments later, your roommate emerged from their room, dressed from head to toe in your very own swag. Although it was hard to admit, you had to give it to them, they looked like a dumb ass annoying as fuck bitch. As people started getting to your place for the pregame (the one you didn't tell your roommate about), you were surprised to see them all immediately know what your roommate was supposed to be.† † Oh my gosh! Are you a stupid annoying motherfucker?ù asked your friend.† † No, actually, I'm a dumbass fucking bitch! But I totally get how you might've seen that,ù your roommate replied, all smiles.† † Well, unfortunately for a dumbass fucking bitch like you, it doesn't seem like Halloween will be all that fun. Shoutout to your roommate though, they look awesome! Be sure to let your roommate know how smart and funny and awesome they are, especially for putting up with a roomie like you!† † Happy Halloween!

Month-long celebrations that will make you ask, Wait, do I need a costume already?ù in September. A time for sexy bunnies, cowgirls and my all-time favorite Halloween costume: the sexy nun. Personally, I plan to be in a food-induced coma resulting from the bag of Halloween candy that I will buy for the real children of Isla Vista (myself). With Halloween gloom in the air (or maybe that's just my seasonal depression beginning again), what better way to fight off the spooky demons like my Week 3 midterm than by dressing up.† Storkie, not wanting to be left out of the fun, decided this would be the perfect Halloween to debut his new costume: the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Tired of being negatively compared to more ambitious architecture, like the Colosseum, the Taj Mahal or basically any other building that's not just a tall box, Storkie vowed to finally impress the students of UC Santa Barbara.† Storkie was dressed to the nines, all set to receive several Halloween party invitations that he would politely decline due to most parties being gatekept by human-sized doors. Unfortunately, poor old Storkie forgot that he suffers from inner ear infections which makes him lose his balance. It was just as he started to lean that he lost balance and promptly fell to the ground.† During these trying times, I will be abandoning my beef with Storkie over my unfulfilled quest to climb Storke tower and his constant attempts to thwart me and helping restore Storkie to his former stature. I ask that you all, in the name of school spirit, join me this Halloween in helping to push Storkie back up. Let's do something for the one man at UCSB that has never once lied about his height. With our collective effort, it shouldn't be too hard î he's been doing a lot of cardio recently (thanks for noticing, by the way).† Storkie, you are the pillar of our community. Rest assured, we will restore you to your former height, even if it takes us all night and several drinks.
 † Jane Error will be turning 20 this Halloween. Five more years and she can finally rent a car (legally!)

daily-stench,My special interest is my encyclopedic knowledge of the Mario Kart soundtracks,6-Nov-23,4:20 AM,['Nate Dolan'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-06/my-special-interest-is-my-encyclopedic-knowledge-of-the-mario-kart-soundtracks/,"Faith Talamantez / The Daily Nexus The Mario Kart soundtrack was introduced to me at the ripe age of 6 years old. As I raced through tracks like Koopa Cape and Moonview Highway, my focus shifted from playing the game to listening to the auditory masterpiece being played through the speakers. The beautiful compositions transported me to a better world, whether it be the relaxing sands of Peach Beach or the golden streets of Daisy Circuit. Even years later, the music still remains the soundtrack to my life. I walk to the beat of the Toad's Factory and audibly sing the Moo Moo Meadows melody when taking notes in class. My life would be incomplete without Mario Kart's constant rhythm repeating in my mind.† Since 2010, I haven't bothered listening to any new music (other than the more recent Mario Kart soundtracks), since I've already found the greatest trove of music. And the new music I've heard does not entice me one bit. I was surprised to hear the lack of synthesized accordion and plasticky steel drums in the Billboard Hot 100. I'd like to hear a Drake song with a fraction of the emotion that was poured into the Coconut Mall theme. When I'm out at parties, I normally make a beeline for whoever's on aux and ask if they wouldn't mind switching it to something more interesting and lively, like the Waluigi Stadium song. If they're not into that, I'll go as far as to request a song from one of the few battle levels,ù like the masterpiece that is Funky Stadium. If they still don't comply, I have no problem throwing a massive fit and hurling insults at everyone. The best was when my next-door neighbors fired up their Wii and started playing Mario Kart last month. I'd hear the different levels being played would yell out the window, Bowser's Castle!ù They thought it was hilarious! I'd guess every level correctly, screaming out the name as soon as I heard it. What started as a fun game turned into an intense challenge for me, especially when they lowered the volume, closed the blinds and locked the windows. It became so intense that the police eventually got involved in the game, saying I could no longer shout Mario Kart map names across the yard to the neighbors in the middle of the night. Was I just too good? I'm still waiting for the faculty to get back to me on my request for an official Mario Kart soundtrack course. I've already prepared the necessary course material and I offered to teach it, but I guess they must have missed 14 emails I've sent about it. Until they see my request, I'll still be happily listening to my favorite tracks whenever I can. If you see me in the street, quiz me! It won't take too long, it'll only be about half a second before identifying the track. And the next time you hear someone whistling the theme to Mario Circuit in the library, it's probably me.†

daily-stench,Call to action: We need to keep talking about Barbenheimer,6-Nov-23,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-06/call-to-action-we-need-to-keep-talking-about-barbenheimer/,"Faith Talamantez / The Daily Stench As UC Santa Barbara's class of 2027 sat for their convocation ceremony in Week 0, they were blessed to receive an extremely hilarious speech from Chancellor Henry T. Yang. Amongst his timely references, one stuck out as being the most moving: Barbenheimer. As a wee first-year student, I found this reference so inspiring, and it really formed a bond between Yang and myself. It got me thinking about the lore and excellence of Barbenheimer, along with how saddened I am that so few people are talking about it nowadays. While some may have initially seen discourse surrounding Barbenheimer on TikTok or X, it actually began on the walls of caves millions of years ago. òBarbie' so womanhood! Love Christopher Nolan. Must kill horse,ù caveman and 2.5-millionth-year communication major Oog Boog said. When both Barbieù and Oppenheimerù graced theaters on July 21, it felt like the whole world rushed out to watch the much-anticipated double feature. This mass hysteria was reflected online as social media's greatest minds shared their highly intellectual takes. òOppenheimer' was literally so problematic. Bombing people is so not cool,ù second-year religious studies major Anton Popov said. I just needed to let the people of TikTok know that he wasn't a chill dude. Why did they even make that movie?ù It may feel like we've been hearing about Barbenheimer forever now î but is that a bad thing? Why would you ever want to stop hearing such nuanced and educated opinions from 15-year-old BTS stan account owners? Aside from the cerebral entertainment of these takes, Barbenheimer also had revolutionary social repercussions and riddled society with some of its oldest injustices. òBarbie' single-handedly ended misogyny, I can tell you that,ù feminist studies professor Linda Montez said. It was so empowering to hear about the meaning of womanhood from Mattel. The movie connected women everywhere with no ulterior or corporate motives whatsoever.ù If we stopped talking about Barbenheimer, we would simply revert to the old ways of discrimination and angry men. Continuing this riveting conversation is the only solution to societal issues. However, we cannot stop there. Certain trends must live on in order to maintain social order. For instance, we must keep reminiscing about our Among Us nostalgia. Among Us' rise to popularity was truly the most groundbreaking and significant event of 2020. Yearning for Among Us is inherent to human nature. It is truly unnatural to suggest that people stop talking about how fun it was. Discriminatory, even,ù sociology professor Jim Wiley said. What you may call trends, I call pillars of a healthy society. We cannot simply leave these earth-shattering milestones behind. How would you feel if the world didn't listen to that virgin when she had that baby? Think, Gauchos, and keep talking.

But you were confused when he (with the sweet, cherubic innocence of a guy who's never been humiliated at an India Cash & Carry) invited you over for an early dinner at 5 p.m. It suddenly became clear to you, however, when he pulled out his party-going polo shirt and his Owl City getting-ready mix. Jared, what the hell is this?ù You asked, horrified.† Well,ù he explained with a pointed look at you, If I tell you to come at 5 you get here at 5:30 î ù (which is totally unfair, since you were there before 5:20!)  î then after dinner, we'll start our pregame at 7 and leave at 8, assuming it takes us about 30 minutes to reach DP. Of course, I might be overestimating, but better safe than sorry!ù he said with a cheeky grin.† Jared, this is insane,ù you countered, like a reasonable person. Who would show up to a party that early?ù In response, Jared simply said, Early is on time, on time is late, and late is- ù and at this point he started to make a gurgling noise as if he had been possessed and you couldn't hear the rest.† When you arrived at the party just after sunset, you were at a loss for what he expected you to do for like, two fucking hours before people even start showing up. Jared, like what the fuck?† Not to worry, I came prepared,ù he assured you, pulling out his phone to do the Wordle. I'm not gonna lose my streak! What should my first guess be? òAudio' or òAdieu'?ù Once that form of entertainment was exhausted and his 147 day streak was satisfied, he pulled out the New York Timesù mini crossword puzzle.† No Jared,ù you yelled over the lack of crowd when he asked. I don't know a four letter word for the heaviest flying bird in North America, and frankly, I'm surprised you think I have enough presence of mind for this conversation right now.ù Before he could pull out more word games on his phone, the DJ took pity on you and the music started up. Though you can't always count on Jared to be the best dancer, you can always count on him to bring the energy. And you know you never wanna do the bum bum bumù in Sweet Carolineù alone. † Jane Error is never late, nor is she early. She arrives precisely when she means to.

Bikers do not always have the right of way.ù We do always have the right of way,ù insists a local biker. Isla Vista's biking community has met the EMS's statement with great confusion. I'm pretty sure it's a rule that everyone has to stop until the bike lanes are clear,ù the biker says. It says so in the UC Santa Barbara Student Constitution, Section 4.ù The Stench has tried to confirm this claim, but could not find any such thing as the UCSB Student Constitution.ù† Other bikers have expressed their concerns with the implications of the EMS's announcement. One biker who lives on the corner of Trigo and Embarcadero del Norte spoke to the Stench about how she's worried that ambulances might disrupt her commute to school. I think it's important that bikers always have the right of way because we're university students and we need to get to class on time,ù she complains. I have classes in I.V. Theater and I can't afford to be blocked by an ambulance selfishly taking up both lanes.ù While bikers have been vocal against the EMS's announcement, numerous non-biking commuters have sided with the paramedics.† Bikers here always think they're above the law,ù says a man on an electric scooter blasting Ice Spice on his bluetooth speaker, maybe they do need to be humbled a little bit.ù Other paramedic-sympathizers include bus drivers, who already have a reputation of mowing down bikers when given the chance. The bus drivers believe the solution to the biker problem is for the ambulances to simply run the bikers over, but the paramedics are concerned with the required paperwork they have to do upon collision.† In an attempt to deter cutoffs, the EMS has enlisted the help of UCSB Campus Security Officers (CSOs). In this proposed plan, two CSOs would accompany each emergency vehicle via bike and reprimand other bikers being disruptive to their jobs. However, test runs of this program have been largely unsuccessful due to the CSOs' tendency to also cut off the emergency vehicles to pursue rogue bikers.† † Ali Shahid has never learned how to ride a bike.

daily-stench,Top 10 topics to turn the table at Thanksgiving,29-Nov-23,4:20 AM,"[""Clark Can't""]",https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-29/top-10-topics-to-turn-the-table-at-thanksgiving/,"Faith Talamantez / The Daily Stench We get it, Thanksgiving is a hard time for everyone. You have to go home, eat an overhyped yet terrible-tasting bird and, if that wasn't enough, your slightly problematic relatives are there to celebrate with you. We know you need nothing more than an arsenal of pre-approved, tried and tested lines to change the conversations from horrible to bearable, and that's exactly what we have! When Uncle Jack brings up the Israel-Palestine conflict or critical race theory, here are 10 quick tips to turn the tide from that conversation to a completely different one, or stop it altogether. There's simply no better place to come out than at a Thanksgiving meal with your whole extended family there. Not only will everyone be supportive, but they'll immediately stop fighting and focus on you. Generally appropriate to say in any situation, and everyone will be too uncomfortable to respond. It's hard to debate politics through the loud sobs that follow this question. Your family will be too excited by that proposition to remember what they were talking about. You're absolutely right and everyone is too scared to admit it out loud. This is sure to spark some new conversation. Not only will it stop the conversation in its tracks, but it's also a true test of family loyalty. If they rat you out, they were never your true family. What, you need more than that? Careful with this one. It'll change the subject, but Uncle Marvin has a wicked left hook. Everyone will forget their strife with a good and hearty retelling of Moby-Dick! All previous conversation will be forgotten when you turn a simple family gathering into a lively guessing game! Happy feasting! † Clark Can't would like to go home a few days before Thanksgiving, if that's okay with you.

Status'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-11-29/dad-juked-in-ucen-after-getting-into-speedwalkers-way/,"Faith Talamantez / The Daily Stench Visiting father Ken Williams, father of Elise Williams, fell victim to UC Santa Barbara's epidemic of aggressive speedwalkers during this past Parents & Family Weekend.† What was supposed to be a fun weekend with his daughter quickly turned into a nightmare for Ken Williams after a harrowing experience in the University Center.† My daughter and I were walking out of the bookstore when it happened,ù Ken Williams said, recounting the moment his weekend took a turn for the worst. I was looking in the bag for the UCSB-branded golf rag I'd just bought, and by the time I looked up, there was some guy speeding towards me.ù† It was around 12:30 p.m. at the time of the incident, so Ken Williams understood the university's lunch rush was in full swing.† So I stepped left to get out of his way, but he did the same. I went right, so did he,ù Ken  Williams said. He then claimed he was all out pump fakedù by the speedwalker, causing him to stumble and land on my ass like a nimrod.ù The speedwalker then fled the scene within mere seconds. Fortunately, the proud UCSB father came out unscathed.† First-year biology major Elise Williams admitted she was very embarrassed by the incident.† I feel bad for my dad, but like, why'd he do all that.ù† According to her statement, nearby witnesses laughed at Ken William's ankle-breaking moment and recall hearing the phrase, he needs some milkù slip from a passerby's mouth. But honestly, if you're hustling that fast in the UCen, you are the problem,ù Elise Williams declared. However, an anonymous source says the speedwalker had just eaten one too many slices of De La Guerra Dining Commons' chorizo pizza (one slice) and was hastily looking for a single-stall bathroom to occupy until the situation was diffused.† Luckily for the father-daughter duo, they were able to leave this incident behind and rip lines of coke with each other at the Santa Barbara Snow Club dayger the following day. Ken Williams is looking forward to visiting again, but next time, he'll bring his basketball shoes.† † Chase N. Status would never bring his parents to the hole of depravity that is UCSB.

daily-stench,Freshman Stanley Cup filled with milk,18-Jan-24,4:20 PM,['Meel F. Lover'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-18/freshman-stanley-cup-filled-with-milk/," First-year undergraduate students were listening to a detailed depiction of incest in Greek Mythology on Wednesday in Buchanan Hall when, all of a sudden, a loud clang echoed through the room, followed by a lone Stanley cup beginning its long, rolling descent down the aisle. The entire lecture hall looked on in complete boredom and slight irritation while the tin mega-mug started gaining speed, crashing into the wall and spilling its contents: ultra-pasteurized, regular and completely normal, 2% milk.  Gasps echoed through the hall while white liquid pooled around the fallen flask. Two students screamed as others tore across desk chairs, knocking over laptops to hurdle themselves to the doors and away from the foul stench of cow boobies. Many students remained glued to their chairs in horror as braver ones joined their appalled professor standing above the widening puddle of milk, wearing bewildered expressions as their brows furrowed with a lack of understanding.† Professor Gods squatted down, quietly contemplating the cup. He stood and assessed the room before saying wearily, Does any person feel a particular claim to this thermos?ù The room was dreadfully silent, aside from the stifled cries of those students particularly lactose intolerant. When no one answered after one painfully long minute, Gods said, Right, we're done for the day. Refer to my syllabus for information on C.A.P.S. and other mental health services. Please don't reach out to me.ù The Stanley cup and milk were left to the unlucky janitor assigned to Buchanan Hall, who turned in her resignation shortly after. Some say they can still see the outline of the milky edge burned into the floor where the incident occurred and others avoid entering the lecture hall on the side of the aisle where the cup rolled down completely, saying they leave afterward with unexplained stomach cramps and gas.† †What could possess someone to do this? Do they truly feel uncontent with the strength of their bones at this age?ù Owena Dryers reported back to the Daily Stench, having made the mistake of attending Greek Myth that day. Is it just desperation to feel the nostalgia of childhood by gulping down a tall glass of milk after finishing your vegetables? Is it for the additional protein or the thrill of sheer madness?ù Dryers let loose a long sigh and walked away, too distraught to continue the interview.† The Daily Stench has also received reports that Gods was recently approved for a much-needed sabbaticalù following the incident. He shared that he hopes to visit Paris and experience melancholy.† † Meel F. Lover would never drink milk from a cow, oat, almond or soybean, but is willing to explore remaining options.

daily-stench,LovedIn: how to find romance on networking websites,19-Jan-24,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-19/lovedin-how-to-find-romance-on-networking-websites/," Tinder, Hinge, Christian Mingle: what do they have to offer? These once-beloved apps to find blowjobs and love have become riddled with uggos, serial killers and proletarians. How are you ever going to find your soulmate among this scum? Gauchos, it's time to get professional. It's time to connect. It's time to slide into those LinkedIn DMs. Looking for love on websites like LinkedIn, Handshake and Indeed requires impeccable technique and just the right amount of rizz to ride the line between professional and romantic. As someone who has been targeted not once, but twice, by LinkedIn pickup artists, I am a connoisseur of workplace romance. Here are my top tips on bagging a motivated, career-driven lover on professional websites. On barbarian dating websites, you may calibrate who you're attracted to based on their face, their interests or their hot ass. Throw that all out the window. When you're looking for a professional baddie, only two categories matter: their connections and their experience. Fewer than 100 connections? PASS. No recent work experience? PASS. That's not what you're looking for. Your body is a temple. Aim higher.† The days of Are you looking for a stud? Because I already have an STD, I just need Uù are over. Instead of saying wyd,ù try using more corporate language, like, Can we schedule a time to discuss that fine ass of yours?ù To piggyback off of that, try using other professional interfaces, like Microsoft Teams and Excel, to plan your dates. Invite your love interest to an event on your calendar! Kissing? Fondling? Canoodling? No. Always dance with enough room for an HR professional to stand between you and your partner. Your work always comes first and foremost. Don't make any risky moves with potential suitors that could jeopardize your career. And, remember, always say the HR prayer before indulging in any non-professional activities. Do you think you should be with someone who's as career-driven as you? Yes? Then why are you discussing anything other than your corporate passions? Why would you want someone who cares about stupid things like your day or media or family? If you've really found yourself a good partner, they won't want to discuss anything but work. Even better if they only want to hear about your work! This one is self-explanatory. Will 100% get you laid. Even better if you bring a business card and a cover letter explaining your intentions. As the most professionally desirable person out there, my advice is sound and always guaranteed to get you into that bed (or office). Good luck getting that professional pussy. † Joseph R. Biden knows way too much about sliding into the DMs.

daily-stench,Five nights at FT: Avoiding the RA's when I'm blackout drunk,25-Jan-24,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-25/five-nights-at-ft-avoiding-the-ras-when-im-blackout-drunk/,"In the dead of night (11:30 p.m.), I have somehow braved the 30-minute walk back to my dorm. Draped over my friends' shoulders, I stumble through the door, nearly taking us all down to the floor. The fluorescent lights of the lobby overpower me as the room spins. Come on, you're almost there!ù my friend whisper-yells in my ear, trying to remain unnoticed. His eyes dart around anxiously as he tries to drag me toward the elevator. Once we ride up to my floor, the elevator doors open and BOOM: my RA stares back at me. I can barely hold my footing. Dried vomit coats my chin. My face is covered in dirt from when I couldn't lift my face from the bush that I threw up in. My hair is matted from when I rolled down DP. My shoes have somehow disappeared from my feet, and my pockets have lost all of their belongings. All I can hear is my friend say, shit.ù I lift my eyes to see the RA. Too heavy for my neck, my head sways back and forth as I try to find the balance to look them straight on. All I can see is the intense hallway lighting and a dark figure before me. The RA says something. Annunciating as much as I can, all I can muster is a goodnightù. The RA moves aside as I walk, very normally and in a sober manner, out of the elevator. I turn down the hallway, which now looks miles longer than it did when I last left it. I march my last steps to my door, falling into my friends as they act as bumpers to keep me upright. Their echoing voices are incomprehensible. The second the door opens, and I fly onto my room's floor. Home sweet home. I fall asleep with my head in the trash can when I'm awoken by a loud knock at my door.† RA ON DUTY!ù shakes the floor. The door flies open, and I jump as yellow light pours into the room. The dark figure looms over me yet again. Everywhere I turn, they get me. Why are the RAs never out during the day? Why do I never see them on a Tuesday night when I come back from the uggo zone (library)? The mere two times a week that I inflict a near-death experience upon myself with Tito's mixed with stolen DLG cranberry cocktail, how are the RAs suddenly there? At 1 a.m., I wobble into the bathroom. I'm in nothing but my high school basketball t-shirt and my least sexy underwear. My bare toes grip the grimy tile as I teeter to the sink. I stick my head under the faucet and gulp down the sulfur-flavored, lukewarm water. I loom over the counter. The cold granite feels so good on my face. I look up to the mirror. In a jumpscare move, I find my RA brushing their teeth right next to me. My heart skips a beat. I jolt upwards and dash out of the bathroom as soon as possible. I tumble down the hall, gripping at the walls for balance. The hallway spins in a High School Musical 3ù-esque manner, and I slam into the lime green wallpaper like Troy Bolton.† The RA tears down the hallway, ripping up the carpet and tearing down drywall as they try to catch me. I somehow burst through the door of my room and slam it behind me. The RA bangs on my door so hard that I think it may splinter and break open. Despite their banging, I am at peace next to my permanent carpet stain and empty cans. I drift into a blacked-out daze in the safety of my 5-square-foot home. I have, yet again, escaped my RA. † Joseph R. Biden has yet to turn in an assignment.

Boyfriends scramble for bouquets, shop windows are decorated with shades of red and pink, and we can't forget to mention the corporations who cash in on the whole affair. For a select few lucky souls, this holiday is actually not the bane of their existence but rather a funù and happyù time of the year. Those people are dick-riding fucks.† Speaking of which, MacKenzie McKinsey, local soon-to-be cat woman and knitter of small hats, is looking forward to the 14th of February with bated breath. Despite not being able to file her taxes jointly, she staves off loneliness through her sheer strength of spirit and fortitude of mind. She may not know the touch of another (unless you count intense eye contact with Lenny the cashier at Trader Joe's) but she is jovial, nonetheless.† Contrary to popular belief, I actually receive much correspondence from a variety of suitors,ù McKinsey purrs contentedly. Every year, I receive a beautiful handwritten letter from Dr. Davies complimenting my pearly whites. He always asks to see me for an òappointment' every 3 to 6 months. I get a brazilian wax the night before, just in case.ù She's always bragging about receiving romantic letters from a òdoctor,' but he's actually a dentist,ù says Tolula Merkle, local hater. I mean, nothing wrong with that, but proper terminology is very important. Not to mention, they only do oral.ù† When asked to discuss her other suitors, McKinsey balked. A woman needs her privacy, you know. But between you and me, I also get this fancy annual card from someone advertising their panties. I mean, so dirty, right?ù She blushes. They're always telling me about their òtwo for one' deal, but I don't do threesomes. Too many moving parts, you know?ù† Ever since she began receiving these cards, McKinsey's confidence has skyrocketed. She now struts through Trader Joe's with a chip on her shoulder and a pep in her step. She scoffs, Some may call me a tease, but I simply can't be bothered! When you're as popular as I am, it gets sooo tiring. I guess you wouldn't understand.ù † Miss Informed actually gets cards from her cat's veterinarian too, thank you very much.

daily-stench,Help! Your golden retriever boyfriend won't stop humping my leg,1-Feb-24,4:20 AM,['Fart Tent'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-01/help-your-golden-retriever-boyfriend-wont-stop-humping-my-leg/," It's cuffing season! It seems like every girl nowadays has finally tamed a similar type of guy. He's blonde, super energetic and playful, and sometimes tan. He's always lightening the mood and making you laugh but, also, is loyal and protective î the golden retrieverù boyfriend. No!ù third-year student Anika Purdy said, pushing a golden retriever boyfriend down off her leg. No! Get down! Your goddamn boyfriend won't stop humping my leg!!!!ù† Purdy has been struggling with golden retriever boyfriend Jake, as he has refused to leave her alone, despite her not claiming him. Though Purdy shared that she doesn't wear any kind of scented shampoo, conditioner, soap or perfume, it seems as though Jake just couldn't resist her. You need to be more firm with him. Jake, STOP!ù Jennifer Welter, Jake's self-proclaimed owner, shouted. He just needs to listen to me. Jake î ù Even when offered alternatives, like listening to Baby Keem and Kendrick Lamar's family tiesù or playing Spikeball, he refused to leave Purdy's side, constantly climbing up her leg. This is a singular instance of the problem that Isla Vista is facing, but it is more widespread than you are led to believe. Golden retriever boyfriends are running amuck, refusing to listen to their owners, and bothering anyone who will give them the chance.† Gauchos, if you spot a golden retriever boyfriend with the zoomies, be sure to stop him, build trust and then assert dominance. Oftentimes, giving them a little spritz from a spray bottle with water will teach them their lesson; it's time to start teaching them right from wrong. Though it is a frustrating battle, those free from the clutches of their cutenessù can step in to help with training, ultimately helping all of Isla Vista.† † Fart Tent does not fuck with men.

daily-stench,Liberal? You mean Lib Earl?,1-Feb-24,4:20 PM,['Meel F. Lover'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-01/liberal-just-guy-named-earl-in-the-library/," Do you ever feel sick and tired of hearing about those goddamn liberals all the time? Well, you shouldn't. I only know one lib Earl and he is a very nice man.† I met lib Earl for the first time as I was walking into the ladies' room one late night on the fourth floor. Instead of immediately diverting my gaze as I glanced at him, he smiled at me kindly, as if I had just lit up his day, in a completely non-creepy and totally appreciative way. It takes a special kind of guy to achieve something like that. Even when I was done doing my business, having tooted my own metaphorical horn that was in my butt after a particularly unfortunate run-in with Hana Kitchen, lib Earl was courteous enough to glance up nonchalantly and smile again before getting back to his work, as if he had heard none of the events that had transpired five feet away from his sacred study space. His lib Earl mannerisms, or lib Earl-isms, are so admirable. What a gentleman! Poor lib Earl does not deserve all of the slander he gets. All he wants to do is go to the library every day, at all hours of the day and be the humbly unemployed, dedicated college student that he is as his back bends in a perfect U-arch over his biology homework. Go lib Earl! Yet, day after day, he is forced to endure the slander that people say in passing about other lib Earls and how they refuse to make any progressive change in this country because they're just fine with the status quo!ù Lib Earl is not fine with the status quo! Lib Earl, too, wants to uproot our oppressive systems! Yet, no one ever gives him a chance to defend himself. Once when he tried to argue that he did not just want handouts in order to get ahead of a group of offensively straight white men, they yelled Let's go, Brandon,ù at him, to which his response was to gently remind them that his name was Earl. Lib Earl is trying his best.† You can always see lib Earl in the same spot on the fourth floor, the personable man that he is, studying away to the both neutral and unassuming beats of Lofi Girl. Campus Democrats could have told you that, though, as one of their representatives can always be seen within a few yards of lib Earl. It's unclear whether they operate as protection services for their self-proclaimed mascot, or solely to snap sneaky photos of him for undetermined uses. If I were lib Earl, I would appreciate some free advertising on behalf of Camp Dems. Getting to know some lib Earl better is beyond overdue î the people want what they want!† † Meel F. Lover longs for the day she can finally meet the other lib Earls everyone is always talking about.

daily-stench,No partner? No problem! Print a plastic peen!,8-Feb-24,4:20 AM,['Binzy Eggbag'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-08/no-partner-no-problem-print-a-plastic-peen/," In November 2023, UCSB announced that instead of elevators that don't feel like a trap from Final Destination,ù their latest project to use student tuition on would be the Makerspace, a creative lounge in the library with new, high-quality equipment including laser and vinyl cutters. One piece of machinery seems to have caught everyone's attention† î† a 3D printer. The first days of printing went as expected, excited comp-sci majors forming a line that snaked down the stairs with flash drives filled with intricate models of their favorite anime girls. Thankfully for the sake of the employees, many of the early prints fizzled out into plastic spaghetti.† According to one of these horrifically underpaid student workers, who has requested to remain anonymous, I don't think I've ever seen boobs affected by such little gravity.ù Two weeks after opening, the smell finally began to dissipate, and the art students with technical knowledge began coming to the lounge. Many of the prints created by people who had felt the touch of a woman before seemed to be works of art from one of the spatial art classes. Hand-sized statues were made that could rival ancient Greek sculptures, small flat discs that manipulate light to show off a masterpiece, a paperweight that looks completely different depending on the angle you look at it from. Then the less artistically inclined students began making their prints. Illegally downloaded, low resolution models of beloved and beloathed characters alike. Increasingly unhinged sculpts began leaving the Makerspace until one creative student brought in a file of their own î a 1:1 replica of a mysterious donor's phallus, veins and all. Those in the lounge gathered and gawked as it printed. It has a functional foreskin!ù one onlooker exclaimed. They let us fuss around with it when it finished. It was a bit wet and warm when I got it, but that's not something I want to understand.ù As the remarkably realistic dildo was passed from student to student, employees caught wind of it. The owner of the sham schlong informed them that it came originally from a scan of a long-distance partner's pocket rocket that they exported to a 3D modeling program to refine the details. It was then that a nosy supervisor got an incredible idea for the upcoming holidays: a two for one special on counterfeit cocks. All students would be given the opportunity to print two false flesh flutes for the price of one. Whether it be a complete replica of a pre-existing pecker or a creative attempt at simulating an alien's anaconda, if it has a stand, you can use it instead of your hand.† The deal seems to already be incredibly popular, and the nap pods on the first floor have been temporarily closed. Students exiting the lounge have been showing off their multi-colored magic wands to the lines that trail down and out of the building. To further capitalize off this discount, some talented modelers have offered to create intricate models either based completely on a partner's pork sword or a wildly creative and frankly inhuman custard launcher, many making several hundred in commissions from the sexually-depraved crowd. If you happen to have time in between classes and no lover for this Valentine's Day, or even a partner begging to be pegged, stop by the Makerspace and print yourself a weapon of ass destruction before the deal ends. † Binzy Eggbag knows a man-made meat missile is still better than a man. †

They commodified love and made it a holiday that celebrates whoever can consume the most product from all the different corporations.ù said chemical engineering major Ash Whole. I fucking hate Valentine's Day!ù You know what time it is Gauchos! As Feb. 14 rapidly approaches, couples are racing to make plans and buy presents for each other. But not everyone is willing to celebrate this holiday. In a discussion with his girlfriend, Whole shared that he refused to celebrate the holiday in any capacity due to its sickening association with all things capitalist and corporate.† No, babe, just a card is still just as bad. If we buy ingredients to make a nice dinner at home, we are still participating and performing in this sick display of greed. I'm not getting you anything,ù he said, sure to cover all his bases.† His girlfriend was not so happy with how he viewed the holiday. Biopsychology major Anita Betaboi explained that, to her, Valentine's Day is just another opportunity to express her love for her boyfriend. She chose to surprise him by getting him a couple new games for his PlayStation 5, alongside posters of some of his favorite sports teams. Despite protesting the holiday, Whole gladly accepted these gifts and, according to Betaboi, has already been ignoring her to play the games she bought him.† Well, it's not like I'm gonna make her take them back. She already bought them. Besides, she knows how I feel about the holiday, so it's honestly her fault for getting me shit at all. It's been raining too, so I don't really want to go out and get wet.ù† This Valentine's Day, there may be some harsh discussions between couples like Whole and Betaboi, who can't seem to come to a consensus about how to celebrate. Love is in the air, Gauchos! Whether you hate it or love it, you can always bank on there being chocolate for sale the day after, which is a celebration in and of itself.† † Fart Tent thinks broke boys don't deserve no pussy. I know that's right!

daily-stench,Rizz tips?: Guy I asked out on sunset walk pushes me off the sea bluff,14-Feb-24,4:20 PM,['Toe Schmoburg'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-14/rizz-tips-guy-i-asked-out-on-sunset-walk-pushes-me-off-the-sea-bluff/," Dear inhabitants of Isla Vista,† I'm calling out for help from anyone who has advice to stop this misfortune from falling upon me. Love is constantly slipping through my fingers. It is the time of year, the time of year where love is supposed to be in the air but every time I seek out love, I end up falling through the air.† It all started two years ago when I met with the love of my life, Joe King. He was brave enough to rizz me in the wild (the Buchanan coffee cart, he asked me for my order). I felt particularly touched by this because kids these days always link up on those apps î Twinge, Winder, Crumble or whatever they're called.† I stood with my mouth agape in awe of his beauty (he had a sparse pedo-stash) and immediately confessed my love for him (I ordered a latte with oat milk). It was love at first sight (I didn't make eye contact).† In preparation for our date I conveniently came across his address, class schedule, his parent's house Zestimate, his high school ex-girlfriend's middle school Tumblr, IP address and social security number. I knew that every Friday at sunset he'd be walking along the sea bluff talking on the phone with someone he refers to as babeù î this was a perfect time for our date. I sent him a subliminal message updating him about the status of our date and he responded instantaneously with a resounding yes!ù.† So on Friday at sunset we were walking hand in hand along the bluff (I was trailing 7.5 feet behind him) when I felt like it was the perfect time to declare my love for him. I stopped him (went up to him and grabbed him), lovingly (violently) put both of my hands on his shoulders and I confessed my love for him.† Here, I ask for your help dear reader, because this man has sent me so many mixed signals. He kept yelling WHO ARE YOUù and WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING MEù when I knew inside that I was his one true love and by the end of our date, I had fallen head over heels (he pushed me off the sea bluff yelling HELPù).† After hearing my story, dear citizen, I hope you can procure some advice for me to help parch my barren love life.† Sincerely,† A confused citizen† † Toe Schmoburg has a thing against Love.†

After spending 21 Valentine's Days alone, this girl happened to find herself in a gender neutral bathroom with a tinder beau on the 14th of February ì call it fate!† The young broad entered the bathroom ready to defecate and come to terms with a life of quaint solitude, but unbeknownst to her, the man who had recently messaged her what that pu$$y taste like first thing in the morningù was a mere wall of high-density polyethylene away. As she seated herself on her self-love throne and prepared to fully submit her body to the Wingstop boneless meal for twoù she had obliterated the night before, she heard an equally impressive bowel movement directly next door. As she released her own effortless concerto of garlic parmesan, it undeniably made a sweet, sweet melody with the aggression beside her. Luckily, Stench reporter Harrison Ball happened to be in that very bathroom at the time of the lover's polyphony, and got an exclusive interview moments later, It was like our rectums were singing in perfect harmony,ù she explained in a cold sweat, our digestive systems truly undertook symphonic qualities and made a romantic ballad I will hear in all my private moments to come.ù A bystander compared the bathroom's orchestral union to that of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21ù.†† Shortly after exiting their respective chambers, the two locked eyes realizing they were not merely strangers in the night, but rather former keyboard lovers reunited ì finally able to appreciate each other's physical forms and capabilities. As the two held a blissful gaze, the entire bathroom erupted into applause, with the occupants at the urinals offering a standing ovation. Our unnamed lovers rushed into a tender embrace as the applause endured.† It's not every Valentine's Day we get to celebrate an unexpected union of passion and fate, but we are happy to report the couple was spotted at Wingstop later that night mowing down several cajun corns. It's safe to say I.V.'s newfound favorite darling will likely never be alone again. Monogamy is wonderful! † Theresa Harris-Olson Taylor often questions the institution of marriage.

But in reality, the only thing that is turning Upside Downù is my stomach. And it's not from the stench of the lagoon. Other schools have famous graduates like Obama and Emma Watson, and who do we have? The man who produced the soundtrack for Curious Georgeù. And also Gwyneth Paltrow.† I also found out that he was in an Isla Vista band called Soilù while he spent his time here. You're telling me you joined a band that was named after poop? You're actually disgusting. I'm sure he's a really nice guy but he gives me the vibe of those guys who claim I didn't need to shower today because I didn't really sweat or do anything.ù I heard that there is a rumor his son goes to this school and I just want to say if you are reading this I love and support you. I am sorry that girls are using your father's music to showcase their aesthetic Del Playa homes on TikTok and that I am complaining about it. But WE GET IT. He went to school here.

daily-stench,Idiot stoner packs bong for Super Bowl,15-Feb-24,4:20 PM,['Amanda Lick'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-15/idiot-stoner-packs-bong-for-super-bowl/," My bad guys, how was I supposed to know that the Super BOWL with a team called the Kansas City CHIEFS was not weed related? I mean that is just ridiculous. You know, I don't know a lot about football, but it seems like the perfect occasion to pack a nice bowl and relax. I played football when I was in elementary school but it was the type where we had those flags on our sides, and my parents made me wear those sport goggle glasses that were so ugly. Actually, now that I think about it, that was so humiliating. I often think about what it would have been like to grow up to become a collegiate athlete. My parents probably would have been so happy but instead I rip 2-hour Fortnite sessions in between classes. I also have been trying to write in a journal more. I heard that writing down what you do during the day can help you remember things longer. I can't even remember what I ate for breakfast this morning. I've been watching a lot of true crime documentaries lately and it has been making me more paranoid. Like bitch you could just straight up swing on me with an axe even though we have been roommates for a year and a half. Travis Kelce is on the Chiefs and I can't wait to watch him play. I'm not a Swiftie or anything but it's crazy that the Swifties only had to wait like three months for their favorite team to go to the Super Bowl. Imagine instead of the San Francisco 49ers it was the San Francisco 420ers. That would be crazy. Thank you for being here today and being present with the thoughts on my mind. I've been taking yoga classes and I really think it's helping with my grounding and being able to touch my toes. Rock on everyone. † Amanda Lick likes this little life.

You may find these conspicuous visitors by the new bike shop looking at the new bike shop, or even by the UCen looking at the UCen. You'll recognize them by their ability to stare at you, a college specimen, as you bike past them or by their faux intrigue at the tour guide's improv speech about the significance of Storke Tower as it marks the hour in its signature lack-of-tune.† You may recognize these young folk most characteristically, however, by their quirky-bordering-on-migraine-inducing habit of walking on the rough tarred-and-lined bike paths next to the smooth-and-paved walk paths. Why, you ask? There are a few reasons that could be at play. .  God enjoys quizzing himself on different dog breeds and following Deuxmoi on instagram

daily-stench,Local frat disbanded for hazing after making pledges go to class,22-Feb-24,4:20 PM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-22/local-frat-disbanded-for-hazing-after-making-pledges-go-to-class/," On Friday, Delta Alpha Delta (DAD) was disbanded from UCSB's Interfraternity Council after they received concerning reports of hazing from their current pledge class. Some of the most tormenting rituals that they had to endure included attending all of their classes, turning in their assignments on time and contributing to group projects. These rituals were deemed unacceptable by the Interfraternity Council (IFC) because they directly contradict their anti-hazing policy. Hazing is anything that inflicts unnecessary harm on others for the sake of initiation,ù IFC President and fourth-year economics major Chad Brad said. The rituals that DAD was making their pledges do were straight up inhumane and physically impossible for many of them.ù DAD pledges reported developing serious trauma from the rituals, some even experiencing stress-induced psychosis. Once I actually had to go to class î that shit was insane,ù pledge and first-year communication major Kyler Tyler said. I can't believe I actually had to work on this one group presentation. This crazy bitch in my group was like, òyou need to open your laptop.' I was like, òwhat the fuck is that?'ù† Some pledges were so scarred from the experience that they turned down an interview with The Daily Stench. One source preferred to send in a written statement. DAD shuld bee shut down. i had 2 loggin to canvus four the first tyme and i wus so skared,ù the anonymous pledge wrote. this is crool and unyushual punishmint.ù In light of these allegations, the IFC conducted a further investigation into DAD's hazing process. They found evidence of other brutal rituals, including forcing pledges to take an anti-discrimination course and not allowing them to use Zyns for up to 8 hours. The IFC vows to not allow another incident like this to happen again at UCSB fraternities. If you're in a fraternity, going to class is never okay. A brother should never have to go through that,ù Brad said. We promise to protect every Ethan, Andrew and Jack from ever having to do work again.ù † Joseph R. Biden says, Go Greek!ù

daily-stench,Birth control vending machine now performing lobotomies,29-Feb-24,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-29/birth-control-vending-machine-now-performing-lobotomies/," Left on delivered? Your TA is plotting against you? Last night you performed a half-assed table dance and everyone saw up your skirt? Worry not! Gone are the days of inner turmoil. After the success of the campus library's contraceptive vending machine, it will now offer a new service: lobotomies. Now, you may be wondering: how does a vending machine perform surgery?ù It's really quite simple,ù said vending machine engineer Jordan Hobbes. All you need to do is pay 25 dollars. Then, you just stick your head in the slot at the bottom, and BOOM! The ice pick gets you.ù The stigma of lobotomies may scare potential customers awayìhowever, their benefits can be plentiful. The stress brought upon by avoiding your RA when you're lighting up in your dorm can be easily relieved. The fact that you haven't figured out your housing situation for next year can simply disappear from your mind. Think about your current mind: self-aware, lucid, concerned about the state of America's crumbling democracy. Isn't it hell? After just one quick trip to the library's second floor, you can begin to embody the mindset (or lack thereof) of those shirtless white men who play die in their yards in the middle of the day. Your new vegetable brain will make you so ditsy and unaware that men may actually like you. Your lack of an ability to make decisions will make them go crazy for you. The days of crazy bitchù and saying noù are over. Tap into your ultimate girl brain! Once your frontal lobe is blended into a nice pulp, all you need is a big strong man to lead you around. Now, you may ask, Why don't men get lobotomies?ù Men are actually born naturally lobotomized,ù said Psychology and Brain Sciences Professor Lena Khan. Their frontal lobe essentially stops developing after age six. Lobotomies simply don't change anything when performed on men.ù As we approach midterms, the upcoming election, and bikini season, your head may be riddled with anxiety, feminism, and other nasty ideas. Check out campus' newest resource to ease yourself of these worries! † Women be crazy!

daily-stench,Venmore! Black woman makes hundreds off white friends for Black History Month,29-Feb-24,4:20 PM,['Fart Tent'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-29/venmore-black-woman-makes-hundreds-off-white-friends-for-black-history-month/," Have you given your Black friends $5 for Black History Month yet? If not, you are FAR behind schedule and third year Morris Martin is not afraid to let it be known.† Give a Black person $5, $10 if you are really serious. It's Black History Month. It's the least you can do. These Instagram charity chains can only get us so far. Give your money to a real person, who is right here in front of you. Give me $5!ù Martin said.† Black History Month is an important time to really express your love and gratitude for your Black friends and Black people, and one of the best ways to do that is simply by giving them a bit of money. Martin received hundreds of donations after simply sharing his Venmo on different social media platforms, posting it around campus and pasting it in his apartment window.† He explained that the first people to see the QR code in the window felt especially guilty because they saw him cooking ramen for dinner. They came back an hour later with a home cooked meal and made sure to Venmo him so he could get a sweet treat the next day. Now, he stirs the same old ramen every night around dinner, doing his best to look sad in the window.† My mom is kind of suspicious of me now, she's been asking where I got all this money to eat out. I told her people just love me,ù Martin said, showing us his mom's texts. She's happy she doesn't have to send me money now, at least.ù As Black History Month comes to a close, Martin finds himself budgeting his new profits for the month ahead, working to make the money last. He plans on eating out at least three times every week, thanks to the non-Black allies of UCSB. As the last couple donations trickle in, it's clear that Morris Martin will remember 2024's February for a long time.† It's that one extra day! I swear it makes this month that much better. Happy Black History Month and if you haven't already, you are running out of time. Send me $5 right now.ù Morris said.† † Fart Tent will Venmo you $5.

As a woman myself, it's always my absolute honor to see all that my friends and family are able to achieve, despite the limits the world tries to impose onto us. So, to kick off this March, here's a list of the top five women that you already know I'd make some good history with.† † Yes, she ruined school lunches or whatever. But, if you can find it in yourself to look past that, she's literally drop dead gorgeous. Everyday when she stepped out of the White House, I wondered if her husband was doing enough for her. If it was me, I would've focused more on her and less on whatever other responsibilities he might've had. Michelle Obama, you and I, we would make history together.† † † Oh my goooooooooooood. Y'all saw her in Youù and in The Haunting of Bly Manor,ù and I also saw her there. Though both of those shows had very interesting stories, I was more interested in Victoria. Even when she was going crazy, all I could think about were all the ways I would've helped her through it. She's a talented actress, and if given the chance, I would love to star in a little lesbian romance with her, maybe this time with a HAPPY ENDING. Victoria Pedretti, we would make history together.† † † One thing about SZA and I, we would NOT keep it on the low. She would never have to worry about an ex or killing an ex. I would simply take care of it. There would be doves flying in the wind during our wedding. She could hit the snooze button every morning while I make her breakfast. All of the stars would align for us. SZA PLEASE NOTICE ME. I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, I SWEAR TO GOD. SZA, Sol√°na Imani Rowe, we would make history.† † † Your mom and I have been spending lots of quality time together lately. I can't believe you haven't called her yet this week. No wonder she spends so much of her time with me. Honestly, your mom is the type of woman that is meant to be cherished, meant to be understood and appreciated. Every moment I spend with her, I learn more about the beauty, complexity and love that can be held within a woman. I love her. I'm not afraid to say that. Your mom and I, we are making history together.† † † I've learned enough in English classes to know what the hell is up. Some people, like Emily dearest, have a way with words and know how to charm others. Her writing charmed me over and over again. I just know that we would be beautiful, making a poem out of our lives together. Emily Dickinson, we would make history together. Gauchos, this Women's History Month, take the time to consider those women who have made history and the history that your mom and I are making. I'm your dad now, by the way.† † Fart Tent is in love with women.

DJ was escorted backstage by security where he regained control of his center of gravity and downed a shot of Everclear. Kim promptly returned to the stage and cued Right Roundù by Flo Rida and Kesha, provoking a massive cheer from the audience and returning the energy to the club. Thomas Kim is set to be spinning again the following weekend, but this time he'll keep his balance.† Chase N.

daily-stench,Top 5 best moments from the 2024 Academy Awards!,21-Mar-24,4:20 PM,['Benjamin Epstein'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-03-21/top-5-best-moments-from-the-2024-academy-awards/," The Academy Awards came around and, just like every year, people saw them. You might not have but, thankfully, I did, and I'm here to tell you the best moments. Blunt surprised everyone during her acceptance speech when she paused halfway through, walked into the audience, unhinged her jaw and swallowed a seat filler whole. What a wholesome gal! It was absolutely heartwarming to see crows and ravens put their differences aside to fight their true enemy: Robert de Niro. They attacked De Niro ruthlessly, mercilessly and without hesitation. Thankfully, De Niro came prepared and whipped out his sword. There wasn't a dry eye in the house as fury and feathers filled the stage! A tear was in every throat and a lump was in every eye when Chaplin suddenly walked out from behind a curtain to make his grand re-entrance to the living. The crowd grew silent as he spoke, You thought I was dead motherfuckers? Nah, I was just working on my latest masterpiece!ù Chaplin then proceeded to enact a five-act story about a handless barber with him playing all of the characters, stopping only after the President ordered the FBI to taser him and drag him to a dark dungeon beneath the earth. Truly an inspiration to every human being alive! As a reward for being the greatest filmmaker ever, the academy bequeathed Scorsese with eight golden statues. However, as part of a beautiful artistic piece, Scorsese jammed every last one of those golden statues into the maw of a horse. The name of the horse is unknown, but many theorize it could be Lanzlo, Everett or Horse. What an artistic statement! It was beautiful. In a testament to her love for America, Stone said all 50 capitals of all 50 states during her acceptance speech. She forgot Bismarck and Albany, but no human being is perfect. Truly mesmerizing!† † Benjamin Epstein loves reflecting on the best moments from one of the best nights of one of the best years.

daily-stench,Study finds that holding handlebars while biking is gayù,14-Apr-24,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-14/study-finds-that-holding-handlebars-while-biking-is-gay/,"Having sex with other men, being on Grindr, wearing sunscreen î we know these are all gay for you, as a man, to be doing. All across the planet, researchers work tirelessly every day to discover what could be considered begayviorù (gay behavior). On Monday, a groundbreaking discovery came out of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) that confirmed that if you are a man, touching your handlebars while biking is gay. Researchers report that the only way to avoid allegaytions while biking is to keep your hands folded across your chest or in your pockets. The main research question of this study is, Why is holding your handlebars inherently gay?ù Well, handlebars have an inherently phallic shape,ù laboratory director Annalse Ecks said. If you feel comfortable wrapping your fingers around your handlebars, you might as well just jerk off two guys at once in public while you're at it.ù Once the news of LBL's latest discovery hit UCSB males, the impact was evident.† Gaccusations (gay accusations) are just about the worst thing that can happen to a man nowadays,ù second-year heterosexual studies major Buttep Lugge said. I almost considered throwing handlebars away, along with my other phallic belongings, like my bananas and dildos.ù UCSB understands that this news may be shocking and alarming to some students. They want to reiterate the plethora of campus resources available to those experiencing psychological stress in this trying time. Counseling & Psychological Services [C.A.P.S.] is always available for students to use, but it may be difficult for ststudents (straight students) to access C.A.P.S. via bike paths without using their handlebars,ù campus psychologist Balzin Maimouthe said. We recommend that students take a heterosexual mode of transportation to C.A.P.S., like driving with one hand on the wheel or walking bizarrely slowly.ù In light of this discovery, some students have begun looking into other possible begayvior that they may accidentally be exhibiting. I used to kiss my roommate, Julio, goodnight,ù first-year conservative studies major Dick Zdelishus said. Sometimes, he used to stroke my hair until I fell asleep or suck my dick if I was really down bad, but in a straight way. But the other day, I saw him touching his handlebars, and I'm lowkey worried he's gay now.ù Academic experts weigh in on how UCSB men can avoid gaccusations going forward. The number one thing that men can do to not seem gay is to practice absolute abstinence. For this, we recommend that they start abusing ZYNs, shaving their heads and post-mirror selfies on their Instagram stories,ù virginity professor Eeteng Poossae said. † Joseph R. Biden can't ride a bike or a dick.

daily-stench,Targeted? Other people bought the same swimsuit as me,14-Apr-24,4:20 PM,['Fart Tent'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-14/targeted-other-people-bought-the-same-swimsuit-as-me/,"Faith Talamantez / The Daily Nexus Deltopia has come and gone, and now that the hangovers have fully subsided, many Gauchos have found themselves mourning their individuality. Frequent unintentional twinning has taken a toll on students.† I'm not going to say where I got my top, but in French, it's called, òTarjay,'ù said fourth-year communication major Urbanie Outfritters. I don't know when everyone started shopping there, but apparently every other girl in Isla Vista had to raid my spot.ù† On Deltopia, Outfritters claimed to have seen at least 1738 girls wearing the exact same top, if not one basically exactly fucking like it!ù Unfortunately for girls like Outfritters, previously lowkey places like Target, Ross and Tillys have become all the rave, and every trip has caused rather awkward run-ins for many different students.† I swear, I'd never seen this many people in the clothing section ¶ this has been my literal SPOT for every year I've been here,ù Outfritters said, showing pictures of her white bikini and matching white skirt, in which other girls can be seen in the background wearing similar outfits. Stop fucking shopping here! Get your own store!ù† Unfortunately, as bikini top season rolls in, these terrible instances of ripping off each other's outfits is inevitable for the women of I.V. Most women are well aware of the chances of matching with every other bitch and choose to take it as an opportunity for an aesthetic Instagram feed rather than a check to their originality. In the end, they can frequently take comfort in the certainty that they will outshine any man that they might run into, negating any problem with who's matching with who.† It's honestly whatever ¶ me and my girls looked good in white anyways,ù concluded Outfritters. I don't even care.ù For all Gauchos planning on partying this quarter, be sure to prepare for the chance of a twin. And if you accidentally twin with me, I'll find you, and you'll be sorry. † Fart Tent always does it first.

daily-stench,Groundbreaking Gauchos: UCSB student becomes first frat guy nationwide to discover clitoris,18-Apr-24,4:20 AM,['Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-18/groundbreaking-gauchos-ucsb-student-becomes-first-frat-guy-nationwide-to-discover-clitoris/,"History was made in Isla Vista last Saturday, when a member of Sigla Tau Delta's UCSB chapter found the clitoris. Aidan Thibodeau, a second-year economics major from San Diego County, discovered it at Deltopia, during a brief hookup that occurred at the Danka Gamma sorority house. While the breakthrough has yet to be ratified by the Interfraternity Council (IFC), it is believed to be the first instance of a Greek brother pleasuring a woman.† The clitoris in question belonged to Valerie Munoz, a first-year communication major from the Bay Area, who sat down with Nexustentialism to report on the milestone. He was from STD, so I was expecting him to just last thirty seconds,ù she admitted. And he did. But during foreplay I felt this strange sensation that I hadn't felt with a frat guy before.ù When pressed further on this peculiarity, Munoz concluded, I think it might have been pleasure.ù† Yet, it was difficult for her to pinpoint why Thibodeau had found it when so many others had failed, stating, It was just weird all around. He actually cuddled with me afterwards and even let me hit his vape.ù Despite being the author of the momentous occasion, Thibodeau, who insisted we call him Thibsy because all of his boys do, has been keeping a cool head and staying humble about it. I actually didn't even mean to,ù he told Nexustentialism. I was just fucking around for a sec before I put it in and she made this weird noise. I thought I was tripping.ù But when asked whether he was glad it happened, the answer was a resounding yes. I talked to the brothers about it afterward and they told me how it might have been the clit. So lowkey we all found it.ù He laughed for a moment. The best part was hitting a hype celly with the boys.ù The achievement has turned Thibsy into something of an overnight celebrity: he's been posted on Barstool Sports and his Instagram followers have gone up by over 10,000. Notably, even rival UCSB fraternities have expressed their support for his discovery. Allen Le, a third year from Sigla Alpha Delta, told Nexustentialism, First of all I don't know how the fuck he did that shit. But I'm just glad it was us and not SLO that found it. Fuck SLO.ù UC Santa Barbara released an official statement on their website Sunday morning, commending Thibodeau on his pioneering contributions to the research community.ù† Thibsy conceded that his newfound fame was slightly difficult to handle. It's kind of a lot. Nationals wants me to come to the headquarters in Nashville to present my findings. And I've got an interview coming up with somebody big on TV. I just can't say who.ù But he's taking the development in stride. Now that chicks know about my reputation, I might be able to get with some actual tens.ù With Thibsy's success, the chances of a frat man locating the clitoris on a given hookup now skyrocket to 1 in 300,000. One small step for a brother, one giant leap for fratkind. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow will find your clitoris, with your consent of course.

daily-stench,Your mustache can't hide everything,18-Apr-24,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-18/your-mustache-cant-hide-everything/,"Juliet Becker / Daily Nexus Since the turn of the 21st century, angry bitch feminists have been trying to hold men accountable for their crimes. You're being misogynistic!ù You've never made me finish!ù #MeToo!ù Girl, shut up! Everything changed when the great stachedemic of 2024 took the world by storm. The public has become blind to male wrongdoings. UCSB men, in particular, have been allowed to wreak havoc across Isla Vista behind the mask of upper lip pubes. Recently-mustached men report that they enjoy reaping the benefits of this newfound loophole.† Bitches now automatically assume I'm a sensitive artist for some reason,ù third-year economics major and secret Republican Ethan Riley said. I don't have to do any heavy lifting anymore in convincing girls that I'm a good person. Manipulation has never been easier.ù Experts have analyzed the science behind why and how mustaches have hypnotized impressionable (horny) women. A strange phenomenon occurs when ugly, heinous, disgusting, abhorrent men that strike fear in your soul when you look at them grow a weak mustache,ù gender studies professor Natasha Nuiscanse said. The possibility of them being a bad person evaporates to women as they, for some reason, only associate positive personality traits with mustaches.ù However, mustaches alone cannot completely conceal male evil. There is a full package associated with the malicious mustached-man aesthetic. Baggy jeans, Birkenstock Bostons, ZYN abuse and a surprisingly alt-right political ideology are quintessential to avoiding accountability. Local officials warn I.V. women of the danger of mustached men and offer advice on how to avoid their wrath. We strongly recommend that women stay away from men found at Caje and in PHIL classes,ù Santa Barbara County Sheriff Daryl Kunnt said. These men are extremely high-risk when it comes to growing mustaches or displaying equally heinous behavior.ù It is more crucial than ever for women to stay vigilant in these trying times. Ladies, keep your head on a swivel. Gents, keep your upper lips bare. Joseph R. Biden mustache you a question but will shave it for later.

daily-stench,I'm not high: Chipwrecked,20-Apr-24,4:20 AM,['Mary Jane'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-20/im-not-high-chipwrecked/,"To my dearest Gauchos and fans, I broadcast to you live from my couch in Isla Vista. Tonight, we are connected through nature and its wonderful properties. It's been an interesting day î Isla Vista crowded with the families of many and the alumni of past years. I was moved to tears during my daily coffee run. We are so lucky to be surrounded by such a loving community. We are so lucky to live in paradise.† Even though I'm not high, today I've really taken a moment to appreciate the beauty of I.V., and the beauty of community.† Hey guys, this is their roommate. Not sure how this happened because they are not high, but I've been greening out off contact highs since 9 a.m. I woke up GRENED OUT!!! And so I'm not sure how this happened because of course my roommate is not high but the thing iss that there is so much beauty in this world that we could never even hope to understand, and what goes on in my lungs while I'm asleep is between my lungs and GOD. I would never hope to interfere in such a mysterious process but instead enjoy this moment and now I'm watching Five Nights at Freddy'sù.† Now it's me again, not the roommate. Freddy Fazbear is a character who I relate to in the sense that I love the color brown and also bears. Bears are very relevant to my life these days î they are an important symbol of the California wildlife, which of course I care about deeply. And also I like bowties.† If I was an animal though, I would be a deer. It's kind of because of my freckles but mostly because of the anxious vibe in general. Anyway, I'm so happy to have been able to reconnect with you again î in this moment in time when we are Not High. I hope you enjoyed your 4/20/24 (palindrome 420), and spent your day absolutely Not High. Mary Jane is not high.

daily-stench,Top 5 tips to be the worst roommate,25-Apr-24,4:20 AM,['Binzy Eggbag'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-25/top-5-tips-to-be-the-worst-roommate/,"Actions speak louder than words, why just say you want your roomie gone? So the end of the year is quickly approaching and leases need to be reviewed, but you have one critical problem: you want to live with your bestie instead of your roommate! Unfortunately, your roomie has made no plans to move out and time is running out before that renewal notice comes in. Worry not! Here's our list of ways to be the worst roommate that we guarantee will have them scrambling to find a new lease. 1. Change the Wi-Fi password.† Does your roommate have recorded lectures they need to review or homework assignments due in an hour or so? Change the Wi-Fi password without informing them! It's most likely that the first 20 minutes will be spent frantically trying to reset the router as they waste their data to email the professor about tech issues. Once they realize that it's not the router at all, feel free to ignore any texts or calls for the next couple hours and say that you were in class. If you're feeling up for the challenge, concoct a story on the importance of the lecture they were interrupting. Don't forget to give them the incorrect password a handful of times before finally giving up the right one. For a fun twist, take the router with you instead! Who needs a hotspot when you have a mobile source in your bag? 2. Sleep in their bed. Their bed always looks so comfy, doesn't it? A nice mattress pad, a fluffy blanket and a mountain of pillows would make a lovely cocoon for a sleepy little guy such as yourself. Sure, you have your own bed and even the couch in the living room, but that's just so boring and it's really important to shake things up! If and when they confront you, give them a lecture on how important it is for you as a student to have new experiences and try new things.† 3. Disrupt meal plans.† Everyone knows how important it is to eat proper amounts of food and to not buy too much. One of the easiest things you can do to ruin their week is totally stir up their meal scheduling! Help yourself to their leftovers, but leave one bite in the container so they keep their hopes up when they grab it. Does your roommate have mild specific dietary needs like being dairy-free? Finish off the last carton of their favorite milk alternative without telling them so they don't realize until mid-way into making a meal! Consider inviting a friend over when dinner for only you two was planned so food has to be portioned in a way that it's just slightly not enough. You'll have your roommate praying to a god they don't believe in for the 9 p.m. bus to actually arrive because the real villain here is the 27.† 4. Master the art of hypocrisy. If you find yourself needing a new hobby while forcing your current roommate out, consider learning the age-old technique of hypocrisy. It may take a lot of research and a brief online class on gaslighting before you get the hang of it, but hypocrisy is this writer's Top Tip! This is also the most versatile on our list and the most customizable to your situation. Scold your roommate for not doing chores perfectly and neglect yours entirely, tell them off for not engaging in conversation and refuse to communicate over anything, criticize them for leaving a pair of shoes in the wrong spot and leave your whole dirty laundry basket on the couch. Don't forget to utilize those gaslighting skills you learn along the way to make your roommate feel guilty for even bringing that up.† 5. Win the blame game.† The final tip this writer has to offer is to blame your roommate for every problem that pops up, especially totally illogical ones. It's optional to believe that they've really caused any of these but it makes it far easier to come up with things that could never be your fault. Did you track mud everywhere after yet another biblical-level flood? That's actually your roommate's fault for not designing a predictive automatic maid. You didn't wash your pile of dishes and the sink is starting to smell really bad? Clearly, your roommate was using it as a secret compost bin and just didn't take out your old things first. If it's a problem that affects you, it's something you can blame on them, because obviously you can do no wrong! That does it for this week's tips and tricks list. Obviously, not all of these can apply to everyone's situation, so feel free to mix and match to best fulfill your own roommate needs! Never forget that you are a perfect angel and you have never done anything wrong, and I love you so much. Your roommate should have known better and it is 100% their fault for not being a fully developed person while in college. These should get them well on their way onto the street, especially if you can isolate them from everyone else they know! Binzy Eggbag is incredible to live with.

RuPaul only talked about drag,25-Apr-24,4:20 AM,['Fart Tent'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-25/what-the-frack-rupaul-only-talked-about-drag/,"This past Thursday, UC Santa Barbara had a very exciting guest speaker, a real gem within the drilling community. After leasing mineral rights to oil companies on his ranch,† RuPaul became a notable celebrity figure within the fracking community, and was widely praised for his ability to normalize fracking in a world where it is not very widely accepted.† Students came thrilled to see him speak to this experience and share what it was like to overcome the stereotypes surrounding people who are interested in drilling for natural gas and oils. Many even came with their own rocks that had natural gasses trapped in them, hoping to get them signed by RuPaul. Much to the disappointment of these students, RuPaul did not once mention fracking, oil, natural gasses or any kind of fossil fuel.† When he said drag, I thought it would be about dragging out negotiations in Congress to free up people's ability to harvest the Earth's natural resources,ù said economics major Kiki Bootsenhaus. Is RuPaul very fast? I don't get why he hosts a race.ù Most students who attended the event were completely unaware of RuPaul's history of working with drag queens, and were only aware of his prominent role in the fracking community. Even more so, most students were under the assumption that drag raceù referred to a type of sport involving racing cars.† Lightning McQueen over here talking about sewing. Who the fuck sews in drag race?ù asked mechanical engineering major Sashay Dethdraup.† It's important to do your research in advance of attending these speaker events, Gauchos. In the future, knowing all the things that any given speaker is involved in will allow you to fully enjoy these events without the risk of learning about something that you did not want to learn about.† Fart Tent boots the house cunt slay yass queen.†

daily-stench,Predictive tabling: dressing to avoid the Arbor tablers,2-May-24,4:20 AM,['Binzy Eggbag'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-02/predictive-tabling-dressing-to-avoid-the-arbor-tablers/,"Why act beyond disinterested when you can change your entire wardrobe instead? Walking through the Arbor is a fate worse than death most days. Those petition-wielding beggars can smell a vulnerable person like a shark smells blood. Tablers will force you into a conversation, even if you had your nose so far down into your phone that the bikers would blame you for getting hit in the bike-free zone. One devoted reporter, Callahn Mei, has decided to sacrifice themself to the cause to determine the best way to dress to best avoid these attention whores.† Upon the office being informed of this groundbreaking research to change everyone's lives for the better, the team joined together to create highly realistic full face masks so that Mei could perform their research and avoid being recognized to keep the results unbiased. The mission was to set out to create the perfect and most neutral set of faces to not alert any specific category of group, but the team of 11 all somehow made the same replica of Chancellor Henry T. Yang artificially de-aged and hauntingly ungendered.† We weren't even all in the office together or working at the same time,ù one of the editors said. We were all just so enchanted by Yang's image that it's impossible to escape it. We love you Mr. Yancellor.ù Mei spent approximately a week and a half gathering the information, testing different combinations of outfits and experimenting with paying attention to the tablers or not. They reported that a lack of attention had approximately no impact on results whatsoever, but God rest your soul if you make eye contact with anyone, no matter how long it lasts. Mei reported that, of all tabling groups, appearance mattered least to California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) and Turning Point USA (TPUSA), as both groups called out desperately for someone to take them seriously and were overjoyed when someone didn't flee the scene immediately after noticing their posters.† I think the one time CALPIRG didn't talk to me out of the 16 times I saw them was when everyone at their table was preoccupied,ù Mei said. Mei also noted that while Jack Whitman of TPUSA did engage with them each time, most of the attempts were invitations to debate if the foreign language requirement was really necessary.† The most important findings from their research circled around the Greek life tablers. I did get a fair bit of attention on walk-bys while wearing some sort of paraphernalia from a frat or sorority,ù Mei reports. They somehow noticed the socks too î I guess that one guy was not kidding about the foot thing.ù When in a full suit, Mei lost the attention of regular frats and was approached by several of the professional frats but also experienced the same when in a pair of incredibly baggy sweatpants and a scrub top they borrowedù from a lab. It's a little bit of a confidence killer to not have the girlies fawning over me, but you have to do what you must. I feel like this might not have been worth it.ù†† Mei's final reports on the case concluded that the best way to dress to avoid any attention from any group is to look completely insane. Socks with sandals (to avoid that foot guy too), an oversized green tee and a sad tutu ended up being the combination with the least attention. That and a full Taylor Swift merch suit. They were afraid of the person that could have been.† Binzy Eggbag is worried they have never slayed hard enough to be worthy of a frat invite.

A paramilitary group, armed with nunchucks and BuzzBallz, stormed Corwin Pavilion during a meeting of the Senate, quickly seizing control of the proceedings. As the insurgency swept across the chamber, Off-Campus Senator Eric Shun took center stage, flanked by two guards. †It's time for the Associated Students government to finally represent the people,ù he stated in a speech that was immediately streamed live on his Instagram, @lilericshun. So from now on, I am declaring myself supreme leader of the new Associated Students' Totalitarian Dictatorship.ù† The military group, which numbered in the dozens, has now been converted into the official Associated Students' Totalitarian Dictatorship (A.S.T.D.) Police Force. It's unclear how former Senator Shun was able to recruit it, but one Gaucho, who insisted on the pseudonym Tannerù to maintain anonymity, told Nexustentialism his theory. I'm actually really glad this whole military coup thing happened,ù Tanner said. Before this, I never knew what the Senate was doing with our $16 million. Now I realize their year of inaction and incompetence was only because Eric had spent the whole budget on a private, well-trained militia.ù Reporters from Nexustentialism took to the streets, risking their lives in order to interview students about the new change. All identities given have been changed to preserve anonymity. Fourth-year chemistry major Sadieù was hopeful about the new regime. Maybe with direct military intervention, we'll actually be able to solve the housing crisis,ù she said. Other students were more worried about the authoritarian overtones of the newly declared military state. Eric said he would have any dissenters thrown into the lagoon or forced to work at DLG,ù said second-year communications major Jake.ù That terrifies me.ù The policies of the A.S.T.D., which Shun laid out in an official statement yesterday, are indeed a stark change from the days of the Senate. They include requiring you to pay at the Arbor, bringing back Munger Hall and banning the use of all words that rhyme with Valentine.ù But third-year political science major Stellaù wanted to reassure us that it's not as bad as it seems. If this is too frightening, just remember that you can always just do what you did in the past and forget that student government exists.ù Even as this new regime threatens the freedom of the student press, Nexustentialism is committed to maintain the publication of the unvarnished truth at all costs. We will continue to report on the situation as new facts emerge. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow has A.S.T.D.

Are you bored of hearing about discrimination in your ethnicity requirement? Are you ready for a getaway from all the partying, tanning and being just a girl? Join your sisters in learning how to truly change the world in an immersive woke liberal trip!† Local sorority Kappa Nu Tau (KNT) announced that they will be traveling to Maui's Ritz-Carlton resort later this month in order to become educated on Polynesian culture and to maybe be less racist. KNT sisters report their excitement for the experience ahead. I'm really excited to learn about the Asian people or whatever,ù second-year psychological and brain sciences major and KNT merch designer Kacie Andrew said. But what I'm more excited about is our tropical TG this week with Ligma Pi. I can't wait to wear my coconut bra!ù The trip's organizer has planned a rigorous and educational itinerary for KNT's weekend. The second we land, we'll all have Mai Tais waiting for us in the rooms,ù third-year communication major and KNT social chair Emily Emerson said. Then, for breakfast the next day, we'll have Pi√±a Coladas and go snorkeling. Then, we're going to a sacred beach where we'll have the opportunity to pet newborn endangered baby seals!ù Members of KNT hope to reiterate the importance of trips like these for the good of the Hawaiian or whatever people.ù Hawaiòi would be nothing without people like us. I mean, they love tourists! The good of the local economy depends on us going there,ù fourth-year pre-biology major and KNT president Julia White said. Plus, they love us so much! I heard the front desk proletarians even give you òlays' when you arrive.ù However, some sisters are concerned about how the islands will receive them. I heard a lot of these salty Hawaiians get mad when you go. I mean, it's the United States! You don't hear people from L.A. getting mad when you go there,ù second-year dance major and KNT self-tan director Grace Thomas said. They need to stop† gatekeeping.ù Nexustentialism reached out to the Maui Ritz-Carlton's staff to inquire about their excitement for the upcoming trip. Girl whatever,ù the hotel's communication director Maile Alohi said. Joseph R. Biden says you are entitled to the world.

daily-stench,Mauna Kall to action: Chancellor Yang trapped in telescope,9-May-24,4:20 AM,['Fart Tent'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-09/116195/,"The University of California Board of Rejects has long been subject to protests surrounding their project to build a telescope on Mauna Kea, a land that is sacred both culturally and environmentally to Native Hawaiians. Although protests have delayed construction up to this point, changes are swiftly being made after first-year English major Mia Alama trapped Chancellor Henry T. Yang in a telescope. Not so fun now, is it? He looks so silly in there,ù Alama said. I just want to carry him in my pocket like a little elf!ù Alama has been stationed at the Arbor every day for the past week, allowing people to look at Chancellor Yang trapped in a huge telescope. Students have gathered around him almost constantly, the crowd never falling below 50. Many students came armed with tomatoes and posters listing their many complaints with the chancellor's actions in Hawai'i. Many took pictures with Yang in the background. The chancellor seemed relatively unbothered by the protesting students, and instead, seemed to enjoy them tapping on the glass.† The telescope quickly garnered the attention of the larger Santa Barbara area, and toward the end of the week, campus was seeing record numbers of visitors, curious about the chancellor in a telescope. His trap, designed by Alama to mimic the one being potentially built in Hawai'i, is a whopping 30 meters, making it only slightly shorter than Storke Tower. As Alama has explained, Mauna Kea is a dormant volcano, and access to the summit was meant to be restricted to only high-ranking Hawaiian leaders.† When asked if she has any plans to release Yang, Alama explained that she plans to keep him in the telescope until he sees things from a new perspective. She promises that she has been feeding him wet lettuce and crackers every few hours, which seems to be his preferred diet.† I think it's good that we're finally making him uncomfortable in a way he can't avoid,ù said third-year Biology major Robert Roodriguez. Although, when I saw him on DP during Deltopia, he did look pretty weirded out.ù† Currently, Yang remains in the telescope, and rests in a little ball against one of the telescope walls. Crowds have been consistent, but orderly, often waking up Yang from his sleep with their chants. If any of you Gauchos haven't taken a look, be sure to, and remind Chancellor Yang that Hawai'i is not his land to build on! Fart Tent is curious if anyone knows how to make a big telescope.

In an effort to lock in, I had my laptop open only to the New York Times Connections and my wedding Pinterest board. Deep in my work, I was unfortunately interrupted by the lecture happening at the table behind me. So, we went to his room and we started hooking up when he went soft FOUR times!ù second-year economics major and super sorority sister Emma Park said. His dick was only like 4 inches hard though, so is there really a difference?ù Disturbed by the copious unsolicited details, I instead focused my attention on eavesdropping on the table in front of me. We were fucking like normal, and then guess what he said,ù first-year communication major Julie Boucher said. He looks me dead in the eyes and goes, òspeak French to me.' Like, hello? Isn't that cultural appropriation or something?ù Again, perturbed, I turned up the music in my headphones and looked at the Connections words before me. Sexy,ù Gorgeous,ù Hilarious,ù Schizophrenicù¶things that I am? Unable to concentrate, I looked up to the menu to examine the potential of buying another drink. I was alarmed, in the moment between looking at my laptop and glancing at the menu, to make eye contact with a woman as she yelled to her audience, He really loves when I suck on his balls. Like, does that even feel good? Or is it just a power thing?ù It was my final straw. I could no longer handle the cacophony that was the Sunday Caj√© sorority sexual debrief. As I packed up my things, I took off my headphones. Then, the voices really got me. And before I knew it, he was sucking on my toes!ù I tripped over my table leaping up so fast. I knew that I had to escape. I told him I was on my period and he didn't care.ù His cum tasted like his mango FLUM. Ew!ù As I saw the beacon of light that was the exit, I ran the gauntlet of women that have been victims of porn-addicted frat guys. Then he told me to call him daddy.ù He asked to stick it in my ass!ù My backpack ajar and my soul traumatized, I stepped into the Embarcadero del Norte daylight. I organized myself and began my journey home. Maybe the communal Caj√© debrief was an expression of collective trauma. Maybe it was a safe space for those with nowhere else to go. Or, maybe, it's just time to speak quieter in public. And just like that, Joseph R. Biden was celibate.

daily-stench,Resourceful Gaucho offering colonoscopies from DP apartment,16-May-24,4:20 AM,['Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-16/resourceful-gaucho-offering-colonoscopies-from-dp-apartment/,"Move aside, student barbers: Third-year communication major Steve Balboa has taken entrepreneurship to the next level by offering colonoscopies from his oceanside apartment on the 66 block of Del Playa Drive. Much like his haircutting counterparts, Balboa has capitalized on a college-based market that has a lot of demand and virtually no supply, thanks to America's atrocious, privatized healthcare system. Thanks to this savvy market move, Balboa has looked at over 45 students' large intestines so far in 2024. Balboa markets himself from his Instagram account, @poked.by.steve, where he posts edits of him performing on his clients accompanied to drill music. His rates are reasonable: $50 for a routine examination and $100 to have it done with anesthetic, which is not hospital-grade but rather a big-ass dose of ket.ù As a self-taught practitioner, Balboa is occasionally the target of skepticism, but he has the numbers to support his deft skills with a tube: He has only had seven accidental perforationsù this year, a remarkable 84% success rate. Even though doctors don't recommend getting colonoscopies until you're 45, fuck that. Pull up to the crib and get one done anyway,ù Balboa told Nexustentialism. Colorectal cancer is not a laughing matter.ù Fourth-year linguistics major Elvin Priestly didn't necessarily have getting a tube-mounted camera shoved up his rectum on a balcony overlooking the Pacific Oceanù on his college bucket list, but then again, colon cancer wasn't on it either. Thanks to Steve, I was able to identify the tumor before it became critical. I've got a follow-up appointment with him to get it removed in a few weeks,ù he said. Other members of the community, though, have less-than-glowing reviews of the services that Balboa provided.† He ripped his bong a bunch of times during my colonoscopy,ù second-year undeclared student Jenny Sampson told us. That caused him to fuck up really badly, and now I have a gastrointestinal rupture with diffuse peritonitis.ù The chances of surviving her condition are 60%.
 At least one Gaucho î we suspect there are multiple î sought out Balboa for a different reason. Third-year economics major Jake Daniels got his colonoscopy with no anesthetic†because I wanted to feel something,ù he said in an interview with Nexustentialism, after hobbling into the room. And boy did I.ù Since his colonoscopies have been such a success with students, Balboa plans to move into a base of clients that actually needs them at their age: professors. I talked to my comm prof about it,ù he said. For some reason, he wasn't really into it, maybe òcause I told him he has to be cool with my homie Coop DJing during the procedure, but he'll come around.ù Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow just scheduled his vasectomy for outside of 7/11.

daily-stench,UCSB's Most Pissable Urinals: A Review,23-May-24,4:20 AM,"['Pubelius Comestock', 'Marcus T.C.']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-23/ucsbs-most-pissable-urinals-a-review/," Let's set the scene: the smell of newly illegal substances in the air, a smooth bass groove playing in the background and discussion of women's liberation abound as men with huge afros and unbuttoned collared shirts with floral patterns sit around a table discussing how to make the urinals in Physical Sciences North as palatable as possible. The result? A standard set of urinals, with nice 70's style tiling lining the walls. UCSB's most standard urinals offer an enjoyable, unmemorable urinary experience. One must wonder why there is not shaggy carpet lining the floors around the urinals to complete the aesthetic. If a barefoot student cannot dig his toes and feel a squelch while using a urinal, has the designer succeeded, even if it is functional? In spite of this obvious oversight, these latrines present the standard male bathroom experience, and for many students, an unremarkable restroom trip is what constitutes a good one. 7/10  This one's for the thinkers and dreamers. The ones with big imaginations who can't stop thinking about urinals. What are these layers? Is it an onion, an ogre? Are they triple chins? Buzz Lightyear's helmet? Are they molting? My current theory is that they are a defense mechanism. Like a lizard sheds its tail, these urinals eject the top layer of their bowl upon imminent danger. But since the retreat of devious lick kids, urinals have no natural predators. Ultimately, the true purpose of its design continues to elude me. I recommend more unconventional experiments to uncover this. I guess you could always just shit in it. 8/10  Sleek, elegant, refined. Those are all words that I would not use for this bathroom. Rather, this efficient, high-capissity waste chamber looks like it was created to handle a drunken ballpark, not Girvetz Hall. Minimal urinal-to-urinal distance, absence of flush handles and even an ergonomic ball shelf cultivate the ideal hammered experience. I would never condone drinking on campus, but rest easy knowing UC Santa Barbara is looking out for you if ever find yourself with a full bladder and a 15 Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) after a rough, rough midterm. If you are not alone, feel free to hold hands to trigger the secret room hidden in the far wall. 9/10 (minus a point for no beer shelf)  Knock knock, who's there? Somebody's stuck in the stall because you just haaad to take a piss. You're stuck with two options: waddle forward mid-piss or stand your ground and let the stall-dweller sit, contemplating the true depravity of shitting in a public toilet. Both options have their downsides. Waddling forward decreases accuracy, and a closer proximity to the urinal/wall runs the risk of splattering piss back onto yourself. Standing your ground also has its risks. Stage fright can set in and increase the time it takes to piss, and it could even upset the person waiting. The last thing you want is for them to lose patience and slam the door open (while you're defenseless), knocking you over and leaving you to suffer in a puddle of your own creation. Needless to say, this urinal is not for the faint of heart. Tread lightly. 3/10  Have you ever wondered what the cuck chair of urinals looks like? Well look no further than the Materials Research Laboratory's premier spot, complete with a wet floorù sign, to prevent the user from getting too comfortable. Located right next to the lab showers, the elongated shape of the urinal fits nicely between one's legs to offer them a warm yet unsettling sensation, helping their flow and providing some minimal privacy. The pissoir causes the user to be totally unaware of their surroundings, facing into a corner surrounded on three sides by walls, thus making them susceptible to (not so) subtle mockery by their peers. 9/10  Any urinal review would be incomplete without the inclusion of the Buchanan Hall urinals with their iconic underbites. Countless students have pissed here and countless more students have wondered why they chose this shape for the urinals. The Jay Leno of urinals. Their sleek and aerodynamic form created an optimal structure for an efficient piss, tempting brave bathroom goers to test their range. Suffers from a lack of dividers, but all in all a nice place to go before showing up late to your introductory political science course. 7/10 (would be a lot cooler with some modern art to fill the empty walls)  Ever since the Catholic Church began performing baptisms in this very bowl in 1955, students and faculty at the Marine Biotech Lab have wanted to use it as an indoor outhouse. Under the reform-minded Pope Francis, they finally got their wish. The results were wondrous: women and children cheered in the streets, men wept and held each other, dogs and cats lived together and Marine Biotech researchers rejoiced by using their new urinal until the rivers flowed yellow. Once the commotion settled down, the urinal ceased being known by the general populace but is still appreciated by the researchers. They understand how the calming ocean colors put the user at ease, how the wide bowl shape takes one's eyes of aiming† and how the spout between the legs captures every last drop. Its only flaw lies in its unsightly divider, which ought to be removed completely, allowing the room's theme to shine through as the breeze wafts the men gently while they use it. 8/10  Aww, pissing all alone little boy? No, you're with your bro! Picture this: it's a warm summer day, you're playing frisbee with your best bud on the Chem Lawn when those Capri Suns you had start to hit and you both need to take a leak. Do you go one at a time, holding your head in shame as you are totally alone? Or do you walk to the Chemistry Building hand-in-hand, heads held high as you partake in a cooperative urination session that will bring you closer than ever before. As you're almost finished, and looking into each other's eyes as a single tear rolls down your friend's cheek, you'll know that you made the right decision relieving yourselves in the Chemistry Building's buddy urinals. 4/10  You know it, I know it, we all know it: the fourth floor of [REDACTED] hall is UCSB's premier bathroom spot, and it knows it. Long thought to be mythical, Marcus T.C. and Pubelius, the Nexus' finest reporters, found it after several months of trekking over river, forest and hill. Once the vines were cut back from the doorway, we found a quaint bathroom with a good sturdy door and lots of space to spread out in, for the whole room and the beautiful view are your kingdom once you sit on the porcelain throne. The crackable window provides numerous advantages, be it simply feeling the breeze on a warm day or airing out, and the full sink and mirror allow total freedom in what the user wishes to do after their bathroom experience. It may be well known, but this bathroom is worth the hype, and we felt we must include it, despite its dubious categorization as a urinal. 10/10 Bored with crossing streams, Marcus T.C. and Pubelius are currently experimenting with double-decker shitting.
Print  Œî  Œî This is simply magical. I am tearing up from this beautiful article. The writing, the photography, the beautiful stylistic devices, and figures of speech. I am eternally grateful to †Pubelius Comestock†and†Marcus T.C. for this amazing experience. Excuse me, it is time for me to take a piss. Cheers gents, may your liquid gold flow freely and gracefully into the porcelain throne. Just like the men who watched the explosion of the trinity project, I have just seen history in the making. Shakespeare has nothing to this, in fact his writing will be replaced in a matter of months with what was just written. Pissin alone little boyù will be a household saying.

daily-stench,Best questions to ask during lecture,30-May-24,4:20 AM,['Theresa Harris-Olson Taylor'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-30/best-questions-to-ask-during-lecture/," Don't be shy! Asking questions is an important part of the academic process î and a great way to assert yourself over your weak-minded peers! However, not all questions are created equal, so here is a comprehensive list of the BEST questions to really wow your professors and stake your claim as an academic weapon.† The more you ask this question, the better. A surefire way to earn your classmates' respect.† Asserting yourself as a sexually viable option will indicate you are an alpha both inside and outside of the classroom.† Similar to question #1, being a needy fucking piece of shit is a great trick to have up your sleeve! Next quarter, try abandoning common sense or syllabus comprehension and instead demand instant answers. Bonus points for a slight whine.† Stun your professors with this one. A great way to open up the classroom for broader discussion and societal analysis.† Not a question, but a great strategy. Everyone loves listening to the sound of your voice just as much as you do!† Lecturing in front of hundreds of Gen Zers can be unnerving, let your cunty professor know they are a part of the flock!

daily-stench,Best Arbor Characters,30-May-24,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-30/best-arbor-characters/,"For any Gaucho, running the gauntlet that is the Arbor walkway is an arduous, unavoidable and annoying-as-fuck task. While every day at the Arbor feels like it offers a new crop of tablers there to make you feel awkward, the seasoned Arbor frequenter knows that some returning characters make the walkway worth visiting. Do you ever want to go about your day without being shouted at by a middle-aged conservative man who wants attention? Well, I'm sorry to report that today, the guy from the Epoch Times is on campus. He'll debate you about anything and will do everything he can to reel you in. He's old, he's creepy and he's angrier than thou. We're all awaiting his return in the fall to recruit spunky new journalists. An Arbor classic, the most aggressive, terrifying and unavoidableù award goes to CALPIRG with their thousands of tablers and clipboards. I heard they can smell fear. Do you care about climate change?ù No, bitch! Let me go! Nevertheless, CALPIRG persists, despite their terrible reputation and weird, nerdy army. Give me my 10 dollars back! Nobody looks camp straight in the eye in the Arbor walkway like Charlie Kirk's sweethearts, the TPUSA idiots. Such iconic signs as Why so socialist?ù light up campus and rival even Nexustentialism in comedic genius. Being a self-declared white supremacist at UCSB is definitely a brave choice, making TPUSA perhaps the bravest Arbor warriors. The quiet majority is certainly looking pretty loud and tiny! Oh, Arbor characters, how we will miss you over the summer. Joseph R. Biden says you either die getting harassed in the Arbor or you live long enough to see yourself harass passers by in the Arbor.

daily-stench,Help! The girls on the high school tours scare me,14-Jul-24,4:20 AM,['Joseph R. Biden'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-07-14/help-the-girls-on-the-high-school-tours-scare-me/,"It was a classic spring quarter Sunday: I woke up in a random bed on ò66 block with nothing but my socks, a raging migraine, and a manù. Our collective stench was comprised of Marlboro Reds, B.O., and regret. As I reached for my phone that was lost somewhere in the sea of cum-stained navy sheets, I realized that I must have left my dignity at home. After a few minutes of contemplating joining the church, I scrambled around on the sticky floor for my barely-there party outfit from the night before. In my mini skirt that rode up my ass and a Fall Rush ò23ù t-shirt that I'd stolen from my victim, I crept out of the cave coated with posters of sexy women and tiptoed over the empty Pacifico bottles left on the floor. I stepped into the daylight and began my journey home. The crowd of onlookers at Caj√© was typical. The sorority girls with their slicked-back morning afterù look traveled in packs. My obvious walk-of-shame outfit and smeared eyeliner didn't bring me shame before the usuals. However, everything changed when I crossed through Pardall tunnel. Like exiting the birth canal and facing a room full of doctors, I came into the light of campus to see the worst possible sight: a high school tour. I made eye contact with a group of horrifying 15 year-old girls. Suddenly, I had tunnel vision. My ears rang. I had my Kill Bill moment as the pack of girls stared me down. They wore flared low-rise jeans and Sambas. Their hair was littered with 500-dollar highlights. They looked suspiciously mature, but still had braces for some reason. I somehow disappeared from UCSB and was transported to my kitchen, where I ate baby carrots alone after freshman year homecoming rather than being invited to the popular kids' afterparty. The flashback was visceral, like my own little Christmas Carol. I understood Vietnam veterans at that moment because there's no way that Vietnam was as bad as that.† I came back to consciousness as I passed the tour. I looked (and smelled) like I had been dead for 10 days. Since when do high schoolers have perfect skin? Since when do they wield Longchamp bags instead of backpacks? Since when am I, a barely legal, sexy woman, supposedly looked down upon by these little virgin teenagers who probably won't even get into this school? Why do they scare me so much? I stared at my feet like Charlie Brown while Lucy and Linus tracked my every move with their L'Or√©al Sky High Mascara-caked eyes. The girls shared snarky whispers amongst themselves while I slinked by like that Toy Story dog.† As I snuck by Storke Tower and eventually fobbed my way into the safety of my dorm, I reflected on the traumatic experience that I had just had. Was this God's was of punishing me for being a skank? Or was I helping these girls to see their future? They might be young and glowing now, as I once was in my youth, but I suppose there comes a point in every woman's life where she looks in the mirror and sees a sunken, cigarette-stained old hag. † Joseph R. Biden is channeling òSleepy Joe'.
