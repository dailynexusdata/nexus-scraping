photo,Campus Comment:Students Perspective on Finals Week,17-Apr-18,1:31 AM,['Daily Nexus Photography'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-17/campus-commentstudents-perspective-on-finals-week/," The Daily Nexus is excited to announce the revival of Campus Comment! Campus Comment was originally a short column in the print paper with student commentary about campus life and Isla Vista. Today, the section will similarly feature perspectives from UC Santa Barbara students as they make their way through life at UCSB. Here's how these UCSB students deal with the stress that came with finals week of Winter Quarter, juggling academics and their own mental health. ""I rarely get over-stressed, and that's probably because I always give a good amount of time to dance. By allowing myself time to get out of the chair, out of my head and into my whole body, my time spent dancing feels almost meditative. I'm able to take a step (or lots of steps) back and clear my mind through exerting myself to the physical limit. I can tell myself that if I can Break, there's nothing I cannot do.""ù -Kai Goh, Third Year, Film and Media Studies MajorPhoto by Lianna Nakashima, Daily Nexus † ""Dance challenges me to face the work and struggle of a process rather than shy away from it. It pushes me out of my comfort zone to find value and pleasure in not knowing and having to explore. What a liberation to realize that the voice in my head is not who I am.""ù -Paris Cullen, Fourth Year, Dance and Psychology Double MajorPhoto by Lianna Nakashima † ""When I think of ""òstress', the first word that comes to mind is ""òanxiety'. The two coexist for many people and personally, I've never been the best at handling stress. I tend to over commit myself until my plate of responsibilities is completely full. I think keeping yourself busy is healthy in the sense that it forces you to perfect your time management skills. But I also believe that in perfecting those skills, the stress and anxiety that comes with having a lot of responsibilities can sometimes be overwhelming. I am a double major, with two jobs, sorority demands and I still manage to make my mental health a priority. It's all about your headspace and finding out ways to relax. For me, it's walking to and from school, going to the beach, and reading every night before bed.""ù -Kalena Cortez, Fourth Year, Biological Anthropology and Dance Double MajorPhoto by Lianna Nakashima † ""Sometimes I really kick myself over-stressing, so I have a lot of ways to take a break. Snacking is the best, Trolli eggs and ice cream are my go to. Strategic power naps can save a day. When things really start kicking into maximum overdrive, nothing is more relaxing than cleaning the house""ìClorox wipes are honestly holy.""ù -Jasper Tung, Third Year, Psychological and Brain Sciences MajorPhoto by Will Tran, Daily Nexus Though finals are far away midterms are starting to roll around the corner. Remember keep your health in mind! Have a good day, see y'all around campus.

photo,Campus Comment: Santa Barbara Weather Galore,30-Apr-18,7:04 PM,['Daily Nexus Photography'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-30/campus-comment-santa-barbara-weather-galore/,"This year, the UC Santa Barbara campus has been hit by myriad of weather phenomena. From ashes to heavy rain, it seems like the only thing that hasn't fallen from the sky is hail (knock on wood). Here are some student testimonials on the ever-changing weather of Santa Barbara. ""I wasn't exactly prepared for the cold. I know coming in as a freshmen, it was a beach town so it would be colder than where I'm from. This cold was unexpected, and it's hard to bike in the wind. I think that everyone on campus is lost with new year ""òbrightness.' Like for example, now that everyone's found who they're living with next year, they're not as open to making new friends as before, which is definitely natural. But I guess it's just sad to see that people are not as open to making new connections. In the end, though, I got my friends and they got me so everything will be alright,""ù Jessica Ko, first-year.Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus † ""Well, the cold is so unpredictable these days; like, I left all of my winter stuff back at home because I said to myself, ""òYou know what? The cold in SB is nonexistent.' I'm from NorCal where the cold is everywhere, and all of a sudden this quarter it just hit us. Midterms are just midterms: You gotta power through, [and there] really isn't much you can do about it. I just hope for the best, you know? It's kind of a wing-it type of thing. I don't even have a study schedule; I'm not really that organized. But hey, I'll figure my life out with my whole schedule and everything""ù -Kisakwi Naiga, first-year.Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus ""So the weather change from sunny skies to this winter-esque is absolutely terrible. Thank you, Santa Barbara, I brought all of my summer clothes: I brought my rompers, shorts and we're out here freezing, and it's a mess, and the bike rides to campus when you have an 8 a.m. in the cold are really building character because it's a true struggle. I'm defeated,""ù Mia Salas, first-year.Kaitlyn Nguyen / Daily Nexus † ""I'm from the Bay Area, so the weather feels similar to back home, so it's kind of comforting in a way. The wind is crazy, though, and it's very irritating, especially bike riding. I feel like I'm going to fall off my bike in this wind, but I just throw on some jackets and push through it!""ù Jacqui Decareau, first-year.Andrea Verdugo / Daily Nexus

Accompanied by an entourage of local California rappers, Bas took Santa Barbara locals for a ride on his Milky Way Tour.  Opening for him was Correy C, an LA bred rapper who has collaborated on many past Dreamville projects such as ""Pinball II""ù by Bas and the Dreamers II song ""Grow""ù by Cozz. He riled up the crowd with heavy raps reminiscent of Atlanta trap music, setting the energy for the following act.  Next came Innanet James, a lyrically endowed rapper who hit the bones with his smooth choruses and crushing delivery that picked up momentum with every verse. He effortlessly showed that trap lyricism isn't the only thing that can get the neck banging.  Following Innanet James was Berkeley, California rapper Rexx Life Raj, whose poignant and critical bars bring to light topics that cry for recognition over stirring R&B melodies. A funny and charming personality, he eased the anticipation by introducing the main act, Bas, the Sudanese rapper from Queens, New York.  Signed to J. Cole's Dreamville Records, Bas's third studio album, Milky Way, was released on August 24th, 2018. The album revolves around the topic of self-love and ""searching for ground""ù. During his set, Bas's wistful verses brought about a sense of longing and melancholy on songs like ""Night Job"" and ""Dopamine""ù. His more spirited temper delivered the heat in songs like ""Methylone""ù and ""Mook in New Mexico"", drawing out the screams and chants of the die-hard fans in the crowd. He knew when to slow it down and pick it right back up, engaging the crowd with the intensity and depth of a black hole, a force befitting of the Milky Way Tour.

The 11 a.m. strike, protesting†the October announcement that the world has just over a decade to get climate change under control, lasted just over 30 minutes. During the event, the†group also†called for California Senator Dianne Feinstein and the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors to wholeheartedly endorse the Green New Deal. One of the leaders of UCSB's strike†was Rose†Strauss, a third-year UCSB student who went viral last year after a politician called her ""young and†na√Øve""ù for asking about his campaign contributions from fossil fuel executives. ""With eleven years left to stop climate change, our leaders, who claim to represent us, have still not endorsed the Green New Deal: the only solution we have to climate change that addresses the scale and scope of the crisis in the way that science and justice demand,""ù said a statement posted to the event's Facebook page. ""Failing to take action on this crisis is a death sentence for our generation. When we strike, we will send a clear message to people in power that if they can't do their jobs and protect the people of this country, we won't do our jobs or go to school.""ù Check out some of the photos Nexus photographers captured below: This slideshow requires JavaScript.

Very nice of them to also honor our first Afro-american president, who was elected 11 year ago! Go get em  goyim! All of these proposed measures are meaningless unless we decrease our population. Yet,the government ( US, and California in particular give) give free stuff to people who continue to have large families. I am awaiting the calls of racist as I point out that the group having the largest birth rate in SB county, according to health dept statistics in Hispanic.

photo,Playboi Carti Headlines Extravaganza 2019,23-May-19,12:06 AM,"['Daily Nexus Photography', 'Sunidhi Sridhar']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/playboi-carti-headlines-extravaganza-2019/,"Extravaganza 2019 is officially in the books. With a diverse lineup and better-than-expected weather, UCSB's venerated music festival succeeded in drawing an energized crowd as thousands of Gauchos descended on Harder Stadium for a Sunday afternoon of great music and quality time with friends.  Arguably the flagship event for the A.S. Program Board, Extravaganza takes place every year toward the end of Spring Quarter. There is always much hype surrounding the concert, and this year was no different. After the lineup was announced a week in advance, the campus was buzzing with excitement as students commended the eclectic group of artists slated to perform.  From the moment Harder Stadium opened its gates, the line of eager and animated students was unrelenting and at times grew to be chaotic under the conditions, snaking its way down the street and past the adjacent baseball field. Upon entering, concertgoers melted into the throng as they found their friends sprawled out on the lawn or laughing by the bleachers. Various campus organizations manned the white campus tents lining the field, where students were able to purchase refreshments and even stock up on free wristbands and reusable water bottles blazoned with the event logo.  The honor of opening this year's Extravaganza was designated to Peach Pit, a niche indie band hailing from Vancouver. Despite being relatively unknown in comparison to the other performers, this band boasts a modest yet dedicated following, as evidenced by the attendees who showed up early just to catch their set. The band's dreamy surf sound set the mood for the rest of the balmy Sunday afternoon, as the stadium reverberated with the euphonious acoustics of the guitar and the vibrant echoes of the drum set. Next up was L.A.-based indie pop singer Empress Of, who received wider recognition for her recent collaboration with Khalid on the track ""Suncity.""ù For an artist still on the rise, Empress Of had an impressive stage presence, captivating the crowd with her flair and authenticity throughout the set. Many audience members were not familiar with her music, but this did not stop them from waving their arms to the rhythm as they attempted to sing along, which was a testament to the artist's infectious energy as a performer.  Deorro took to the stage shortly after and was met with an audience primed for the rest of the show. The EDM powerhouse undoubtedly raised the energy within the stadium to fiery new heights, as Gauchos continued to mob the stage with each and every exhilarating beat drop. During his hour-long act, Deorro remixed pretty much every club anthem of the century, and never once failed to send the delirious, alcohol-fueled crowd into a state of elation. Wrapping up his set with a mix of T-Pain's iconic ""Buy U A Drank,""ù Deorro turned around and asked the raving masses for a picture, to which they enthusiastically obliged. † While not the headlining act in name, Amin√©'s performance shone through the others as his effervescence and synchrony with the audience was unparalleled. DJ Madison LST, Amin√©'s tour DJ, came out on stage to hype up the crowd before the Portland rapper took to the mic. Amin√© was the festival's biggest draw for concertgoers, and when asked if they were ready for him to come out, they responded by erupting into deafening cheers of endorsement. Sporting a black graphic sweatshirt and chains, the rapper prefaced his performance with a special request for the audience. ""When I say ""òYou're beautiful,' I want you all to say ""òI know!'""ù he roared over the massive turnout. Amin√© then kicked off his performance with a rendition of his song ""Yellow,""ù followed by several tracks off his sophomore album ONEPOINTFIVE, including ""RATCHET SATURN GIRL""ù and ""SHINE.""ù He also threw in a few fan favorites off of his debut project Good For You, including the playful pop-rap hybrid ""Spice Girl""ù and, of course, a sparkling piano rendition of ""Caroline,""ù the multi-platinum record that sent him through the ranks of the hip-hop scene.  The real showstopper, however, was Amin√©'s explosive performance of ""REEL IT IN.""ù Here came his second request of the night: ""I want everyone here to get up and mosh!""ù The rapper's wish was the crowd's command as the area in front of the stage transformed into a blur of sweaty bodies slamming into each other and the air was filled with the resounding roar of the crowd belting the lyrics. Fans were not shy with their acclaim as Amin√© signed off for the evening.  At this point, the mob that had formed around center stage started to swell as the stream of concertgoers entering the arena picked up the pace. This year's Extravaganza headliner, Playboi Carti, was scheduled to go on at any moment, and no one wanted to miss a single second of the Atlanta rapper's act. Either due to tardiness or deliberately coaxed anticipation, Carti took the mic an hour and a half late. In the face of cramped muscles and a brief drizzle, the audience was no less thrilled when he finally arrived on stage, as people elbowed their way through to get as close to the action as possible. A man of few words, Carti simply mumbled something into the microphone before opening his set, feeding off the energy almost palpable in the air. Instead of performing tracks in their entirety, the rapper chose to sample several verses from his extensive repertoire, including ""Half & Half""ù and ""dothatshit!""ù from his eponymous debut mixtape as well as ""FlatBed Freestyle""ù and ""R.I.P. Fredo""ù of follow-up album Die Lit. Carti capped Extravaganza with ""Magnolia,""ù his most viral track to date, and never have more people simultaneously Milly Rocked than that evening at Harder Stadium.  Overall, this year's Extravaganza delivered on its promise to provide Gauchos with an enjoyable escape from the mundane Sunday routine and the impending stress of finals season. Despite the less than ideal queue to enter the venue, the event was complete with a sweeping lineup that appealed to a wide range of music lovers and time with friends under the sun. UCSB's personalized Coachella will surely be missed, and here's looking at next year's festival weekend.

The conference ""ì organized by†a group of six students from UCSB's Queer Commission ""ì†addressed several topics,†including gender and identity-based violence beyond Central American borders, navigating S.T.E.M. as a part of the LGBTQ+ community and the gender and legal name-changing process. ""Being able to host this space is really important because we can see that at the university, there are other people who are like us. We do have a large community, and hopefully that moves at least one person to stay in college. We would have another queer person of color being able to graduate college, when statistically speaking, it is already hard to get in here, and even harder to [graduate],""ù said†Ricardo Uribe, a former Letters and Science senator with the 69th Senate.

The class, taught by Professor Kip Fulbeck, examines the integration of art into everyday life. At the end of the quarter, students tackle a ""personal space""ù assignment, in which students seek to occupy public spaces with pieces of performance art. One of this quarter's projects, located on the walkway between HSSB and Theater and Dance West, is titled ""Get out of my personal space""ù and tackled the recent Alabama law that effectively†banned abortion in the state. The art piece, created by UC Santa Barbara†third-year global studies†Ryann McCollum, featured several wooden poles with the faces of the 25 men who voted yes on the bill; the men's faces are blurred out, with varying phrases written on top including ""It's not the '60s anymore""ù and ""What about my life?""ù McCollum said she created the piece as a comment on the recent laws and how ""women's bodies and reproductive systems continue to be dictated by white republican men in government.""ù ""I saw an opportunity to turn my art into activism. I hope that those who experienced the installation would become more conscious about the paradox between the lawmakers and those reaping the effects of the laws dictated by them, [and] as well as are inspired to join the fight against the patriarchy,""ù McCollum said in a statement to the Nexus.† The piece's description, as outlined in a piece of paper taped to the ground, reads: """"òGet out of my personal space' is a piece created to comment on how laws pertaining to women's bodies and reproductive systems continue to be dictated by white men in government. This piece was triggered by the state of Alabama government voting to ban abortions to the extent of incest and rape. This law has now became the United State's most restrictive abortion regulation. The law received 25 votes of 35 indicated to ban abortion ""ì all 25 of these votes came from white, republican men.""ù Photos of the project, taken by Nexus photographers, can be viewed below: This slideshow requires JavaScript.

Mu√±oz, who is originally from Tlaxcala, Mexico, charges $1.50 for tacos and $6 for quesadillas. For any house that is willing to host his stand, Mu√±oz offers 50 free tacos in exchange for use of the venue.† He estimates that he serves around 100 customers each day his stand is open, totaling an approximate 600 tacos in addition to the numerous quesadillas and mulitas. He works the stand along with his nephew and his friend, preferring to maintain a small team in order to ensure quality of the food he serves and to build close relationships with his customers, he told the Nexus.† ""I think food in Isla Vista is expensive. When the food and rent costs so much, the students are unhappy. I believe we are helping students by offering our tacos,""ù Mu√±oz said. He initially learned how to cook while employed at a food truck in Long Beach called Los Tres Garcias, working as a chef there for two years before moving to a restaurant in Gardena, California, called El Antojito Tacos y Mariscos, where he stayed for another six years. After moving to the Santa Barbara area, Mu√±oz briefly worked at the Subway in UC Santa Barbara's Arbor. Mu√±oz explained that his dream is to eventually relocate his taco stand to the Arbor ""ì as a small indoor eatery or a permanent food stall, much like Die Bretzel or Woodstock's ""ì†in order to better serve the students and connect with more customers.† Photos taken at one of Mu√±oz's†set ups on Del Playa Drive can be viewed below:† This slideshow requires JavaScript.

Climate Change is global and unless the US and other 1st World Nations step up and enforce law and change in practices that many believe hurts the environment globally, one or two countries doing something isn't enough.  Thus, are we saying that military force might have to be used to force all countries to comply.  Could this be the fire the ignites World World III, which we always thought would be due to a lack of resources and not to save the climate? Unless the population is brought under control, these feel good steps we are taking mean nothing.

The rally was organized by UCSB's Graduate Student Association, which called upon UCSC to ""immediately pay the Cost of Living Adjustment""ù in a Facebook event for the UCSB rally. ""Many of us at UC Santa Barbara share the experience of being paid poverty wages for our academic labor in the face of exorbitant, ever-skyrocketing rent, and thus also struggle to make ends meet,""ù the description of the Facebook event stated. Dozens of UCSB students also signed a petition in support of the UCSC strike. The petition calls on the UCSC administration to pay the COLA and condemns ""all attempts by the administration to intimidate striking student workers.""ù A Twitter account run by the strikers, with the description ""Pay us enough to live here,""ù has been posting nearly every hour about the strike; a thread posted about the strike explained that organizers have been calling for a COLA since Sept. 2019. UCSC released a statement in response to the strike on Dec. 9, stating ""Lack of affordable housing in Santa Cruz presents challenges for our students and for our community as a whole.""ù ""We are actively working on short- and long-term solutions to address our students' housing needs,""ù the statement says.

The student holds a review session once a week, 2 hours of office hours and grades papers.  Some departments do abuse the students.  Most do not. You may struggle to survive on graduate support, but stop the BS.  It is not money for ""academic labor""ù.  It is money to allow you to take courses and meet requirements without having to hold another job. It is really quite simple.  If you cannot live on the money you are given, do not come to the UC.  If you are here and in good standing, transfer.  Simple. These strikers are hero's they are standing up against this brutal capitalist system that has divided everyone up into a commodity and turned them into a profit you have administrators at this UC College making six figure incomes sitting behind a desk not doing shit the wasteful spending taking place on a police force that criminalizes students and gives them some bogus charges that ruins the rest of there chances of ever having a career THESE STRIKERS ARE NOT JUST STANDING UP FOR A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THEMSELVES THEY ARE STANDING UP FOR EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT'S""¶†Read more ª Agree

In fact, I hope my children have to struggle and suffer an even worse life than me. These people do have a better life.

Many work 2 + jobs. So educate yourself before you make tone-deaf comments. I'm a graduate student working two jobs, and I care about the livelihood of my friends and colleagues, many of whom are barely making it. Seeking change and challenging power doesn't make one lazy. Not performing your assigned duties because you'd rather stand around and beg for a little more cash is not ""seeking change and challenging power""ù. I have TA's right now who have skipped multiple sessions to ""stand in solidarity""ù, which has wasted the time and money of both myself and my peers.  And if they work, then they shouldn't be asking for a cost of living adjustment. The whole point is that they want to get paid enough so they don't have to work at all. Graduate pay + that from another job or two is far more than livable. Oh. Were you misled by the UC's financial offer on acceptance? Did you not understand what you would be paid in exchange for a free graduate education? Were you forced to accept that offer? I would suggest that, assuming you had offers from other schools in cheaper surrounds and perhaps higher TA compensation (and PLEASE do not retread the tired mantra ""î we work N [very large] hours as a TA.

UCSC graduate students are currently in their third week of striking for COLA, meaning that they have stopped all grading and teaching. † This slideshow requires JavaScript.
Print This slideshow requires JavaScript. As a former UCSB grad student, I want to give the current grad students some hints on how I did it. I never had the newest phone or laptop. I never went on Spring break.  I spent 0 dollars on alcohol or drugs. I never owned designer anything. I very rarely ate out. I did take some student loans, but after graduation, for 3 years I continued to live in cheap apartments so that I could pay off my loans. After graduation, I did need a car to get to work. I bought a used 7 year old car. It's so condescending that you seem to think that grad students at large aren't already doing these things. Do you really thing a TA who is resorting to sleeping in their office/car is also buying the newest iphone and designer clothing? When you know you can't afford something and you do it anyways, that is a personal choice. I don't disagree that TAs should be paid more. Most everyone should be paid more and have benefits and more time off. BUT if you agree to something you cannot afford, you have made a choice. Same applies to student loans. I looked at student loans years ago and said, wow that would be a small mortgage. I cannot afford that. So I worked full time through college and kept my loans to nearly nothing/almost nothing. People want to have a certain life""¶†Read more ª Your comment is naive, flippant, and out of touch. I suppose my trying to make a life for myself is a personal choice. I am a proud and grateful PhD student at UCSB. Leave for a cheaper place? Do you have any idea what some of us had to do to get here? It took me 7 years of university education (GPA 3.8+) and three degrees just to land a PhD placement in a program from which I might have a fighting chance on the job market after graduation. I was paid 11k to teach 6 classes per year while""¶†Read more ª You made a choice to go here knowing the reality and don't like it.  But no where in your rant does it address personal agency and the fact that you chose this opposed to many many other life paths It sounds like you made poor life decisions. You weren't the top of your class but still really worked hard and made it here and no you realize you aren't going to make it in the top tier(a professorship at a good research school). So along with the realization you will not achieve your dream you now resent your own situation (one that you put yourself into through many decisions). Instead of seeing your position as a series of decisions that you made you see your self as a victim to an oppressive system the you had no part in.""¶†Read more ª I agree with you! Yeah holding up a sign that says ""fuck you""ù is supposed to convince me to listen to you""¶lol. Pretty much. ""Fuck you I want what I want.""ù I even want to listen to their point but with many people holding these signs, fuck you I don't want to listen. Pretty much. I'm just saying what would convince me and I'm not sure how others feel. I was taught to be nice to get what you want but I learned how cold the world really is. Yeah, because major social movements have succeeded because they ""asked politely.""ù Look up ""respectability politics.""ù Worked for MLK. The TA's at UCSC we're fired today lol should've been done a long time ago!! If other UC TA's pull the same bs I hope they're all fired ASAP. The joke is on you haters because we are going to win a COLA. Easy""¶ Ooooh, too bad.  Strikers fired from UC Santa Cruz.  Welcome to the real work, snowflake. Thanks for that burst of energy. Gonna crush economic injustice with every spare moment and breathe of energy I have. Fuck you. You sound like a small child whining that life isn't fair Can the two of you sit down and have civil discourse. What the hell is wrong with both of you. The fact that they were fired is a testament to how UCs cannot handle this problem. This action only fueled the already existing class struggle. Termination of employment? Good luck finding TAs next year. UCSC professors are already siding with the students. It's only a matter of time until the whole system collapses. The only reason why TAs get paid so shitty is there is a tidal wave of people who want to do it. Maybe if they had trouble getting some next year wages would rise. Professors often focus more on their research than teaching, but that's not to say that they can't do the job without TAs. There isn't exactly a shortage of people applying to grad schools. In fact, too many choose to invest in grad school without having a clear goal of what they will be doing with that degree and end up in insurmountable debt. Professors siding with students says nothing. It's not as though the professors themselves are paying the students, they've got nothing to lose except helpful mentees who are replaced every few years anyway after they graduate.

But of course it's all about what they want and screw everyone else. I refuse to support this strike because of their behavior. I am pushing for all of them to be fired! Do y'all know the actual point of a strike? They can protest what they please but they have no right to impede upon other's right to enter a public building and block entrances. They also have no right to stalk UC Staff and call them PIGS, because they work, or follow them to the bathroom and call them SCABS.  Shame on you!!! YESSS!!! They harassed staff terribly! Definitely not supporting these selfish jerks. They need to take their chants and shove it! Those idiots don't even know what a ""scab""ù is! Nobody is replacing you in your job, geniuses! They're trying to do their own job! They have no right to harass, scream, yell and intimidate innocent people who also need to make a living to support their own families. Take your temper tantrums elsewhere! ""oh no! student workers who can't afford housing and food disrupted a workplace for a couple of hours??!""ù quit pretending you ever would have supported the strike or the precarious workers who keep this university running. They didn't just ""disrupt""ù. They screamed at and harassed staff relentlessly. If you or I did this in public, we'd be arrested for disturbing the peace. And yet these little jerks get off scott free! HA ""keep this university running?""ù What a joke. There are a good many others who do exactly that job without being a nuisance. ""F**k the UC and the bi**h named Janet""ù  Real class folks.  No wonder why so many working Californians have turned against UC students. Ok boomer Ahhhh yes. When you don't have a good reply, just discredit their validity as a person that can have an opinion. Dehumanize those who disagree with you. Remember! Some are more equal than others. That's the best you can do? OK boomer.  Sorry, little boy, I am 46. The little turds of today have no idea what a Boomer is""¶ I've seen it thrown around at people as young as 30 when that person don't agree with them. That's their only come back from their tantrums. I'm sure even if they were more ""polite""ù, you still would be policing their respectability. Strikes are not about being polite. This is exactly why my company refuses to interview UC grads. Probably for the best. Maybe folks are policing the strikers' misogyny. Cultivating sympathy is as important as communicating outrage. Surely there are better ways to accomplish both than calling Janet a *****, etc.. Call upon the cola movement to disavow  misogynistic sloganeering. I support the strike, but I do agree with this- misogynistic language has no place in our movement. I've heard a lot of those in the movement express concern over this. However, I don't think that unfortunate word choices should be used to justify dismissing the entire movement. The photo of the banner ""F*** the UC and a b****named Janet""ù has now been on the front page of the Daily Nexus for three days.  It is not merely an ""unfortunate word choice.""ù  This was the banner the movement chose to display in the most symbolic place of all: the front of Cheadle Hall. Take responsibility for the movement culture you are creating and insist more forcefully on what must be changed. It's not like individual banners are voted on by the several thousand grad students who were marching that day. The individuals who were at Cheadle made that banner- there are what, 6 people holding it? Out of several thousand that are a part of the larger movement. Individuals make their own banners and take them to the strike. How is anyone supposed to perfectly regulate something like this? Fair or not, the Daily Nexus has made this the dominant image of the strike.  Hard to control individual placards for sure.  But the major banner in front of Cheadle? Definitely in bad taste. Future employers, think twice before hiring a UCSB grad student. Sadly, this has been happening for a while. I worked at several places that if they hired students straight out of college, they preferred students from Cal State universities because they often have immediately useful work experience which is often part of their curriculum before they graduate. Many UC grads compared to their Cal State peers, were often clueless about the real world and how to do basic things like writing formal letters. They also often behaved entitled as though the task assigned to them was ""below""ù them. I've seen several of them come and go and become replaced with""¶†Read more ª #COLA #hypocrites These agitators are aggressive and are looking for a fight. Probably want to provoke and record some sort of altercation with police or staff that they can post online and make themselves look like ""victims.""ù Not true. Years ago, undergrad students went on strike (not sure what the subject was) and occupied Cheadle as well. A friend of mine working there at the time said that they were respectful and pleasant, working on their own laptops even though they were camped out in the lobbies. How you make other people feel matters! And they will always remember it! Figures. The undergrads that these people claim to teach have more sense and respect and behave more like adults than them. UC Graduate Students are CALIFORNIA WORKERS TOO. THEY ARE TASKED WITH TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN AND SHOULD BE PAID A LIVING WAGE. We should stop giving them free tuition and then give them what they're asking for out of that money. Maybe then you'll realize how fucking good you have it compared to graduate students across the rest of the country. They don't have free tuition""¶ They literally get full tuition remission""¶ do you even go here? Yes, they do. Grad school is not like undergrad. Often grad/PHD students don't take classes in the same way that undergrads do. Hell, in some programs, for most of their time they aren't taking classes at all (and instead doing research in labs, for instance)- and yet they are still ""charged""ù tuition. So they're getting ""waived""ù for something that they really shouldn't be charged for in the first place. Grad programs at research universities differ from those at, say, a small liberal arts college. You are expected to perform considerable labor and research FOR the university, in addition to ""your""ù research that is""¶†Read more ª Absurd. Graduate students are also students and are considered so until they earn their degree and the appropriate skills of their field. The institution of graduate students was such that it was a mentorship of a few selected individuals who were taken under the wing of professors. Work done as part of their learning is just that, learning. Don't be mistaken, graduate students are there to learn and have requisites for the degree to fill and are charged tuition just like undergraduate students who are there to learn, which if you have a good advisor, will find funding to cover""¶†Read more ª Being a TA is not a part of their education (i.e. their degree requirements) ""ì it is a JOB that they are doing for the university in addition to classes, research, etc. that actually count towards their degree. These requisites for degree completion go beyond just taking classes like it is for undergrads. The sad reality is that TAs now do much of the real work of teaching undergrads- it's worryingly common for undergrads to barely see or communicate with their actual professors. Grading, office hours, fielding student questions/concerns, lecturing and leading discussion sections, not to mention learning and mastering""¶†Read more ª It sounds like then the system should work as is but the professors push their work on to the grad students.

YOU DECIDED TO GO THERE.  NOBODY FORCED YOU!  IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!""¶ OR MAYBE NOBODY ELSE WANTED YOU??? BINGO!!! Since when was a PhD a right? It's NOT!

Also, nobody has pointed out that the TAs are STILL GETTING PAID BY THE UNIVERSITY WHILE ON STRIKE""¶.this is not a strike, it's just entitled children holding their hands out for a payoff. Take a ride in working class Socal neighborhoods if you want to see exploitation and social injustice. What a joke. Yes, they've been paid for the rest of the quarter, and yet THEY are doing everything they can to prevent staff from working! Staff need to earn a living too, and THEY'RE NOT PAID UPFRONT! They're cloistered in their own little bubbles pretending they know everything about the world. They have no clue. How about you step out of your sheltered university bubble and see how EVERYONE is burdened by high rent and don't ask for free handouts and instead find ways to EARN it? Nobody forced you to invest in a higher degree it's a privilege, not a right. Get out of those diapers and into the real world and make yourself useful to society instead of whining about demanding more taxpayer dollars for doing nothing worth benefitting society but lining your own ego so you can flaunt your degree while working a mediocre job because surprise, in the real world employers""¶†Read more ª Who got stuck in traffic due to them taking over the Henley Gate entrance today? Demanding a raise that will cost the University $65 million, and at the same time demanding that the University not raise fees to pay for it?  These grad students believe in unicorns and pixie dust.  Frightening that this is the level of intellectual rigor ""¶ and more frightening that UCSB will probably bestow doctorates on most of these geniuses. UCLA just raised 3 billion dollars through fundraising, and Berkeley is on pace to raise 6B by 2022. The money exists in the system, it just needs to be reallocated away from the inflated salaries of administrators. Ah, the ever ready magic wand of citing inflated salaries of administrators, when you actually haven't a clue about how to pay for it. The way was explained. Re-allocate funds. Also, it stands to reason that by paying workers more those workers will be able to contribute more to the overall economy. The UC is a huge employer, and they create revenue like a business. They should pay all their workers a living wage. Then again, I'm probably having this argument with somebody who believes in the wonder of ""trickle-down economics.""ù There is no reason that hundreds of admins should make 10-20x the amount as graduate students, researchers, staff, lecturers, or faculty. you are partly correct but grad students are not full time employees and already get their tuition.  The demands are absurd And so, I take it that your plan is to cut $65 million worth of administrative salaries and benefits expense, in order to generate the funds to give graduate students, both employees and non-employees, the $1,800 per month ""COLA""ù?  Is this your plan?  You're proposing massive faculty and staff terminations, totalling $65 million, to do this. Agreed. Considering the fact that faculty and staff generally live in the local area, terminating them will have a greater negative effect on the regional economy. Grad students are only here temporarily, and then most of them leave for other opportunities. Their impact on the local economy is much lower than faculty and staff. In fact, if they all left, the rest of us would probably be able to afford housing ourselves! A lot of the time, donors have a say in where the money gets allocated. You can't assume it's all free to spend for any use. Not sure where you're getting the 65mil figure from, but just to put things into perspective, the University of California system contributes more than $46 BILLION yearly to the state's economy. It's the 3rd largest employer in the state. They can come up with that kind of money to invest in the people who do most of the actual teaching in the classroom. When you say, ""actual teaching,""ù you mean the grading, follow-up, and supplemental aid in addition to the TEACHING the professors do. The nerve""¶ No, I also mean leading discussion sections (where, in many cases, TAs have to come up with material themselves), where students are actually communicated with directly, and where much actual mastery and comprehension of the material takes place, in addition to holding office hours, where individual student mentorship, not to mention the emotional labor of dealing with students mental health, personal issues, and struggles with the material and with boosting their grades also takes place. TAs have to take on a much more engaged role with students at this point than professors in these classes. There are obviously incredible, engaged""¶†Read more ª Yeah but what they mean it's arrogant of you to call what you do, ""actual teaching,""ù as though to suggest what the professors do isn't. Can you imagine being talked about this way if you went through what you went through to get your degree and find your TA talking this way? It's just disrespectful and could have been better put. Yes, it should have been better worded, and I apologize for that. Like I went on to say, there are incredible professors who are passionate about, and dedicated teachers. I was more talking about those scenarios where, as I said ""professors who don't do much more in these courses, teaching-wise, than lecture the same pre-made lectures they've been using for years (decades, even) for a few hours a week, leave, and use their TAs as human shields to protect them from actually having to deal with students,""ù which academia is unfortunately rife with. Undergrad supporters of the COLA movement have""¶†Read more ª That's part of the training. Faculty only require TAs for one fourth of their teaching load, namely lower-division intro courses. For the rest, they do all the ""actual teaching""ù themselves. I'm faculty at UC and I personally believe sections are a royal waste of time. I make mine optional. The university is doing you a favor by giving grad students the opportunity to learn how to teach in a classroom setting; TAs should be paying for that privilege. Try getting a tenure-track job with no teaching experience. This entire setup exists for the sole purpose of benefiting the grad students""¶†Read more ª Seriously, you're saying that TAs should be PAYING for the ""privilege""ù of working as teaching assistants, so, what, they can graduate and go on to adjunct for peanuts with no benefits and very little hope of getting tenure track? Get a clue. Whatever value you actually see in their labor, I think it's undeniable that they are doing a job that has real monetary value to the university, if just by doing the grunt work that faculty doesn't want to. It's still labor, even if you want to call it ""training""ù which, as in any other industry, still is paid.""¶†Read more ª People who go to law school, med school, trade schools, who get MBAs etc., pay (and take out loans to do so). What TAs do is student work, which is indeed work, but legally very different from wage labor. The University generously sets it up so that TAs get some pay for their training-work and TAs should be aware of that. UCSB is not a nonprofit institutions, so it's not like fat cats are hoarding all the money and intentionally depriving grad students. Staff, lecturers, and faculty, as well as administrators, make less money than they would elsewhere, and everyone""ìor""¶†Read more ª People who go to law school, med school, trade schools, etc. don't work as unpaid instructors at the schools that they attend. Med students get paid for doing residencies, which is ""student work""ù and their ""training""ù for their field. The work that TAs do is separate from their degree- they may sign up for them in GOLD, but those hours don't actually count towards their degree progress. So, it's a completely extraneous job that they're doing to help pay for their degree, but to say that they're just ""being paid to go to school""ù and doing ""student work""ù separate from""¶†Read more ª Sounds like an easy fix. This sounds great! Then you should get paid an hourly rate with fixed work hours commensurate to your experience and the service you provide. The tuition which was paid on your behalf by another entity or source of funds which your university found for you, you can be responsible for, just like the undergrads and the med students you mentioned. In fact, nix that because the work experience gained by serving as teaching assistant which you were once able to place as experience on your resume upon graduating, this experience is ""extraneous""ù as you say""¶†Read more ª Wow. You're in for a surprise when you leave the university bubble and enter the real world. If anyone is willing to hire you, that is, with that attitude. Yes indeed, they can come up with the money ""¶ by raising tuition.  If you think there's another way, you believe in unicorns and pixie dust. $1,800 per month X 3000 grad students X 12 months = +/- $65 million.  The activitists are demanding that the $1,800/mo not be limited only to TA's, but must go to all grad students regardless of whether they work for the University.  Further they demand that it not be allocated based on a needs test.  This demand is in addition to the demand that it not come from a fee increase.   Nope, they demand free money for all, manna from heaven. Don't we all, but some of us live in the real world. It's pretty simple math: they are demanding $1800 (I rounded down) per month for each of about 3000 graduate students.  $1800 times 12 months times 3000 students You said it!  They'll just give them degrees to get the hell out there! Forget the degrees, they should all be fired! From a proud member of the ""Cheadle 57""ù (UCSB 1982): Solidarity to the students occupying Cheadle Hall!! Already forgotten to time Yep, they all become irrelevant eventually.

Correction we are still providing services. What is there to do about the situation of being forced to work while being put at risk?  Our union has done nothing.  You are so quick to critique but have nothing of substance to say I believe the point the OP was trying to make is ""hey, look ""ì everyone is taking off and sheltering at home, but the UC is expecting the folks who are paid the least to be working and exposing themselves.""ù I take this to mean that the lowest paid workers are the most essential workers.  The next time you see someone from the custodial staff or buildings and grounds, please thank them for their valuable work. Every day they help keep the campus safe, clean and beautiful.

The remaining dorm occupants, many of whom are international students who are unable to secure a ticket home, have since been relocated to Santa Catalina Residence Hall, where an ample supply of rooms and less shared space helps maintain social distancing. The housing operation has adopted a number of changes in response to the ongoing pandemic, including the conversion of all dorms into single rooms, partial closure of public spaces and an unlimited, to-go only dining service.

The coronavirus has, however, rendered the threshold between college and the next step in one's life blurred: The commencement speech could be viewed for a month after the end of the quarter, and one could have (and most likely) watched it on the same spot where they had Zoom lectures for spring quarter. As the pandemic forced a change in how to mark one's graduation, the class of 2020 has been creative in the way it said farewell to college. Over the past months, we have collected photos that documented graduation under the special circumstance, from taking graduation photos on a nearly deserted campus to a makeshift graduation ceremony with friends.

Print there goes the rest of our year Truth! Stay-at-home orders don't work, mandatory masks don't work, and politicians are not concerned about anything other than their re-elections. Herd immunity is key. 15-20% of the population must be infected to achieve partial herd immunity as they did in the northeast in the early stages of April. California delayed the spread, but did not eliminate it. CA has seen about 25% of the total covid cases. Ny has seen about 97% because they had their outbreak earlier. Protect those with pre-existing conditions while allowing the general public to live as they please. You aren't accounting for deaths and overrun hospitals on the east coast. Please, do your homework. You are spouting pseudo science. I don't think Cuomo can send senior citizens to IV, and last I checked the average age in IV is about 21.

Graduate students have the maturity to take appropriate measures and act responsibly. However, the push to expand the undergraduate population, and the inclusion of SBCC students has lowered the average level of maturity and eroded the quality of the community.

The town is dominated by students at UCSB and Santa Barbara City College. This young population defines a vibrant culture for Isla Vista, as seen from its residents' obsession with surfing, grab-and-go food, front yard activities and many more essential elements of life there. Although the coronavirus pandemic means most incoming students will begin their journey away from the campus, we hope these photos taken over a 24-hour period can provide a glimpse into the daily life of the community.

Working alongside the fire department was the UC Santa Barbara Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration.† Lagoon Island, along with Campus Point, is a coastal mesa sandwiched between the Santa Barbara Channel and the UCSB campus lagoon, located just south of the main campus. Dominated by a number of exotic species such as non-native annual grasses and ice plants, both mesas have become sites of extensive restoration efforts and research projects. The .36-acre burn was carried out with the aim of suppressing the growth of non-native grasses ""î such as rip-gut brome grass (Bromus diandrus) ""î to benefit native plants such as bluff scrub, according to a press release by the city of Goleta.† This prescribed burn is one component of an ongoing restoration effort. Controlled burns are tools being used to restore the coastal sage scrub and oak woodland habitats that had existed in abundance across much of what later became the UCSB campus. First employed in 2006, the burns curb the growth of non-native grasses through intense heat, which reduces the ""viability of the non-native seed bank,""ù according to the press release.

With remote work, anything is possible! However, the environment in which one attempts to get things done can affect productivity.† The change from in-person classes to online learning has been a challenging transition for most students. For those who are still local and live in Isla Vista, students have found study spaces in pretty much any location where there is WiFi and, when lucky, also charging stations. Nowadays, you'll find students with their laptops in hammocks, on the grass, outside stores with open seatings, on a bed ""î you name it! Sometimes, a change of scenery is what we need to get a little boost of motivation. We've all been there. So if you find yourself around UCSB grounds again, whether you miss the presence or are just trying to get a feel of campus, or if you are looking for an alternate study space to complete your work, check these spots out on campus that have charging stations for your convenience!

To help reduce the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, all faculty, staff, students and visitors are required to wear masks and practice physical distancing in shared indoor spaces. As UC Santa Barbara continues to implement plans for a return to campus for the fall quarter, we are recording how the campus facilities and community are operating. This is also a guide for students on returning to campus in the summer amidst the ongoing pandemic.  All members of the university community who will be on campus or residing in campus-owned housing must complete the daily COVID-19 screening survey through the Student Health Services Gateway Portal. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) Limited study space in the library is open for UCSB students, faculty and staff. Reservations for open study space are not required for UCSB affiliates. All faculty and staff members, students and visitors to campus are required to wear face masks in all shared indoor spaces. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) Individual private study rooms, remote instruction and research spaces, and the Adaptive Technology Center continue to require a reservation. Sanitizing wipes are provided by the library to wipe down workstations before and after use. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) The library services desk remains closed, so users wishing to check out materials should continue using the pickup and mailing service. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) Reservations are no longer required for the Recreation Center (Rec Cen). Face coverings are required in all indoor facilities. Vaccinated individuals are not required to wear face coverings outdoors but must wear face coverings in shared indoor spaces. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) At the Rec Cen, the large and small pools are open for short-course lap swimming throughout all phases and require reservations. Each lane will have a chair on which to place your belongings. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) The Rec Cen's outdoor spaces have been converted into weight and cardio-training fitness areas. Cardio equipment has been positioned on the Multi-Activity Court and in the Robertson Gymnasium. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) COVID-19 testing is available on campus for current students, faculty and staff members. Weekly testing remains required for all unvaccinated undergraduate students living in campus-owned housing, taking in-person classes or labs, working on campus or entering any campus building. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) Testing is provided on weekdays, except on official holidays, at the campus's Loma Pelona Center or in the Linda Vista Room at the Santa Catalina Residence Hall. (Kaiyi Yang / Daily Nexus) Results of asymptomatic COVID-19 tests obtained on campus can be accessed via the same Student Health Service Gateway Portal used to make testing appointments.

photo,Students and County Residents March Against ExxonMobil's New Oil Trucking Plan,3-Oct-21,10:00 AM,['Atmika Iyer'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-03/students-and-county-residents-march-against-exxonmobils-new-oil-trucking-plan/,"In response to ExxonMobil's request to the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission to begin trucking oil on Route 166 and Highway 101, environmental groups across Santa Barbara ""î including several student groups at UC Santa Barbara ""î protested against ExxonMobil by marching from the Santa Barbara County Administration to the Santa Barbara News Press on Sept. 24.†  On Sept. 29, the planning commission ""î†in a 3-2 vote ""î asked its staff to come back with reasons for recommending denial of ExxonMobil's request. The planning commission will hear the findings of the report on Nov. 3.† In early 2020, some of these protesting groups and people ""î many of whom were present at the march ""î formed a coalition called Exxon, Be Gone. This coalition against ExxonMobil's initiatives includes the Sunrise Santa Barbara Movement, California Environmental Justice Alliance, Wishtoyo Chumash Foundation, UCSB Associated Students Environmental Affairs Board, 350 Santa Barbara, Center for Biological Diversity, Environmental Defense Center, Food and Water Action, Get Oil Out, Santa Barbara County Action Network, the Los Padres Chapter of the Sierra Club, the Surfrider Foundation Santa Barbara County Chapter and UCSB External Vice President of Statewide Affairs Esmeralda Quintero-Cubillan.† ExxonMobil's request came to the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission in 2020. The oil corporation hoped to truck oil until they could replace this method with the Plains All American Pipeline for their drilling projects. The pipeline has been non-operational since May 2015, when it leaked into the Santa Barbara Channel. The oil company's initial proposition stated that the trucking would end once a pipeline became available or after a seven-year period, depending on which came first. The trucking path would be from the ExxonMobil Las Flores Canyon facility to either the Phillips 66 Santa Maria Pump Station (SMPS) or the Plains Pentland Terminal and would involve 70 trucks per day, according to the most recent environmental impact report (EIR). Each truck would carry 5,040 to 6,720 gallons of oil.† However, the hearings for the implementation of the trucking path ""î which were supposed to take place on Sept. 2 and Sept. 9, 2020 ""î were delayed because of ExxonMobil's decision to shut down their Santa Maria location in Arroyo Grande by 2023, an obstruction which led to the project's temporary hiatus. Now, ExxonMobil is back with their trucking request to the Santa Barbara Planning Commission, which will be heard Sept. 29 and Oct. 1.† Students and community members at the downtown Santa Barbara march pointed to the orange-tinged skies around them ""î as a result of fires north of Santa Barbara County ""î as an example of what will happen to the environment should companies like ExxonMobil continue their dependency on fossil fuels.† ""There's ash in the sky. The sun looks awful. I feel like this is really telling, seeing this backdrop, the signs we're holding right now, everyone gathered here ""î†it's just a message on how bad climate change has gotten,""ù second-year cultural anthropology major and protest attendee Emily Zomoroudi said.† This slideshow requires JavaScript. The protestors marched through downtown Santa Barbara chanting, ""No more Exxon, no more oil. Keep the carbon in the soil,""ù ""Climate change is not a lie. Do not let our planet die,""ù and ""Hey hey, ho ho, ExxonMobil's got to go.""ù† This slideshow requires JavaScript. According to third-year environmental studies major and Environmental Affairs Board (EAB) Co-Chair Kat Lane, the Society of Fearless Grandmothers Santa Barbara ""î who coordinated the protest ""î reached out to environmental advocacy student groups at UCSB for their help in demonstrating against ExxonMobil's trucking proposal. Lane and other students then sent information on the protest to professors teaching classes on environmental studies and advertised the protest on social media.† ""We're out here today not only because oil is going to be detrimental to our environment, but also because this is a water issue. It's an issue about people getting access to clean water, to clean food, it's about respecting the Chumash indigenous wishes,""ù Lane said.†† Fourth-year biochemistry and environmental studies double major and EAB member Soham Ray said that the EAB has been keeping track of EIRs and general updates with ExxonMobil's proposal. Ray said this project is dangerous for the county in multiple ways.† ""The trucking project in general is dangerous for Santa Barbara, for the Santa Barbara locals, and also, the youth. Our community [and] the world should be focused on taking climate change seriously, and making sure that companies that contributed the most to this problem like Exxon[Mobil] don't continue to pull oil out of the ground and burn it down just to meet their bottom line,""ù Ray said.† Ray added that he hopes big corporations and politicians hear students' messages and outcry against ExxonMobil's trucking plan.† ""Students are serious because this is our future and we have to care about it. We can't just allow big corporations or politicians ""î†like the planning commission ""î†decide on if we get to have a liveable future or not. It's up to us to communicate to [big corporations and politicians] and help them understand that this is our future we're fighting for,""ù he said.†† Nadia Abushanab,†UCSB 2020 alumna, was also at the protest as an organizer with the Santa Barbara County Action Network. Abushanab said that there are three primary points the action network hopes to convey.† ""The first is that climate change is real, and we cannot afford to drill any more oil ""¶ The second one is that an oil spill is a real possibility that could happen. In the last five years, there have been five oil spills on the route they want to truck oil on, and it's right next to the river. We can't afford to harm our ecosystem, our marine life or wildlife,""ù Abushanab said. ""The third thing is that that road is very dangerous. So much so that the staff [report] actually recommended against it in their recommendation last year.""ù† The Environmental Defense Center (EDC), a group within the coalition, has been providing ""substantive analysis of the scientific information, [and] the legal analysis on the technical information,""ù according to Exxon, Be Gone member and Chief Counsel for the Environmental Defense Center Linda Krop. Krop expressed concern over the initial EIR, which only asked that trucking be suspended during rainy periods.† The EDC researched accidents in Santa Barbara County and California involving oil trucking from 2000 and discovered accidents ""involving explosions, spills [and] injuries.""ù The EDC noted that many of the accidents were the result of other cars crashing into the truck, and not the other way around. Throughout all of their research, they discovered around 70 accidents involving the rain. Krop emphasized that just because there was rain in a few accidents, that doesn't mean that the weather was ""necessarily related""ù to the cause or impact of the accident.† The original staff report for the SBCPC, however, went further to then recommend that Route 166 be excluded from the trucking request. Unlike the EIR, the report looked at the likelihood of accidents on Route 166 specifically and saw that the likelihood of an accident on this route is greater than what the EIR calculated. This is because the EIR used national averages for their analysis of likelihood of accidents, instead of accidents on Route 166 specifically. The most recent staff report, however, does not ask for Route 166 to be excluded.† The EDC recently published a blog post outlining the dangers of allowing ExxonMobil to truck oil in Santa Barbara County, which explained that there have been at least 79 tanker crashes in California during the last 21 years. The accidents have resulted in the death of 28 people and the injuries of 56. Over 100,000 gallons of oil were spilled leading to the impairment of several ecosystems.†† The EDC also pointed out in the blog post that there was an oil spill as recently as March 21, 2020 where a tanker truck on Route 166 was overturned ""causing 6,600 gallons of crude oil to spill into the Cuyama River, ten miles away from Twitchell Dam and reservoir. The spill harmed wildlife, as several mallard ducks died and other animals, including turtles and birds, were rescued and cleaned up.""ù The Nexus will continue reporting on the county's decision regarding a potential, new trucking plan for ExxonMobil in Santa Barbara County.† A version of this article appeared on p. 4 of the Sept. 23, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The local marches ""î†organized by the Women's March organization ""î†took place in downtown Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. UC Santa Barbara students primarily attended the march in downtown Santa Barbara.†  Students, county residents and local politicians all gathered at De La Guerra Plaza at noon prior to the march. World Dance for Humanity danced to various famous anthems of female empowerment, including Aretha Franklin's ""Respect""ù and Meghan Trainor's ""Woman Up.""ù Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus After the dancers dispersed, local advocates spoke to the crowd about the importance of reproductive rights. Speakers included Annette Cordero of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, State Senator Monique Lim√≥n, Central Coast Planned Parenthood CEO Jenna Tosh and former State Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson.† Cordero stood in front of the crowd alongside her family members and other members of the Coastal Band and discussed the importance of inclusivity and addressing intersectionality within advocacy for reproductive rights.† Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus ""We want to make sure that we are inclusive, that we include queer [people], the whole gambit of LGBTQIA[+]. In our tradition, two-spirited people were usually honored and considered highly respected members of our community, so we also want to make sure that we honor two-spirited people,""ù Cordero said.† Cordero's niece Kelly added to the discussion of inclusivity and intersectionality within advocacy for reproductive rights.† ""Not all people with uteruses are women,""ù Kelly said. ""Not all pussies are pink either. We're here in solidarity because they're trying to take control of us, and it's not going to happen.""ù† Lim√≥n's speech discussed the impact of the new Texas law on the residents of the state. Lim√≥n shared the story of a pregnant woman whose child has anencephaly ""î a fatal condition where the child is missing parts of its brain. The mother was unable to get an abortion in Texas and had to fly out of state, NPR reported.† Pia Ramos / Daily Nexus ""We know for a fact that [the new Texas law] will not reduce abortions, that this will reduce safe abortions and require women to seek unsafe alternatives,""ù Lim√≥n said. ""This is the reality of what is at stake.""ù† Lim√≥n added that in 2021, ""over 600 laws restricting abortions have been introduced in this country.""ù† Tosh followed Lim√≥n's speech, highlighting the various laws and restrictions on abortion throughout the country.† Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus ""Roe v. Wade is hanging on by a thread. Abortion is effectively illegal in a U.S. state for the first time since 1973. In December, the Supreme Court will hear a direct attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade,""ù Tosh said. ""If they do overturn it, 26 states will likely ban abortion before the end of next year. These states are home to 36 million women of reproductive age and even more trans men and gender nonconforming and nonbinary people who stand to lose their constitutional right to a safe and legal abortion.""ù† ""Nearly half of U.S. people who can become pregnant could lose their reproductive rights overnight,""ù Tosh continued.† Next was Jackson, who discussed the Supreme Court's regard for stare decisis ""î†a legal doctrine requiring courts to abide by the precedent set by previous cases. In this situation, the set precedent would be from Roe v. Wade.† Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus ""So what do we do? We have a Supreme Court now that has disrespected the notion of what they call stare decisis ""î†accepting the laws that existed. We knew this was going to happen,""ù Jackson said. ""The senate at the time allowed sexual harassers on the court, they allowed people who have lied and committed perjury in their hearings saying they would honor stare decisis and they have not. We need to take action.""ù† After all the speeches, the marchers, including UCSB students, took to State Street ""î†chanting and marching to the end of Anapamu Street right by the Santa Barbara County Administration Building.† ""I've been studying history a lot, especially repressed and totalitarian environments. And I don't want to live in one, to be honest,""ù said first-year economics major and march attendee Dexter Laviolette. ""I think we should do everything we can to make sure we preserve our freedoms and rights, whether they're legal or not.""ù ""We should remember that everything the government does anywhere is with the consent of the governed,""ù he continued. ""As long as we stay conscious and do not give them our consent, they cannot do anything we don't want them to.""ù Carly Lankarani, a first-year history of art and architecture major who attended the march with LaViolette, concurred that students and community members alike should remain aware of current events and advocate for women's rights.† ""I'm just staying aware of current issues. Do your part, if you're able to, go out and vote; if not, pre-register to vote, just pay attention to politics, do what you can on campus, or even, like, your local community, make sure the word gets out,""ù she said.† ""Women's rights are human rights. Don't forget it.""ù† In an interview with the Nexus, Lim√≥n congratulated high school- and college-aged marchers for being civically engaged and fighting for their rights.† ""Kudos, kudos for caring about your rights now, whether you can vote or not. It's about caring, and ensuring that your voice ""î†because you're the next generation of leaders ""î†is represented at the table,""ù Lim√≥n said. ""So thank you to all of the women ""î†young and older and everything in between ""î who have showed up [and] to the allies because it's about showing that this community is backing reproductive health choices.""ù † A version of this article appeared on p. 5 of the Oct. 7, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

These tokens symbolize home and the mark of another journey in her life. However, there is more behind the story of why and how she began. Amelia Busenhart, Santa Cruz native, sociology major and now a UCSB alumna as of fall 2021, is the founder of Cimelia Creations. She customizes rings, necklaces and earrings and has shared her passion for crafting while maintaining an environmentally friendly process. (Sydney Haupt / Daily Nexus) ""I've always loved crafting and I'm grateful for the ability to be able to use my hands. With anything, if I can make it or build it myself, whether it's a desk or just DIY something, I [would] rather just do that,""ù Busenhart shared.  Busenhart sources her jewelry stones from various markets and fairs. She uses a variety of tools, including a blowtorch and sets of pliers, for her work. (Sydney Haupt / Daily Nexus) As her small business grew, Busenhart has connected with organizations that her goals align with. One of her main goals is to make a meaningful impact in the world. She has donated to organizations like the Sunrise Movement which combats climate change while creating millions of jobs throughout the process. One of Busenhart's sales was in response to the CZU Lightning Complex fires in which 100% of proceeds went to fire relief.† In celebration of her small business' one year, Cimelia Creations planted 50 trees in California through the nonprofit One Tree Planted. The goal was to offset all carbon emissions produced in the first year. In addition, they switched to ""100% recycled padded mailers from EcoEnclose which is made of upcycled newspaper and recycled Kraft paper that naturally degrades in a few weeks.""ù  The process of making jewelry pieces depends on the item; Busenhart said earrings take her about 20 minutes, as opposed to rings, which involve a lengthier process. (Sydney Haupt / Daily Nexus) Growing up, Busenhart shared that her mom traveled a lot and would return with souvenirs of jewelry for her. Aside from travels, when Busenhart reached milestones in her life, her mom would pass on a piece of jewelry that came from the places and people she loved. Today, Busenhart has carried on this memorabilia with her love for the ocean.† ""I never really wear makeup because I spend a lot of time in the ocean, so jewelry became that piece that I would wear,""ù Busenhart said. ""It's a way for me to feel good about myself, to feel confident and just be kind to people in the water, and I hope that's how others feel when they wear my jewelry as well.""ù  A necklace and bracelet gifted to Busenhart by her mother. Busenhart said she finds inspiration going about her day-to-day life and will seek creatives from those who inspire her, like her mom. (Sydney Haupt / Daily Nexus) Busenhart also emphasized the importance of supporting female businesses in a post she shared on Instagram: ""By supporting women-owned businesses you are a part of the dismantlement of occupational segregation! You are putting women in a place of power! You are supporting the creation of a web of BADASS FEMALE mentoring relationships, training opportunities and a more equal distribution of women in the workforce!""ù  Busenhart often posts on her Instagram story, naming it ""Shop my Story""ù where her followers are able to tap through the pieces and swipe up to message her about items that they would like to purchase. Her stories are up for 24 hours and are still visible throughout her Instagram page as highlighted stories. (Sydney Haupt / Daily Nexus) To view Busenhart's products and shop her business, visit @cimelia.creations on Instagram. Stay tuned for her upcoming website!  Busenhart shares how she is still figuring out her pricing since she wants to make her items super affordable. She says that she is not trying to think about the cost, but more so whether or not she likes the products she creates.

photo,In Photos | Perspectives on Lunar New Year,1-Feb-22,9:56 AM,['Daily Nexus Photography'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-02-01/in-photos-perspectives-on-lunar-new-year/,"The 2022 Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Jan. 31, marked the beginning of a new year in the traditional lunar calendar used in East Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Vietnam. Lunar New Year is a time of family reunion. Everyone returns home for the holiday, prepares dinner with their family and sends their best wishes to relatives and friends. However, instead of celebrating with family abroad, Asian international students usually have to stay in the U.S. and celebrate with their friends. As Lunar New Year's Day took place during midterms week, the festival was a frantic mix of coursework and celebrations. Since Lunar New Year's Eve was on a Monday, most students decided to have the ""Reunion Dinner""ù over the preceding weekend. Furthermore, Lunar New Year traditions are slightly different between northern China and southern China, making Lunar New Year celebrations among the Chinese international students their own standalone exchange of customs. Over the past week, the Nexus collected photos documenting what Lunar New Year looked like for UC Santa Barbara's international students. As one of the most important holidays in the international student community, Lunar New Year is an iconic event that strengthens the connections among international students. In the photo story below, each photographer described their picture in their own words. †

				Preparation of the New Year's Eve dinner feast is a demanding process. A vast amount of dishes are to be cooked, with some even having symbolic significance: Fish represents prosperity, and dumplings symbolize wealth as they resemble ancient gold ingots.

The university conducted remote instruction for a month due to the rise in COVID-19 cases. UCSB's campus ""î which remained mostly empty during the beginning of this quarter with the exception of university housing, dining halls and a few other facilities ""î was bustling with activity as in-person classes resumed for Week 5.† Full reopening of the campus was initially slated for Jan 18., but was delayed an additional two weeks until Jan. 31, with the decision to hold in-person classes left to instructors. While some protested the idea of anything other than in-person classes, many were apprehensive at the idea of returning to campus at all given surging cases of the COVID-19 omicron variant.† Precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including the indoor mask mandate, remain in place, along with an additional requirement that all students eligible for a booster vaccination must receive one by the first day of in-person instruction. The return to in-person instruction consisted of packed walkways and crowded bike lanes, as thousands of students breathed life into a campus that lay dormant for the better part of seven weeks.

With the omicron variant limiting what students were able to achieve during the first half of the winter quarter, as well as a large number of our students studying at home, the vitality of Isla Vista was disappearing. However, now that midterm season has begun and the first week of in-person classes has just concluded, the sounds of I.V. have definitely increased. Here's an inside look at I.V. nightlife as seen through the eyes of UC Santa Barbara students. It's made up of a collection of stories and activities that a few of our I.V. students love doing in their spare time. These different stories and activities range from mountain parties to backyard music concerts to simply just Del Playa madness.  (Joela Rodriguez and Ewa Zakrzewska \ Daily Nexus)

UCSB art professor Kim Yasuda and UCSB Event Coordinator Susan Yamashiro have also assisted the pair in their endeavors.† Stewart, who teaches ""History of Jazz,""ù holds the jazz coffeehouse in tandem with his class and said he always likes to start with a band that showcases the blues.† ""When I teach my class, I start out with something from the blues because the blues is really the foundation of jazz,""ù Stewart said. Stewart added that Morganfield Burnett & Da Blues reminds him of the music from Chicago, where Stewart grew up.† ""He reminds me of where I grew up. I grew up in Chicago, and he plays a version that we heard called Chicago blues, particularly [with] the harmonica,""ù Stewart said. ""It really bridged a number of worlds: the blues world, the jazz world, but also the electric rock world of the 1960s.""ù† Stewart said that the COVID-19 pandemic made organizing jazz coffeehouses very difficult. However, once Chancellor Henry T. Yang announced that students would return back to in-person instruction on Jan. 31, Stewart said he realized it was time to bring back the local jazz coffeehouse. The event followed COVID-19 protocols of masking and social distancing.† ""I thought this would be a good way to get people excited about coming back,""ù Stewart said. ""I think it lifted everybody's spirits, at least lifted mine, and the music was really fantastic ""¶ It was low-key compared to earlier ones because we didn't really have that many people. But it was very festive and a lot of fun.""ù† In July 2021, Stewart and Rios were selected as MacArthur Foundation chairs ""î†a position that allows both to receive funding from the interest accrued by a $1 million endowment for their research project to expand their operations.† Stewart and Rios told the Independent in July that they hope to take their jazz coffeehouse to a few locations in California ""î including Oakland and Los Angeles ""î in the hopes of establishing a connection with youth who may feel as though they don't have a place at a higher education institution like UCSB.† The continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic has halted some of those plans as the professors also consider how a large congregation might impact transmission. However, Stewart said he hopes to restart these plans during Spring Quarter 2022.† ""What I'm hoping is that [expansion] will be something that I can get into in the spring if omicron continues to abate because I really didn't want to have events where large numbers of people would congregate,""ù Stewart said. ""In Southern California, especially down in Los Angeles County, [there has been a] high rate of COVID. Until I'm sure that it's safe to do so, that's been on pause. It's still going to happen. But we have to wait until we're really sure that we're out of the woods on COVID.""ù† The next pop-up jazz coffeehouse will be held on March 4 at the Isla Vista Community Center with the jazz band Boplicity. For those who cannot attend the event in person, the music will also be livestreamed.† (Atmika Iyer / Daily Nexus)

photo,In Photos | Isla Vista Surfing Culture,26-Apr-22,8:32 PM,['Daily Nexus Photography'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-26/in-photos-isla-vista-surfing-culture/,"A cornerstone of UC Santa Barbara and Isla Vista culture has always been the presence of a large surfing community. The Daily Nexus captured photos from Southern California surf spots, including Sands Beach, Devereux Beach, ""Little Rincon""ù and Campus Point, showcasing the different offerings of certain beaches and wave conditions. Campus Point is a popular spot for surfing in Isla Vista due to the generally small, mellow waves. However, with the right swell direction, the waves can be larger and better. Sands Beach is much more of a shortboard break with its many punchy beachbreak peaks up and down the beach. Pictured here is a nice A-frame peak a ways down the beach. (Pablo Van Dyck / The Daily Nexus) The sandbars and reefs at Sands Beach combine to make the waves steeper than at Campus Point and Devereux Beach, attracting a much larger crowd of shortboarders. The steeper waves result in better opportunities for big carves and aerial maneuvers. (Pablo Van Dyck / The Daily Nexus) Sometimes at the right tide and surf conditions, Sands Beach can have some really nice barrel sections. (Pablo Van Dyck / The Daily Nexus) Just 20 minutes south of Isla Vista via the 101 lies the ""Queen of the Coast.""ù Rincon Point is the best point break in California, maybe even the entire West Coast [[west coast]] and is the proving grounds for the best surfers that come out of the Santa Barbara area. Minute-long long rides and enough turns to make your legs burn are the norm on a good day at Rincon. Just to the south of Rincon Point is the oftentimes overlooked break known as Mussel Shoals Beach or ""Little Rincon.""ù This spot is like Rincon's lesser known little brother. With plenty of opportunities for turns and barrels, this spot is a favorite for my friends and I for surfing outside of Isla Vista. (Pablo Van Dyck / The Daily Nexus) Little Rincon is easily distinguishable by the pier leading out to the oil island just offshore. (Pablo Van Dyck / The Daily Nexus) Little Rincon has three main sections: Upper Point, Middle Point and Lower Point Pictured here is a surfer cruising through a section at Middle Point.

(Pablo Van Dyck / The Daily Nexus) Further south of Rincon and Little Rincon is another popular spot for surfers from the Isla Vista area, Ventura Point. While a bit more of a drive, surfers who make the journey down there are often rewarded with larger waves and a more spread-out crowd than at places like Rincon or Little Rincon. (Pablo Van Dyck / The Daily Nexus) Ventura Point features a very nice point break that is more exposed to swells coming from the west and the north than surf breaks further north in Santa barbara.

photo,In Photos | The Experience of Studying Abroad in Europe,25-Jan-23,8:55 PM,['Pablo Van Dyck'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-01-25/in-photos-the-experience-of-studying-abroad-in-europe/,"For some students, studying abroad represents an opportunity to enhance one's experience within their major by studying it from a new perspective in a new country. However, for others, studying abroad is an opportunity to take a break from their degree path to experience and study a new culture somewhere else in the world. With this choice comes the amazing opportunity to be immersed in a new culture and also travel to new places when there is time. This photo story is a photographic representation of one way that studying abroad can be experienced and includes photos from a number of different places across Europe, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Rome.† This photo features the symbol of the Renaissance, Filippo Brunelleschi's Duomo. Florence is a relatively small but very culturally important city in the Tuscany region of Italy. Often called the origin of the Renaissance, Florence has maintained its importance throughout history and is one of the most visited places in Italy. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Just a three-hour train ride from Florence out to the coast is Cinque Terre National Park. Cinque Terre presents amazing views that visitors have to earn through hiking a steep, strenuous trail. The trail connects the five towns and goes along the rugged mountains that rise up from the ocean. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Barcelona is a city located in the northeast of Spain in the Catalonia region and is one of the largest cities in Europe by population. It features both Catalan and Spanish cultures. This photo is the view from some old World War II/Spanish Civil War bunkers atop a hill on the outskirts of the city. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Copenhagen, Denmark, is one of the largest cities in Scandinavia. The city is known for the good quality of life for its residents, who are sometimes considered the happiest people on Earth, as well as its beautiful parks and public spaces. This photo is from a rainy day on one of the main pedestrian streets in the city center. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Paris, France, has many well-known sites, such as the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame. However, they are generally packed with tourists. In order to escape the madness around the main sites and get a true Parisian experience, visitors can walk up into the different neighborhoods that comprise the city. This photo is of a street in the Montmartre neighborhood which is the area around the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Rome features a mesh of Renaissance and ancient Roman historical sites. Rome is also the only city to have a fully autonomous city-state entirely within its city limits, the Vatican City. This photo is from the Roman Forum, a large remaining area of ancient Roman ruins in the middle of Rome. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) After an hourlong bus from Castellammare di Stabia to the small town of Bomerano in the mountains of Amalfi, travelers are rewarded with Il Sentiero degli Dei (The Path of the Gods). This trail is world renowned for its stunning views of the town of Positano and the Amalfi Coast. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Siena is a hilly city in the Tuscan countryside. This photo is the view from a castle in the hills outside of the city and features the massive expanse of rolling hills dotted with vineyards and olive groves that the region is known for. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) In Brussels, Belgium, both Dutch and French are spoken, and the city features aspects of both countries. The city is renowned for its chocolate and beer, both of which are extremely popular with tourists. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, was established when the Amstel River was dammed in Medieval Times. This photo shows one of the many canals that comprise the city and features the typical canal houses that make up much of the residential areas. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) There is so much more to studying abroad than simply studying in a new country. Whether it be the unique classes that are offered or the opportunity to live in a new country and travel to surrounding areas, studying abroad presents a different way to experience a semester or year of college. The best part is that it is different for everyone. These photos represent one journey to many different parts of Europe while doing a program in Florence, Italy. This is in no way an advertisement for UC Education Abroad Program; this is a photographic representation of one possible way of many to study abroad.

photo,In Photos | Bomb Cyclone Swell,21-Mar-23,7:32 PM,['Pablo Van Dyck'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-03-21/in-photos-bomb-cyclone-swell/,"Santa Barbara is known for having many near-perfect right hand point breaks that rarely break. The combination of the generally south-facing coastline and the swell blocking of the Channel Islands means that many surf spots on the Santa Barbara South Coast need very specific swell conditions to even have breaking waves. When the January 2023 bomb cyclone started making its way towards the California coast, the buoy swell readings were in uncharted territory, the biggest readings ever recorded. The surf community was buzzing with rumors that this swell was going to be something special. As the first day of the swell arrived, the waves were huge but the winds were also very strong, meaning conditions were generally unsurfable. Except at one spot: Sandspit. The sandbar created by the jetty that shields Santa Barbara Harbor is the ultimate novelty wave. Facing almost southeast, the spit needs a very large west/west-southwest swell to break. The result is that it breaks only a handful of days each year on average and only has really good conditions on a handful of days each decade. The bomb cyclone swell saw the biggest waves ever seen at Sandspit and had the locals in a frenzy. The photos and videos quickly made their rounds on social media and the mass exodus to Santa Barbara was on for day two of the swell. Day two brought smaller waves than day one. However, the wind was much lighter and had a more favorable direction than the day before, which meant that surfers from Point Conception down into Baja California saw some of the best waves in recent history. Large, long period west swell awakens waves like El Capitan that do not break very often and attract large crowds. Day two was one of the best days seen at El Capitan in years despite the brown water. The weather was sunny, the winds stayed light and offshore, and the waves were nearly perfect. January 5, 2022 will go down as the biggest day at Sandspit at the mouth of Santa Barbara Harbor in recent history. It was not perfect by any means, as a lot of the waves were simply too big, but every so often a perfect wave would come through, and one lucky surfer would score the wave of their life. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) The waves were breaking past the breakwater that protects the Santa Barbara Harbor and reverberating off the rocks to create huge backwash flares (pictured here). (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) There were also waves breaking next to Stearns Wharf, sometimes even splashing over the pier. This is a rare occurrence, as normally the water is too deep for waves to break in that spot. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) With such a large crowd in the water and the visibly strong current, it was very hard to catch waves. However, if you did, you were rewarded. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) Pictured here is the line to paddle out.Surfing Sandspit when it is big can be complicated, but experienced surfers know the drill. Many spectators watched as surfers would catch a wave, go into the beach, walk back up the spit, wait in line for their turn to paddle back out to the lineup, and repeat. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) On this day, the icing on the cake was the beautiful sunset that cast golden light into the lineup from over the Santa Barbara mesa. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) On the second day of the swell, Jan. 6, a different fickle (needing very specific swell and weather conditions to have waves) point break up the Gaviota Coast was buzzing with energy as according to the many surfers and spectators on the beach, it was the best it's been in years. The energy on the beach at El Capitan was buzzing with activity as the crowd cheered as surfers traded off heavy barrels that churned down the point. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) This photo is a prime example of what the better waves were looking like at El Capitan: thick, chocolate milk like barrels. (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus) The water may have looked gross, but at a spot like El Capitan breaks so rarely that the surfers did not mind! Many of the surfers had made a long trip from north or south to escape less than ideal surf conditions, and they were all scoring some of the best waves seen at this spot in recent history. The hype stayed strong throughout the day! (Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus)

photo,In Photos: Italian Cooking Night,26-Apr-23,7:25 PM,['Jerry Huang'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-26/in-photos-italian-cooking-night/,"With rain drizzling outside and warm light aglow, the UC Santa Barbara Italian Club hosted an Italian cooking night with Katie's FUNd Program in collaboration with Chef Dario Furlati from the restaurant Ca'Dario. The event was held at the Alpha Resource Center and brought over 60 people together from the UCSB community, the special needs youth community from Katie's FUNd and gracious helpers at the center.† The event was organized by professor Carla Borromeo, a lecturer in the French and Italian department and the faculty advisor for the club, along with the club's president Thomas Lloyd, vice president Manuel Rodriguez and treasurer Piya Rao. ""The mission of the UCSB Italian Club,""ù said Professor Borromeo, ""is to actively re-connect the Italian student community at UCSB, and make a positive impact both within and beyond the campus, after the extended pause caused by COVID-19.""ù The club resumed their monthly meetings, which perform outreach to the Santa Barbara community by involving the students to help local organizations and raise money for important causes. The Italian Club's motto is that everybody is welcome, and they have organized successful events such as arts and crafts night, cards night, Tombola night and soon they will hold karaoke and dance nights.† Borromeo and McKenna Robles, the coordinator of Katie's FUNd, have spent time getting to know each other and setting up this event. In the event, each participant was paired with a student of Katie's FUNd to learn how to prepare a complete Italian dinner following the direction of Furlati and his assistant Constancio Gomez. ""I am thrilled with the idea of an Italian cooking night, especially because the kids from Katie's could interact and be paired with people of their same age group!""ù said Robles. Katie's FUND was established at Alpha Resource Center of Santa Barbara by the Janeway Family in July 2003. It honors the determination and passion for the life of Katie Janeway, a 14-year-old with developmental disabilities who died while attending a camp in 2002. Katie's FUNd provides social and recreational activities for teens and young adults through the programs Teen Extreme and EXPO. Teen Extreme is for junior high, high school and transition students, typically aged 13 to 22. EXPO is for young adults, typically aged 22 to 35. Participants in the programs assist in selecting activities and special events. They also choose from a range of community activities each month.† The event started with a welcome speech from Borromeo and Furlati. ""Food is a big part of the Italian culture and ""¶ eating is a beautiful form of unity many people forget,""ù said Borromeo. Borromeo and Furlati open the night with a welcome speech. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) † Borromeo and Furlati welcome everyone to the kitchen. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) † Borromeo, Furlati and Robles discuss the night. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) Later, everyone gathered in the kitchen as Furlati guided them in preparing the ""primo piatto,""ù or first course. They first learned how to make the dough for tagliatelle in green, red and white, meant to symbolize the Italian flag. The pasta was served with a choice of traditional ragu sauce or with olive oil and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.† Furlati and his assistant teach everyone how to make the dough.

(Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) † Robles celebrates and documents the process of dough making by taking a picture. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) † Rao has a conversation about her favorite part of the evening. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) UCSB professors and students helped plate and serve the pasta. Italian Club members and youth from Katie's FUNd enjoyed eating the pasta dishes together while also engaging in activities like coloring Italian flags and arts and crafts. The vibrant ambiance was complemented by the cheerful Italian music that filled the air. Students enjoyed the pasta they had made themselves, each bite filled with freshly cooked tagliatelle and flavorful ragu sauce.† Students enjoy coloring while waiting for the pasta.

(Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) As a side dish, the group also prepared a traditional Italian salad, but everyone was especially excited about the dessert: sfogliatelle with zabaglione cream and frutti di bosco (a mix of various berries), a traditional Italian dessert. Furlati shows students how to prepare the dessert. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) After the dinner ended, Furlati and his assistant Gomez walked around the room, making sure that everyone had enough food and answering questions about the recipes. Each participant had the opportunity to also bring home their own dough to remake the dish. Afterward, members of the Italian Club helped the chef clean up the kitchen. Italian club member Deisy Novoa, professor Valentina Padula and Rodriguez help Furlati clean up the kitchen. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) Everyone left with a sense of accomplishment and a full stomach. The members of Italian Club had achieved their goal of not only sharing the Italian language and culture, but also leaving a positive impact on the Santa Barbara community by collaborating with Katie's FUNd. The event was an excellent example of how students from different ages and backgrounds can come together to learn and have fun while supporting a good cause. As the rain continued to fall outside, the students from Italian Club and the youth from Katie's FUNd took a group photo and said their goodbyes, promising to stay in touch and to meet again soon. The Italian cooking night was a memorable experience for everyone involved, and it showed that even in difficult times it is possible to come together, have fun and make a positive impact in the world. A group picture is taken before the event concludes, featuring all the participants, chefs and professors. (Jerry Huang / Daily Nexus) Borromeo and the Italian Club are already planning their next event. They are determined to make a difference in the community and to share their passion for Italian culture and language with as many people as possible. The Italian Club is open to everyone, regardless of their background or level of knowledge, and they are always looking for new members who share their enthusiasm.

The two who showed attendees how to prepare both a vegetarian and a meat-based kimchi. Stephanie Luong, a third-year biochemistry major and author of the ""Asian Recipe Cookbook""ù pamphlet was inspired to share her recipes in an effort to encourage cultural diversity on campus and help students feel represented and capable of cooking their favorite cultural recipes. Luong focuses on encouraging cultural richness at UC Santa Barbara through improving food access and fighting food insecurity.
""By hosting this event, I was hoping to show students that there are amenities and resources available to them to make UCSB their home away from home,""ù Luong said..
In the introduction to her cookbook, Luong explains how she turns to food and cooking to connect with her cultural roots and her family, but most importantly, foster a sense of home. Co-leader Leanne Ly is a third-year environmental studies major and is currently working as a food, nutrition, basic needs & health equity intern at UCSB Health & Wellness. Ly hopes to help students feel their best at UCSB by encouraging cultural representation and accessibility to traditional ethnic experiences.
""When you cook a family recipe, you are learning cultural traditions and connecting to your roots. When you share a meal, you are making connections and building relationships,""ù Ly said in relation to how food and the process of cooking can allow people to feel connected and integrate their cultures. Luong's Asian Recipe Cookbook explores Asian grocery stores and restaurants in Goleta. ""I hope that when you try these recipes, you're not only cooking a wonderful meal, but you're also taken back to your home ""î a place or feeling of community and inclusivity,""ù Luong wrote.

photo,In Photos | Gregory Alan Isakov at The Arlington Theatre,9-Apr-24,8:15 PM,"['Ella Bailey', 'Tyler Janous']",https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-09/in-photos-gregory-alan-isakov-at-the-arlington-theatre/,"Indie-rock and folk artist Gregory Alan Isakov performed at Santa Barbara's Arlington Theater on March 8, 2024 while on tour for his newest album, ""Appaloosa Bones.""ù† The show was opened by Seattle-born folk artist Damien Jurado. Jurado was accompanied only by a pianist, which showcased his unique and visually complex lyricism. His songs are reminiscent of stripped-down poetry and encapsulate longing in a beautifully reflective way. This misty set prepared the scene for the strong ringing out of Isakov's folk sound. When Isakov entered the stage, he was illuminated by a single stage light from above, and the crowd roared. Isakov's harmonious songs resonated throughout the entire space of the venue as blue, red and yellow colors of light reached out toward the audience. Isakov's harrowing voice and guitar complemented the various bluesy elements of the band. Throughout the show, there were soaring performances by the band on the banjo, bass, harmonica, accordion, violin and drums. Each element of the band felt essential to the songs presented, and the lighting from above highlighted each member's importance. Gregory Alan Isakov stands center stage as the rest of his band plays around him. (Tyler Janous / Daily Nexus) In between songs, Isakov talked about how he and his band are from Colorado, whilst presenting lyrics of natural landscapes and images of home. The lyrics and landscape visuals invited the audience to experience a sense of travel and finding where one belongs. The entire show was a journey ""î whether Isakov was singing about tall grass, open fields or the ocean tide, he showed that the narrator was looking for something to hold on to. It is easy to get lost in the beauty of the works presented because they feel like a tether to what you love; this is shown in the title track of the new album, where Isakov sings, ""glad you found me when you did.""ù† Isakov's most popular song, ""Big Black Car,""ù was performed, showcasing an interesting connection between the band and the audience. The song opens with ""You were a phonograph, I was a kid,""ù which shows how one admires just humbly listening to someone talk. A phonograph, or a vessel of music, being much older than a kid ever could be. Watching the band shine onstage while the audience stared in awe was very reflective of this perspective. Folk as a genre would be the age-old tradition of storytelling through song that people today are so fortunate to experience. Gregory Alan Isakov performs a solo on his banjo. (Tyler Janous / Daily Nexus) Gregory Alan Isakov (left) and Jeb Bows (right) perform song Dark, Dark, Dark. (Tyler Janous / Daily Nexus) The highlight of the night, however, was the encore. Isakov's band all congregated in a huddle at the front center of the stage, encircled by rays of golden light. The band swayed back and forth as one unit to their hit, ""Second Chances,""ù which was a beacon of hope. It was reminiscent of how folk music was started and continues to be played today ""î in small bars and venues where a small group of people come together to share their stories. The scene was similar to that of a Renaissance artwork of heavenly embrace, specifically Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Ecstasy of Saint Teresa. It was a vision of artistic beauty that the crowd was enraptured by.† The crowd watches as the band performs The Stable Song. (Tyler Janous / Daily Nexus) Jeb Bows plays a solo during the encore. (Tyler Janous / Daily Nexus) What was most exciting about this performance, as with folk performances in general, was the embrace of the human experience. Folk music captures what it feels like to be taken aback by the beauty of life and feel this humility that reminds the listeners to let go of what hinders them from enjoying it. Isakov reminds you of what places, what people you care about the most and what it feels like to experience that love. So sit back, relax, put on some Isakov one evening and enjoy looking at the stars with the people you love. Steve Varney sings backup vocals while playing the keys.

Not only does the organization focus on cooking education, but they also work with local organizations, such as the Associated Students (A.S.) Food Bank, to provide cost-free meals and ingredients to students. In an effort to provide easily accessible, prepared meals for students on campus, Health & Wellness has been running multiple programs such as Wellness Soup Wednesdays, Wellness Rice and Beans, Monday Morning Oats and International Tea Time. These programs typically start as pilot programs, and while Monday Morning Oats will no longer be running, Wellness Rice and Beans will be expanded this quarter to provide more pre-made bowls at times beyond the few that were previously offered, increasing availability of this resource to students. Not only does this program aim to give students grab-and-go meals that are more substantial than snacks, but it will also educate students about potential recipes they could implement using the rice and beans often provided at the A.S. Food Bank. Wellness Soup Wednesday is a partnership between Health & Wellness and the Organic Soup Company. International Tea Time is aimed at connecting international students over a relaxing ritual. Anya Yu-Swanson (left) and Adrianna (right) enjoy warm bowls of oatmeal at the SRB. (Daily Nexus / Nina Timofeyeva) With a variety of toppings available, students could customize their oatmeal to their taste. (Daily Nexus / Nina Timofeyeva) According to Mallory Russell, the Health & Wellness health education generalist, the Health & Wellness programs have ambitious goals for the future. A big dream of the programs is to establish a permanent space for a kitchen in which cooking education programs can be consistently hosted. Health & Wellness would also be eager to get other groups involved in this potential cooking space and allow organizations to also host classes and workshops.

(Daily Nexus / Nina Timofeyeva) Another goal for the Health & Wellness nutrition programs is to provide more encouraging conversation around cultural foods. Whether it's ingredient accessibility, lack of representation of cultural foods in the dining halls or encouraging students to try new recipes and dishes, Health & Wellness hopes to promote more culturally rich and diverse meals at UCSB. By gathering information on what cultural foods students would like to see, Health & Wellness is able to host educational workshops and offer resources for where to find multicultural pantry staples. *See the Exploring the Asian Landscape article* The rice and beans program is set to expand over spring quarter to offer more pre-packaged bowls at longer working hours.

The carnival featured the recognizable Ferris wheel set up in the middle of Pardall St., a variety of tabling organizations, churros, carnival games, a mechanical bull, and much more.† As carnival attendees gathered on the somewhat narrow I.V. street, smiles and laughs could be seen all around. Unique games such as a ring toss activity in which players wore vision-distorting goggles and had soap bubbles blown at them, not only entertained, but taught players about the effects of alcohol on perception. Clubs and organizations handed out stickers, T-shirts, snacks, and other goodies to those who came to learn about their causes. Upbeat melodies further fostered an atmosphere of enjoyment and happiness and people could be seen dancing in various corners with their friends.† Local businesses such as Cozy and Sweet Jane also benefited from this increased traffic past their storefronts, attracting customers in mass amounts. Blenders cups were visible in all directions, signifying the increasing popularity of their smoothies on warmer days.† Student volunteers, musicians, artists, and vendors gathered to make this carnival a success by contributing their efforts in its organization and presence. This exciting event showcased the diversity and engagement of the UCSB and I.V. communities, speaking to the caring environment community members strive to create all around.†  Œî  Œî US Dollar 2,000 in a Single Online Day Due to its position, the United States offers a plethora of opportunities for those seeking employment.
