sports,UCSB End Non-Conf. Portion of Season in Winning Fashion,1-Jan-18,12:37 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-01/80339/,"After breaking through the defense, Jalen Canty prepares to shoot. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Playing in its final non-conference game before the opening of Big West play, the UCSB men's basketball team didn't waste any time against Pacific Union in the Thunderdome on Saturday night. The Gauchos jumped out to a big early lead and held strong through all 40 minutes of action, ultimately coasting to an 81-49 blowout win over the Pioneers. Saturday's victory capped a successful non-conference schedule for UCSB. Only a year removed from going 2-10 in non-conference play, the Gauchos are 11-3 so far this year. Those three losses came at the hands of USC, No. 11 Texas A&M and Pitt, all Power Five teams. UCSB more than held its own in all three of those losses, falling by an average margin of about 13 points. When they weren't taking on some of the best teams in the country, the Gauchos took care of business with their 11 wins in their best non-conference performance in at least a decade, and enter Big West play on a three-game win streak. The third win in that streak came on Saturday night against Pacific Union, an NAIA school with a 2-7 record this season. It was clear immediately that the Pioneers didn't stand much of a chance of pulling off the upset. The Gauchos held a 21-10 lead just ten minutes into the game, and managed to open up that advantage to 36-18 by halftime. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger led the Gaucho offense with 11 points in those first twenty minutes despite an uncharacteristically poor shooting performance, going 5-12 from the field and 1-5 from three in the first half. UCSB didn't shoot particularly well from the field Saturday night, but that didn't seem to matter much. The Gauchos shot 44 percent from the field, but were a shaky 26.1 percent from beyond the three-point line. Much of UCSB's first half dominance can be attributed to its mastery of the boards. The Gauchos pulled down 36 first half rebounds to Pacific Union's 15, with graduate transfer Leland King II leading the way with 11 rebounds in the first half for UCSB. Senior forward Jalen Canty and sophomore guard Christian Terrell also got in on the rebound party, as both players grabbed seven boards in the first 20 minutes. Prior to Saturday's game, Terrell's season high for rebounds was seven, set back on Dec. 5 against Nebraska-Omaha. None of the Gauchos' first-half starters played more than five minutes in the second half, but that doesn't mean the hosts took their feet off the gas pedal. UCSB scored 45 points in the second half alone, and saw every player that entered the game score. J.D. Slajchert was one of those players, and the junior forward made the most of his season-high 10 minutes of play. Slajchert scored a season-best six points on 2-for-5 shooting, and knocked down one free throw. Overall, the Gauchos had nine players finish with at least five points, a balanced offensive attack that was key to their second-half scoring efforts. Heidegger's 16 points led the way, but King II and Canty weren't far behind with 10 each, as both players posted a double-double on the night as well. Jayson Marquez was Pacific Union's only player in double-digit points Saturday night, although Rae Hubbard finished one point shy with nine points. Forward Noel Briones led all Pioneers with nine rebounds, third-best across both teams, but a 1-7 night from the field limited him to just two points. UCSB will attempt to stretch its three-game win streak out a bit more as it enters Big West play on Thursday, Jan. 4 at Cal Poly. The Mustangs are 5-9 on the season, but have a strong 85-82 loss to Cal on their resume. The Gauchos take Cal Poly on Thursday night at 7:00 pm.

sports,Gauchos to Host Long Beach and Cal Poly to Open Big West Play,2-Jan-18,12:47 AM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-02/gauchos-to-host-long-beach-and-cal-poly-to-open-big-west-play/,"Sarah Porter dribbles the ball, looking for a pass. Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus With non-conference play wrapped up, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to carry its momentum into Big West play. The Gauchos closed out 2017 with a bang, as they crushed New Mexico State by 30 points, their largest margin of victory this season. In spite of recent struggles highlighted by nine straight losses, UCSB has now won two games in a row to give them an overall record of 3-9. The team's record places the Gauchos in seventh place of the Big West Conference standings prior to the start of conference competition. Although Santa Barbara's slow start hasn't been the type of season the team wished for, it will look to continue to improve when it host Long Beach State this week. Thursday's game against the 49ers seems like it will be a favorable matchup for UCSB, as Long Beach is in the midst of a five-game slide and sit at 2-12 overall this season. Regardless of their sub-par record, the 49ers are being led by promising freshman Shanaijah Davison. The 5'8 guard is averaging a team-high 11.9 points per game, and put up 29 points versus USC earlier this season. With seven freshmen on the Long Beach roster, another promising player has been 6'5 center Emma Merriweather. Only a freshman, Merriweather has recorded an impressive 22 total blocks in addition to averaging 9.2 points and 5.7 boards per contest. Long Beach will be eager to snap their losing streak when it faces UCSB, but the Gauchos have some talent on their roster as well. As a redshirt senior, forward Drew Edelman hasn't slowed down, leading the Gauchos through their rough patch with 15.2 points and just over 8 rebounds per game. Edelman has performed closer to her ability lately, posting a 25 and 10 double-double in Santa Barbara's win over San Diego State while she continues to be a vocal leader for her team on both ends of the court. UCSB has some promising freshmen of its own, with first-year guard Sarah Bates coming up big in recent contests. Bates has scored in double figures in her last two games and is playing big minutes as a freshman, averaging a little over 25 minutes per game. Thursday's contest between the 49ers and Gauchos will interestingly enough be a repeat of last year's Big West Tournament championship game. Long Beach squeaked out the win over UCSB in a nail-biter, so the Gauchos are likely eager to redeem themselves on top of extending their winning streak. The action will tip off at the Thunderdome on Thursday, Jan. 4 at 7 p.m. as UCSB looks to earn just its second home victory this season. Win or lose against the 49ers on Thursday, Santa Barbara will have a short break before hosting rival Cal Poly at the Thunderdome for an afternoon contest on Saturday. The Mustangs have had their respective ups and downs this season, sitting at the .500 mark with a 6-6 record. Cal Poly will visit UC Riverside Thursday before heading to the Thunderdome. The Mustangs have been led by the senior duo of sisters Dynn and Lynn Leaupepe. The Leaupepe duo features Dynn scoring 15.7 ppg and Lynn averaging a close 14.1 ppg. UCSB was torched by Dynn in last year's January game, as she scored a season-high 29 points in the Mustang victory so the Santa Barbara coaching staff will undoubtedly work towards containing her on the offensive end. The Blue-Green rivalry game will tip off at 2 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 6 as the Gauchos and Mustangs will both be looking for bragging rights in addition to improving their records.

sports,Gauchos Outlast 49ers in Conference Opener,5-Jan-18,7:30 PM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-05/gauchos-outlast-49ers-in-conference-opener/,"Sarah Porter brings the ball up the court. Despite another slow start offensively, the UCSB women's basketball team came alive in the third quarter, outscoring Long Beach State 17-5 to claim the 51-44 victory. The Gauchos have now won their last three games and with Thursday night's win over the 49ers Santa Barbara is 1-0 in conference play, improving their overall record to 4-9. While UCSB is rolling compared to the start of the season, the 49ers are pushed to a dismal 2-13 overall as they open league play with their sixth straight loss. A rematch of last year's Big West Championship, in which Long Beach got the best of the Gauchos, Thursday night's game opened with an energy in the Thunderdome signaling the return of conference-play atmosphere. The 49ers pressured Santa Barbara using a 3-2 zone along with a full-court press disrupting the Gauchos' offense early. Shots weren't falling easily for either team and the Gauchos had a difficult time keeping possession, turning the ball over 7 times in the first quarter alone. For nearly the first seven minutes of play, UCSB had only 3 points off a Drew Edelman free throw and a jumper by Danae Miller. The defensive battle had the score locked at 5-3 Long Beach before Makala Roper knocked down a three for the Gauchos with 3:38 remaining. A few back and forth buckets closed out the quarter 12-12. Head coach Bonnie Henrickson said following the game, ""úSometimes you've got to be able to handle that this might one of those nights, it might be in the forties and fifties and you've got to be comfortable doing that,""ù said Henrickson, ""úYou've got to be able to play through that and still win in the fifties.""ù Makala Roper got things going for Santa Barbara in the second quarter, draining her second three ball of the night to put the Gauchos ahead 15-12. Long Beach responded by going on an 8-0 run, forcing head coach Bonnie Henrickson to call a quick timeout with roughly 6:04 remaining. Out of the 30-second timeout, the Gauchos went inside to find Edelman in back to back possessions for two easy buckets. Edelman asserted herself in the paint throughout the game, getting good position as well as good looks at the basket, but had a hard time getting shots to fall. The redshirt senior did have a career night rebounding the ball, grabbing 23 boards while just missing a double-double with 9 points. Roper kept heating up, making another shot from beyond the arc to put the Gauchos down a single point heading into halftime 22-23. The first half of play featured both squads struggling to find the net, as UCSB and Long Beach each shot close to 31 percent overall and 27 percent from three-point territory. Edelman had 13 of her final 23 rebounds at half, but UCSB also committed 13 turnovers in the half. In spite of their rough start shooting, the Gauchos came out after halftime with a re-focused energy on both ends of the court. Santa Barbara opened the third on a 9-0 run, holding the 49ers scoreless for almost 5 minutes. UCSB went on to score 17 total points in the quarter, with Sarah Bates, Sarah Porter and again Roper chipping in a three-pointer each. Roper's three came at the buzzer to lift the Gauchos to a 39-28 advantage after three quarters of play. The 49ers had a rough quarter to say the least, going 1-10 from the field, 0-4 from three, and 3-10 from the charity stripe. Makala Roper made another three to kick off the fourth quarter for her game and season-high 15 points, all from beyond the arc. Long Beach guard Shanijah Davison got to the line on the following possession, converting 1 of 2 free throws. The freshman Davison had a difficult night, shooting only 1-10 from the field and finishing the game with 4 points. Heading into the game, Davison was the 49ers' leading scorer with 11.9 points per game. 49er Cecily Wilson knocked down 1 of 2 shots from the line shortly after Davison, but the Gauchos answered with an Akilah Jennings three to take their largest lead of the night, up 15, with 8:50 remaining. Down 45-30 with just 8:50 left, 49ers refused to back off as Long Beach upped their defensive pressure to disrupt the Gauchos. After Akilah jennings made a nice move to the basket for a bucket at the 6:51 mark, the Gauchos failed to make another shot aside from free throws. Long Beach used their defensive stops to generate offense, going on a 10-0 run over the next 6 minutes to cut Santa Barbara's lead to 3. Cecily Wilson had 7 of her team-high 9 points in the fourth to go with her team-high 10 rebounds. Down 47-44 with 53 seconds left, Long Beach mistakenly fouled Sarah Bates, sending her to the line where she knocked down the two free throws. Sloppy play and a variety of weird calls by the referees found the 49ers forced to send Bates to the line again with only 3 seconds to go. Bates came up clutch at the line again, hitting both shots to give the Gauchos the 51-44 victory. After the game, the freshman guard Bates discussed her team's improved play in the third quarter. ""úI think we got a little more used to the pressure, but we were still struggling with it. It was our offense more than their defense, even though they're a good defensive team,""ù said Bates. Following the Gauchos' 1-9 start in the regular season, the Gauchos finally have momentum and a growing identity when they play. ""úI mean it's a lot better than being 1-9,""ù said Drew Edelman, ""úWe have a little bit more confidence going in. Especially now that it's conference play, we said, ""òOk whatever our record was preseason ultimately it doesn't matter, it's all about conference.'""ù With a big game against rival Cal Poly on Saturday, Santa Barbara is hoping to carry its energy further into conference play. ""úIt was a process, we've learned from it. So now, new season, we're 1 and 0,""ù continued Edelman. Head coach Bonnie Henrickson is looking to continue her team's growth this season, as beating the now 2-13 49ers is not as daunting as a task as beating Cal Poly. ""úSo, we're fortunate to find a way to win, but that locker room is mature enough to know we weren't very good and we've got to be better on Saturday, and we'll get a chance to be better on† Saturday,""ù said Henrickson, ""úAnd we're mature enough to recognize that. UCSB takes on Cal Poly for the Blue-Green rivalry game Saturday afternoon, with tip-off scheduled for 2:00pm.

sports,Gauchos Hang on to Win Blue-Green Rivalry,7-Jan-18,7:39 PM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-07/gauchos-hang-on-to-win-blue-green-rivalry/,"Makala Roper pushes past UC Riverside's defense, attempting to score a point for the Gauchos. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's team survived a late Cal Poly comeback effort on Saturday to open the first week of Big West play 2-0. Starting the fourth quarter the Gauchos were ahead of the Mustangs by 19 points, but a Mustang effort to make the game interesting prompted a 14-2 run during a stretch in the final quarter. Without a field goal for over four minutes, the Gauchos were lucky enough to make enough free throws in the end, coming out on top 73-68. Although conference season is far from over, the Gauchos now sit at second in the Big West behind fellow 2-0 UC Davis. After starting the season 1-9, Santa Barbara, now 5-9,† has won its last four games, effectively turning the season around for conference play. Head coach Bonnie Henrickson knows there's still room for improvement, ""úWe aren't where we were, we aren't where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction.""ù With Cal Poly's comeback effort falling short, the Mustangs settle back in to .500, 1-1 in the Big West and 7-7 overall. Cal Poly's senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who came into the game off a 40-point performance in an overtime win over UC Riverside, had a game-high 30 points on 27 shots at the Thunderdome. In an off night shooting for Leaupepe and her teammates, Cal Poly finished the game 26 for 70 from the field. The first quarter of play found both teams locked at 0-0 until the 6:42 mark, when Makala Roper drove the lane and finished, giving the Gauchos the 2-0 lead. Roper, a senior, had 7 of her 15 points in the first quarter, and finished the game with a career high 9 assists. Bringing defensive energy early, Santa Barbara held the Mustangs to just 8 points off 18 percent shooting in the quarter, leading 11-8 heading into the second. ""úI know everything can get flustered,""ù said Roper post-game, ""úand I'm the point guard so I need to make sure everyone's calm. I have to make sure to have a level head so everything is okay.""ù Despite Cal Poly's terrible shooting effort in the first, the Mustangs continued to put pressure on Santa Barbara in a variety of press and trap defenses. Obviously feeling this pressure, the Gauchos turned the ball over 8 times in the first quarter alone and went on to turn it over 7 more times in the second. In the high-octane second quarter, Santa Barbara outscored Cal Poly 28-16 to take a 39-24 going into halftime. The Gauchos had no problem finding the net, shooting over 60 percent overall and from downtown. Dynn Leaupepe put her team on her back in the quarter, scoring 13 of her team's 16 points, but it wasn't enough to counter the Gauchos' weapon off the bench: Tal Sahar. Sahar, who didn't log a single minute in the team's victory over Long Beach on Thursday, came alive in the second to score all of her 17 points in the quarter. The redshirt sophomore said after the game, ""úFrom the first shot I took, I was like, okay, this is going to be a good game.""ù Sahar's energy was part of an 11-2 UCSB run to open the quarter, forcing a Mustang timeout. Senior Chaya Durr spoke following the game, addressing Sahar's contribution. ""úTal came in with great minutes off the bench and got us hyped up as well,""ù Durr said, ""úShe was knocking down shots and we were just feeding off of it. It was just working.""ù The Gauchos had another hot quarter in the third, shooting 50 percent from three. While Dynn Leaupepe herself scored another 7 in the quarter, Sarah Bates and Chaya Durr each had 8 for UCSB and Roper added 6 as the Gauchos outscored the Mustangs 24-20. Durr finished the game with 10 points and 8 boards, hitting a three at the buzzer to put her team up 63-44 heading into the final quarter. Up by 19 with just 10 minutes left to play, the Gauchos seemed in control. After the Mustangs hit a pair of threes, Drew Edelman made a layup with 6:50 left to give Santa Barbara a comfortable 17-point lead. With 11 points and a game-high 10 boards, Edelman finished with a double-double on an efficient 5 of 7 shooting. The Mustangs refused to go away, though, organizing a trapping press defense that flustered the Gauchos. Facing the pressure, Santa Barbara lost possession a total 10 times in the fourth to record a season-high 33 turnovers on the night. The Mustangs took advantage of Santa Barbara's mistakes, scoring 39 points off turnovers over the course of the game, but it wasn't until the final quarter that Cal Poly closed the gap. An 11-0 Poly run forced a UCSB timeout with just 2:55 remaining, the Gauchos now only ahead 67-61. Their 19-point lead diminished to just 6, the Gauchos regrouped during the timeout to extend their lead to 8 off a Roper jumpshot. In desperation mode, the Mustangs got a quick three-ball and a layup to fall, moving within three of the Gauchos, 66-69 with just under 2 minutes to go. With 55 seconds left, Sarah Bates got to the rim with a nice move for an and-one. The freshman guard, who finished with 17, completed the three-point play to give her team the 72-66 point lead. With time running out, Cal Poly was forced to fire up some quick shots, but it was too little, too late. The Gauchos survived the comeback effort, holding on to win 73-68. With 33 turnovers, the Gauchos' win over Cal Poly has some areas of concern for head coach Bonnie Henrickson, but also some positives. ""úClearly, we've got to be better with more poise and composure,""ù said Henrickson, ""úI thought Chaya [Durr] defensively was really good on Dynn [Leaupepe], I thought our scouting report defense was really good.""ù The Gauchos now have two road games ahead of them, versus CSU Northridge and UC Irvine this coming week. On a winning streak and still making improvements, 2-0 Santa Barbara is certainly eager to continue Big West play.

sports,UCSB Tallies First Big West Win,8-Jan-18,7:48 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-08/ucsb-tallies-first-big-west-win/,"After breaking through the defense, Jalen Canty prepares to shoot. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus On Thursday night, the UCSB men's basketball team blew a 20-point-plus lead to Cal Poly. On Saturday night against UC Riverside, the Gauchos almost did it again. Just two nights removed from a heartbreaking 80-79 loss to the Mustangs, the Gauchos picked up their first Big West win of the season against the Highlanders by a score of 65-57, pushing UCSB to 12-4 overall and 1-1 in league play. Eight minutes into their game against Cal Poly on Thursday, it seemed as though the Gauchos were destined to pick up their first league win in their first try. The Mustangs had no answer for UCSB, which jumped out to a 23-2 lead with 12:54 remaining in the first half. The early Gaucho offensive explosion was driven by a balanced offensive attack. Six different players scored in that 23-2 run, and four players ended the first half with at least five points. The last ten minutes of the first half were markedly different from the first. Cal Poly ran off a 20-5 run at the end of the half to cut the Gaucho lead to 40-36 at halftime, as the hosts scored only eight points in the last eight minutes. While the first half was defined by two opposing runs, the second half was back-and-forth on a more microscopic level. With 13 lead changes in the second half alone, neither team was willing to let the other rest. Senior forward Jalen Canty had the hot hand in the second half, shooting 8-10 from the field for 17 points, one for each minute he played in the period. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger, normally the Gauchos' most dependable and prolific scorer, was comparatively cold in going 2-10 for nine points in the last 20 minutes. For all his second half struggles, however, Heidegger made the shot his team needed him to. After Donovan Fields layup brought the Mustangs into a 77-77 tie, Heidegger buried a tough midrange jumper to give UCSB a 79-77 lead with exactly one second remaining in regulation. Up two with just one clock tick to go, all the Gauchos had to do in order to secure their fourth win in a row and first in Big West play was to contest any last-second shot without fouling. They were unsuccessful in doing so. Fields, inbounding the ball, ran the baseline and hit Luke Meikle with a long pass over halfcourt. Meikle used his time wisely, getting Canty in the air with a pumpfake and drawing a three-shot foul with a desperation heave. Three clutch free throws and one missed full court shot later, and the Mustangs had completed their comeback in dramatic fashion with a 80-79 victory. Canty's unfortunate foul didn't diminish his standout performance on Thursday night. The forward led UCSB with 21 points and six blocks, and added 10 rebounds for his second double-double in a row. Leland King II was the Gauchos' leading rebounder with 15 boards, his best rebounding performance of the season. King also had 12 points, giving him his third double-double in a row. Coming off such a brutal loss as the one they suffered on Thursday night, the Gauchos needed a strong bounce back showing on Saturday against the Highlanders. They got exactly that, thanks largely to a dominant game from King. The graduate transfer had 17 points in the first half alone on Saturday in the Thunderdome, and finished with 22 on the night. His 13 rebounds gave King his fourth double-double in a row, and helped the Gauchos overcome a quiet 2-point night from Jalen Canty. Neither team shot the ball particularly well from the field, as UCSB shot 39 percent while UCR shot 38 percent, but the Gauchos made up for it with 11 made threes on 28 attempts. Five of those threes came off the fingertips of Heidegger, who was second on the team with 19 points. Despite leading by 24 points with just 16 minutes to play, the Gauchos came close to blowing yet another massive lead. Riverside's DJ Sylvester sank a layup with 5:06 remaining to make the score 56-51 but a couple of Heidegger three pointers boosted the lead back into more comfortable territory for UCSB. Highlander forward Alex Larsson was his team's most efficient contributor with 10 points on 5-10 shooting, and his 11 rebounds gave the 6-10 senior a double-double of his own. Sylvester, at 4-13 from the field, was far less efficient, but still managed to lead Riverside with 13 points. After playing two games in three days, the Gauchos now get a whole week off in order to prepare for a road game in Hawaii on Saturday, when they'll take on the Rainbow Warriors. Hawaii's record of 10-5, 1-1 looks remarkably similar to UCSB's, setting Saturday's matchup up as an intriguing barometer for both teams. UCSB takes on Hawaii on Saturday in Honolulu at 10:00 p.m.

sports,2018 CFP Championship Award Winners,11-Jan-18,2:19 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-11/2018-cfp-championship-award-winners/,"It was a nail biter of a game last Monday, as the Alabama Crimson Tide clawed their way back from a 2nd half 13-0 deficit versus the Georgia Bulldogs. Alabama went on to win the College Football Playoff National Championship 26-23, in overtime, as they once again further their platform as the most dominant program in the modern day college football era. † 1) The 33rd NFL Team Award: Alabama Crimson Tide Boasting an immense fan base, professional grade facilities, and continuously fielding a winning roster year in and year out, Alabama is sometimes referred to as the 33rd NFL team. Sure, the name alone can attract practically every single high school talent to their stadium. However, Alabama's history as one of the most successful in the business can be directly compared to the NFL's professional level. More specifically speaking, in just last year alone Alabama had the 2nd most players get selected to play with the big boys during the 2017 NFL Draft. With a total of 11 players going pro, and the lowest being an early 4th round draft pick, it's easy to see why the Crimson Tide are as esteemed as they are. Jokes aside, as much as we want to see this very unlikely game to take place, there's no way they'd win against the Cleveland Browns, c'mon. 2) The It's A Georgia Thing Award: Georgia Bulldogs Whether it's blowing the lead in college football's most important game of the year in front of national television or blowing an even bigger lead during Super Bowl LI, one thing is for sure: you're probably a Georgia team. Yes, it hasn't been a good year for football in the state of Georgia in general, and of course we've heard and seen all the 28-3 memes we can possibly bear, but on the bright side the underdog Bulldogs will have a great quarterback in true freshman Jake Fromm for at least another year. 3) The Coolest Quarterback in Town: Jake Fromm Jake Fromm finished his first year in the college spotlight with a total 2615 yards, 24 touchdowns, and only 7 interceptions; resulting in a whopping 160.1 quarterback rating. Fromm is quite the young talent and his journey towards the national championship can only help towards his campaign in next year's Heisman Trophy voting. And if you need any more evidence of how awesome Fromm is, here's a GIF of him spinning the ball as he drops back in the pocket. Jake Fromm spinning the ball in his hands as he drops back on third down üëÄüèà pic.twitter.com/Y6tch1FjDw ""î Sports Illustrated (@SInow) January 9, 2018 
 4) The Super Sub Award: Tua Tagovailoa Before the game Tua probably visualized such a scenario to occur, but honestly he probably didn't expect it to become a reality. Alabama's starting quarterback, Jalen Hurts, had played phenomenal all season long for the Crimson Tide. However, once head coach Nick Saban saw Alabama's chances at another national championship slipping away, he made the controversial decision to bench his star for a back up. Previous to this Tua hardly played any meaningful minutes, yet he still led his team to victory and posted 166 yards for 3 touchdowns and only a single interception. Talk about coming in clutch as the super sub. 5) The College GOAT? Award: Nick Saban With perhaps only former Alabama head coach Bear Bryant in his way, Nick Saban definitely makes a case for potentially being the best college football head coach of all time. With an all time record of 218-62-1 (.778) and a 127-20 (.864) record in only his 11 seasons with Alabama, Saban has won 5 national titles and coached 2 Heisman winners alongside 46 First Team All-Americans. His overall knowledge and success with football has definitely cemented his name into the historic conversation, and unless an NFL team takes him away, then Alabama's victories will only continue to pile up. 6) The Maybe We Should Pay College Athletes Award: Nick Saban's Salary $11.125 million to Saban alone, around $18 million total if you're counting the rest of Alabama's coaching staff; in this day and age where the NCAA keep getting rich while these and other student athletes sometimes question where their next meal may come from""¶you do the math. 7) Honorable Mention: Kendrick Lamar's Halftime Performance To sum it up: it was freaking awesome. I'm also biased and a huge Kendrick Lamar fan but that's beside the point. We also got to see the new Black Panther trailer and talk about how Alabama is getting destroyed for once; overall, a night to remember in both college sports and entertainment altogether.

sports,UCSB Earns Close Road Win to Remain Unbeaten in League Play,11-Jan-18,2:41 PM,['Kendra Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-11/ucsb-earns-close-road-win-to-remain-unbeaten-in-league-play/,"
On the road against the Matadors, Santa Barbara came out on top of what was a thrilling matchup that came up to the last few minutes of play.†
The outcome of this game puts Cal State Northridge at 8-8, and 1-1 in the Big West, while UCSB is 6-9, and sitting atop the Big West at a commanding 3-0.
The game was neck and neck the entire time, both teams going blow for blow until the fourth quarter, where the Gauchos edged out with a one-point advantage over their opponents.
After the half, the game was a stalemate, with both teams sitting at 34 points.
Neither team was able to hold on to a lead bigger than four points, until the home team managed to gain a six-point advantage over Santa Barbara halfway through the third period. Directly after, the Gauchos struck back by going on a powerful 9-0 run to gain a three-point lead.†
The score was tied once again at the end of the third quarter, all knotted up at 56.
The visitors opened up the forth on an 8-0 run, which included three pointers being scored by both freshman guard Sarah Bates and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar, with Bates again contributing 2 more points to cap off the run.
CSUN wouldn't lie down, though, as they kept the game close. Calling a timeout with 32 ticks on the clock left to play, Cal State Northridge went to their junior center Channon Fluker, who intensified the closeness of the game by scoring a clutch layup to create a 73-70 score at 20 seconds, UCSB still holding the lead.†
After the score, sophomore guard Hayley Tanabe forced a turnover for the Gauchos and came up with the pivotal steal in crunch time and called a timeout immediately after the grab.
Down three points and going for the tie, the Matadors put the game in the hands of their junior guard Claudia Ramos, who's three-point attempt ended up missing the mark.
After the three-pointer from Ramos fell short, Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman snagged the rebound. Upon grabbing the board, Edelman was fouled by Fluker.†
While at the charity stripe, Edelman missed her initial free throw attempt, but drained the second free throw with just four seconds left to play in regulation.
The home team, with possession and no timeouts left, quickly inbounded the ball and gave it to Ramos, who splashed in a three-pointer to beat the final buzzer.
Though exciting, the basket by Ramos was futile, as the final score was officially 74-73 at the end of regulation ""ì with Santa Barbara taking the win.†
While UCSB had a slightly better field goal percentage (40.0%) than the Matadors (39.4%), the home team also won some standout stats the sheet. The most notable discrepancy between the Gauchos and their opponents was the domination of the points in the paint by the home team.
CSUN scored a tremendous 48 points in the paint, compared to the less than half 22 points Santa Barbara had scored in the paint.
In the game, Bates exploded for a team-leading 23 points for UCSB, going 6-11 from the field and shooting 5-7 from beyond the arc. Bates also led her team in assists, dishing out 5 dimes during regulation.
Senior small forward Chaya Durr grabbed 9 boards, tying Matador junior center Channon Fluker for the game high in rebounds.
For CSUN, senior forward Tessa Boagni scored a game-high 25 points, and her teammate Tanabe dispensed a game-high seven assists.
Sitting at 3-0 in the conference, Santa Barbara looks to hold onto their streak in the Big West this weekend as they face UC Irvine on the road at Bren Events Center on Saturday January 13 at 7:00pm.

sports,Gauchos Suffer First Conf. Loss at UC Irvine,14-Jan-18,2:34 PM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-14/gauchos-suffer-first-conf-loss-at-uc-irvine/,"After opening conference play 3-0, the Gauchos lost a close game to UC Irvine on Saturday night, 77-74. Santa Barbara's four-game win streak was effectively snapped by the Anteaters as Irvine outscored the Gauchos by 9 points in the second half to take the victory. UCSB now sits at 6-10 overall and second in Big West standings at 3-1.  UC Davis, the only Big West team undefeated in conference play, will visit the Thunderdome this Thursday in a meeting of the early Big West frontrunners. Despite losing their first conference game this year to UC Davis, the Anteaters have won two straight to stand at third place in the Big West and 10-7 overall.† Saturday's contest saw the return of guard Drea Toler, who was not with the team during the extent of fall quarter.  Toler, a redshirt senior, averaged roughly 10 points per game last year to go along with 4.6 assists. Against Irvine, Toler did a bit of everything for the Gauchos, recording 9 points, 5 assists, and 5 boards. The first quarter of play found Santa Barbara and Irvine both struggling to efficiently find the net, shooting a combined 11 for 34 from the field. While the Gauchos also went 1-6 from beyond the arc in the first, Drew Edelman went to work in the paint, scoring 9 of her team-high 18 points in the decently-even quarter. Morgan Green got to the line with 11 seconds left to knock down two free throws to put Irvine behind 17-18 heading into the second.† In the second, Drew Toler scored 7 of her 9 points as Santa Barbara held the Anteaters to just 14 points. The Gauchos went on a scoring drought that last over three minutes, but threes by Tal Sahar and Toler towards the end of the first half extended their lead to 37-31. †In the third, it was Irvine making the push, as the Anteaters held Santa Barbara to 14 points and closed out the quarter on an 8-0 run thanks to Morgan Green and Lauren Saiki.  Green and Saiki each scored 8 points in the third. Green finished the night with a game-high 25 points and 6 rebounds. The run by the Anteaters gave Irvine a 53-51 lead going into the final 10 minutes of play. †In a high-scoring fourth quarter, Irvine outscored the Gauchos 24-23 to complete the comeback effort. Although UCSB closed out the game with their last 12 points coming from three pointers, the Anteaters managed to make all 8 of their free throws in the fourth to keep in front of Santa Barbara.  Yazzy Sa'Dullah knocked down two from the line with 18 seconds left to put the Anteaters up 6. Sarah Porter managed to hit a three with 2 seconds remaining as part of her 8-point quarter, but it was too late for the Gauchos.† Losing only by 3 points, Santa Barbara has to be disappointed, but the continual growth of the Gauchos this season is perhaps a silver lining head coach Bonnie Henrickson can find in this game.  The Gauchos matched the Anteaters in many aspects and even held the advantage in the paint as well as in terms of bench production. UCSB outscored Irvine 28-22 down low and got 26 points from its bench, but the difference in the game seemed to be free-throws.  While the Anteaters managed to go 18 for 23 from the charity stripe, the Gauchos only made 8 of their 15 free throws. Santa Barbara with its 23 personal fouls committed marks a season-high for the Gauchos.† Despite giving Irvine 18 points from free-throws, UCSB's offense has now scored 70 points or higher in 5 of its last 6 games.  Drew Edelman with another double-double is almost averaging one with 14 ppg and 9.4 rebounds per game. As Santa Barbara's offense is rolling, the Gauchos will likely work on their defensive game-plan this week before playing Thursday in an effort to cut down on fouls.  As the Gauchos work Drea Toler back into games, Santa Barbara will aim to get back on track at home against UC Davis on Thursday, January 18. Comments are closed.

sports,2018 NFL Playoffs: Divisional Round Award Winners,16-Jan-18,2:10 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-16/2018-nfl-playoffs-divisional-round-award-winners/,"The NFL's Divisional Playoff round has now concluded, and talk about a weekend of upset performances. First on Saturday, the Eagles hosted the Falcons in a cold winter night matchup at Lincoln Financial Field.  As the No. 1 seed, they were the first team in NFL Divisional round history to also be considered the underdog; they went on to beat the Falcons 15-10. For the Steelers, top football analysts were already beginning to write headlines for a likely AFC Championship game versus the Patriots; they ended up conceding a total of 45 points to the Jaguars and exited the playoffs.  And don't even get us started on that instant classic of a game between the Vikings and Saints. Altogether, it was a breathtaking week for football. So here are some awards to help us look back on such a special round of the NFL Divisional Playoffs. 1) The One and Done Award: Nick Foles' Haters With Carson Wentz out for the season after injuring his ACL in a Week 14 matchup versus the Rams, many people projected the Eagles to lose their first playoff game. Keep in mind that the Eagles also boasted a first round bye week since they finished the regular season as the No. 1 seed. Nevertheless, score predictions were very much in favor of the Falcons early on.  Enter Nick Foles, the main reason why postseason expectations weren't high for Philadelphia. Being only a stand in replacement for the franchise's future of Wentz, Foles was hired in hopes of keeping the hype rolling, and that he did. The Eagles went on to win their Divisional playoff match against the Falcons in nail biting fashion, and the rest was history. To summarize, enjoy Chris Long wearing an underdog mask in this article's thumbnail. 2) The It's STILL A Georgia Thing Award: Atlanta Falcons A no longer existent run-game, safety Keanu Neal turning bouncing an almost certain interception off his knee back into the receivers hands for a 20 yard gain to setup a before the half field goal, and a Julio Jones slip up leading to a missed clutch catch opportunity to win the game; these were just a few of the many other things that went wrong for the Falcons during their game versus the Eagles.  This game was just riddled with mistakes from both sides, yet Falcons just couldn't seem to capitalize whenever they were gifted the chance to. The Falcons were also recently lauded as a dominant team that might just make it all the way to the Super Bowl again. Sadly, per Georgia football tradition, they blew it. This year is just not your year Falcons and Bulldogs fans, good news is a lot of good karma should now be stacked and headed your way very soon""¶hopefully. 3) The Better Luck Next Year Award: Mike Mularkey This isn't a full on jab at the Tennessee Titans, considering they upset the Kansas City Chiefs by coming back from a 21-3 deficit. Rather, this one goes out to head coach Mike Mularkey who got the job done well enough in order to keep said job.  Rumors were stirring before the Chiefs game that the Titans would be observing other possible head coach candidates in case things didn't pan out in the playoffs.  After such a stellar performance, Mularkey managed to quiet his critics and retain his leadership position heading into next season. Regardless, their divisional playoff performance was a pretty abysmal 14-35 loss in Foxborough against the Patriots. Still, there's plenty to look forward to next year with Mariota's progression, a defense that's still forming its identity, and a familiar coaching staff that helped a losing franchise turn it around all the way to the playoffs. Courtesy of the The Portland Press Herald 4) The 40 is the New TB12 Award: Tom Brady Play action dots for first down, 60 yard deep throws, and that pass to Amendola from the right hash to the left while falling down, just wow. Tom Brady looked in fine form against the Titans and his age has appeared to be a non factor for yet another postseason.  Rob Gronkowski, who missed last year's entire playoffs due to injury, also made his return to postseason football as he helped Brady reach his mark of 337 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Titans. Last year it was the Julian Edelman show, but this year the elite duo of Brady and Gronkowski will continue to prove to be one of the best as well as essential to the Patriots' repeat Super Bowl aspirations. † † † 5) The Fourth Season's A Charm Award: Blake Bortles What can be said? Blake Bortles went out there Sunday morning and got the job done almost flawlessly. Add in a remarkable rookie postseason performance and you get yourself a Divisional playoff win on the road against the Steelers.  Easier said than done, but this one was a high scoring 45-42 game for the fans ""úBy Jove, I think he's got it! It's been 4 seasons putting up with Bortles but I think he's got it,""ù ""ì most likely yelled by a Jaguars fan somewhere in Jacksonville. 6) The Steelers Can Still Play the Patriots Award: Madden NFL 18 This was mostly a reference to the Jaguar's Twitter account, which was honestly on fire all day following their divisional playoff win. Truth be told, most people were already envisioning an AFC Championship matchup between Pittsburgh and New England; until the Jaguars had something to say about it.  Leaving no analyst's cold take unpunished, the Jaguars even responded to Mike Mitchell's hubristic response: ""úwe can play [the Patriots] in hell, we can play them in Haiti, we can play them in New England and we're gonna win""ù, by letting him know that their premature exit has granted him an offseason full of football video gaming distraction. † 7) The Game of the Season Award: Minnesota Vikings vs. New Orleans Saints The gritty Minnesota defense and the high octane New Orleans offense, this NFC Divisional matchup was definitely the game of the season so far. Following a missed field goal at the half, the Saints were set up with a 17-0 deficit that had fellow internet pundits exclaiming that it was all over since the opponent boasted the best defense in the entire National Football League. Little did they know, yet they still chose to ignore, was that Drew Brees was at the helm of the New Orleans comeback. courtesy of Sports Illustrated And comeback they did as by the final two minutes of the 4th quarter had the Saints up 21-20 over the Vikings; then what followed was what truly turned this game into a classic. The 4th quarter experienced 4 different lead changes and the entire match was resolved within the last play. With time almost up, the Vikings needed only a field goal to secure their slot in the NFC Championship. The odds were heavily in favor of a Saints victory, but then the unthinkable happened. Stefon Diggs caught a 60-yard touchdown after leaving his safety coverage in the dust, and ran into the end zone as the seconds ran down. It was madness in the U.S. Bank Stadium, and this game will surely be one we'll all remember for a very long time. 8) Honorable Mention: Jeff Fisher Now I know what you're thinking: Jeff Fisher, really? Really. Sure his exit from the Rams was not pristine, but guess who he coached simultaneously and are both now in the NFC Championship game: Case Keenum and Nick Foles. Oh, and Jared Goff reached the Wild Card round too. Many not so great things have been said about Fisher over the years, but one thing is for certain; he truly has an adept eye for hidden quarterback talent. † Comments are closed.

sports,Under the Scope: 2017-18 Big West Men's Basketball Preview,18-Jan-18,5:01 AM,"['Calvin Thrift', 'Sean White', 'Andrew Hernandez', 'Kendra Jackson', 'Richard Benites', 'Brandon Victor', 'Jorge Mercado', 'Andrew Bishop']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-mens-basketball-preview/,"Sean White / Daily Nexus UCSB Gauchos by Calvin Thrift† The new campaign has done wonders for the UCSB men's basketball team, and there is no doubt that they will continue to ride that momentum as conference play continues. Currently sitting at 13-5 overall, the Gauchos have already doubled their win count from last season, which saw them go just 6-22. Santa Barbara has struggled in the early parts of conference play, sitting in sixth place with just a 2-2 mark in Big West play thus far. In their two Big West losses this season, UCSB has lost by a combined two points with both games being away from home at Cal Poly and Hawaii. That being said, the Gauchos will hope to improve and make the tournament this year as opposed to last year, which saw them miss the Big West Tournament for the first time since 1998. The biggest reason for Santa Barbara's turnaround has been the addition of graduate transfer forward Leland King II and the emergence of sophomore guard Max Heidegger. King II has helped the Gauchos on both ends of the floor, and he is a near shoe-in to win Big West Newcomer of the Year. He currently averages a double-double with 16.7 points per game, fourth-best mark in the conference and 10.2 rebounds per contest, the best mark in the Big West. However, the most shocking transformation has been that of Heidegger, who has completely transformed his game to become one of the most dangerous scorers in the Big West. The sophomore currently leads the league in points per game with 21.6 and is lethal from beyond-the-arc, shooting 44.4 percent. The team's quick turnaround also has a lot to do with new Head Coach Joe Pasternack who, in his first season, has already broken the best start by a rookie coach in the program's history. Overall, there is no doubt that the Gauchos are the biggest surprise in the Big West this season, but the key will be if they can continue this in Big West play. UCSB will take on UCI at 9 p.m. this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome, where the Gauchos are still undefeated. Long Beach State 49ers by Sean White It has been nearly six years since the Long Beach State men's basketball program won its last Big West Tournament title. The 49ers were winners of the 2012 conference tournament ""î their last conference title ""î and nearly pulled off an upset over No. 1 seeded Hawaii in the 2016 Big West championship game before ending their season with an NIT first round loss. Since its NIT appearance, the Beach has seesawed between being in the middle of the pack to a potential top-tier team within the Big West. The NIT and near NCAA tournament appearances certainly influenced the 49ers' decision to boost last season's strength of schedule as they began their non-conference slate against elite programs such as Wichita State, North Carolina, Louisville, UCLA and Washington. Unfortunately, this got the best of them as they lost all five games straight, which then extended to nine games prior to their first win of the 2016-17 season. Now in the beginning stages of its 2017-18 Big West conference campaign, Long Beach State is currently in third place after a 84-75 loss to UC Davis on Wednesday, and are now 9-12 overall, 3-2 in conference play. Despite last season's tough schedule backfiring, LBSU remained committed to challenging itself with games against premier non-conference opponents such as Arizona, Michigan State and West Virginia. Despite losing each game, senior forward Gabe Levin has been still managing to produce on the 49ers' end. He leads LBSU in scoring and rebounds and is tied for the lead in steals with averages of 16.3 points, 7.2 rebounds per game and 22 steals. With just 8-of-30 three-pointers made on the season, it is evident that Levin is a dominant force for the 49ers in the paint and interior areas. Junior guard Bryan Alberts is the team's second leading scorer at 14 PPG. LBSU will host Cal State Fullerton on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 7:30 p.m. and will be nationally televised by FoxSportsWest. Cal Poly Mustangs by Andrew Hernandez Junior point guard Donovan Fields carried the ball up the floor with less than a minute left in a Nov. 18 game at Santa Clara University in a pivotal moment in which his team needed a bucket to break the 59-59 tie. Fields' 21 point effort was vital in keeping the Mustangs in the game all night, and it was the team looking at him again with just seconds on the clock. The junior answered the call and pulled up with 18 seconds left only to bury a jumper, giving the Mustangs the lead and the win. Much like that night against the Broncos, Fields has played a significant role for the Mustangs' offense all season. The point guard leads the team in assists with 63, and his 13.2 points per game is good for second highest on the team this season. Senior Victor Joseph's 13.8 points per game leads the team, and he is among one of the four players who have scored 100+ points so far this season, along with Fields, Jakub Niziol and Luke Meikle. Cal Poly is off to yet another tough start. The Mustangs sit at 6-11 and 1-2 in Big West play. The team lost seven players from last year's squad and despite filling a majority of those roster spots, the Mustangs still find themselves playing catch-up in this early part of the conference schedule. Cal Poly is coming off an underwhelming December, in which the team lost five of its seven games and is hoping to bounce back. Thus far, January hasn't been too friendly either. The Mustangs have lost their last two consecutive conference games to CSUF and Hawaii following their conference-opener victory over UCSB that was decided at the free-throw line after a controversial foul call. Earning some wins is the next objective for the Mustangs, who went 6-10 in conference play last season. The Cal Poly Mustangs play at UC Irvine Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m. on ESPN3. Cal State Northridge Matadors by Kendra Jackson The Cal State Northridge Matadors currently possess a 4-14 overall record and sit at 1-3 in conference play, and earned its most recent win with a 66-57 victory over UCR Wednesday night. Last season, the Matadors ended with an 11-19 overall record and stood at 7-9 within Big West conference play, which clinched the No. 6 seed for them in the Big West Tournament. Northridge is a balanced team as far as its roster, having nine underclassmen and eight upperclassmen. Their struggles have become apparent as their only wins have been sporadic and have only been achieved on their home court. In comparing the current season status of the Matadors to that of last season, the differences are evident. In the 2016-2017 season, CSUN was 7-7 at home, but managed to win some away games, with a 4-8 away record. Their biggest streak was a losing streak of six, which all came towards the winding down point of the season, with their last game being a loss versus the team that would eventually eliminate them from championship contention, CSUF. Northridge opened up their season in November with a win against Life Pacific, but shortly after endured a run of eight losses in non-conference play. The Matadors now stand as the eighth seed, sitting only in front of UC Riverside, who is 5-14 overall and 0-5 within the Big West. CSUN is due to host Cal Poly on Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m. UC Irvine Anteaters by Richard Benites Coming off of last year's impressive 12-4 Big West record that earned it the bragging rights of being the Big West's regular season conference champion, the UCI men's basketball team will look to establish consistency and make a redeeming return to the Big West Tournament Finals. However, it had a tough non-conference slate, which has contibuted to its current overall record of 7-13, while thus far the Anteaters have split their Big West conference matchups by a record of 2-2. After coming up just short in its 50-47 loss to UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Finals, UC Irvine has been in reflection mode as it prepares for perhaps another championship run. Big West Coach of the Year, Russell Turner, will once again work with his junior forward Jonathan Galloway, who placed second in the conference in rebounds per game. They will try to inspire a fresh new team that consists of almost three-fourths underclassmen. Following their most recent 71-54 victory on the road against the CSUN Matadors, the Anteaters' current .500 win percentage has them sitting exactly at mid table in the Big West Men's Basketball standings. Although they have had their fair share of close games, an indicator of UC Irvine's early struggles can be found in their scoring differentials. As of late, the Anteaters have averaged 70.3 points per game. Meanwhile, their opponents have tallied an average of 71.1 points per game. UC Irvine has also averaged a total of 15.3 turnovers each game, a staggering amount compared to its 10.8 forced turnovers average. UCSB will host the UC Irvine men's basketball team this Saturday, Jan. 20, at the Thunderdome. Hawaii Rainbow Warriors by Brandon Victor Just two years removed from upsetting Cal during the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Rainbow Warriors (12-5, 3-1) will look to improve upon last year, in which the team finished fifth in the Big West with an 8-8 conference record (14-16 overall). Despite being picked to once again finish fifth in the Big West and losing last season's leading scorer in former star guard/forward Noah Allen, the Rainbow Warriors have implemented a balanced attack on the offensive end that has enabled them to average 73 points a game. ""úOur team strength is probably our balance,""ù Head Coach Eran Ganot said. ""úWe have different guys who can step up and score for us on any given night. We play inside-out, play as a team and we share the ball really well.""ù While its 9-4 non-conf. start was encouraging, Hawaii was beating up on lesser competition. Against stronger opponents, the Rainbow Warriors have looked outmatched, losing by 13 to Nevada, 18 to Miami, 20 to Utah and 14 to Princeton. ""úRight now, we need to find consistency,""ù Ganot said.† ""úWe've shown flashes, from a game-to-game basis and within games. I'm not sure if we've put together a complete game this year. We need to find an ability to find a consistent level.""ù Another potential concern heading into conference play is Hawaii's lack of true road games. Hawaii split their first two conference games on the road, losing to Long Beach by eight before drubbing CSUN by 19. But Hawaii has always been dominant at home, and if it can even split their road games, the Rainbow Warriors are likely to finish near the top of the conference this season. Hawaii takes on UC Davis at home on Saturday, Jan. 20th at 9 p.m. UC Davis Aggies by Jorge Mercado Last season was a dream come true for the UC Davis men's basketball team. After putting up a tremendous effort in the regular season, the team finished with a 23-13 overall mark and an 11-5 conference record. They then made program history, winning their first Big West Tournament title and an NCAA playoff match before having their historical run end against top-seeded Kansas. The player behind that historical run is Chima Moneke. He was a force to be reckoned with, averaging 14.6 points per game and 9.5 rebounds. Moneke earned Big West Newcomer of the Year honors as well as an All-Big West First Team nod. Moneke was the guy everyone was going to have their eye on, and it's safe to say he has not disappointed. The senior forward has had an excellent season averaging 19.8 points and 10.1 rebounds per contest, both second-best marks in the Big West. He has been the biggest force in helping the Aggies reach an 11-6 overall mark and 2-1 conference record so far this season. Also, the brighter the stage, the bigger Moneke shines and stands out, allowing for his team to continue thriving and relying on their senior captain. In a game against Pac-12 opponent Washington State, Moneke finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds to lead UC Davis to the victory. Even with being picked to finish second in the conference by the media, there is no doubt that the Aggies will be tough to beat and will be on everyone's mind come tournament time. UC Davis continues its run in Big West play against Hawaii on Saturday, Jan. 20. UC Riverside Highlanders by Andrew Bishop The UC Riverside Highlanders entered their 2017-18 season hoping to bounce back from a disappointing 2016-17 campaign that culminated in a record of 7-21. The Highlanders had a hot start, going 3-0 during a brief tour in Quebec, and upsetting Pac-12 powerhouse UC Berkeley on the road. Despite early successes, the remainder of the Highlanders' season has been nothing short of turbulent. The Highlanders entered conference play with a record of 5-9, and shortly after, parted ways with their head coach of 5 years, Dennis Cutts. They are now 5-13 overall and remain winless in conference play at 0-4. Cutts went 50-87 at the helm of UC Riverside's men's basketball team, and was succeeded by Associate Head Coach Justin Bell, who will serve as the team's interim head coach until a replacement is hired. Bell, a UC Riverside alumnus, has struggled to lead his team to victory in all of their four conference games, putting the Highlanders at 0-4 in the Big West. Throughout the season, the Highlanders have distributed their point production somewhat evenly amongst their starters. Sophomore guard Dikymbe Martin has emerged as the team's leader in scoring, averaging 13.1 points per game. The Highlanders have also relied heavily on their veteran players on offense, with redshirt senior guard Chance Murray and senior forward Alex Larsson averaging 10.8 and 10.6 points per game, respectively. While the Highlanders have boasted solid performances from a few key players, it is clear that it will take more for them to be successful in the Big West. Bell and his players will look for their first conference win against UC Irvine next Wednesday, Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. on ESPN3.

sports,Under the Scope: 2017-18 Big West Women's Basketball Preview,18-Jan-18,5:05 AM,"['Calvin Thrift', 'Andrew Hernandez', 'Richard Benites', 'Sean White', 'Jorge Mercado', 'Brandon Victor', 'Kendra Jackson', 'Spencer Ault', 'Andrew Bishop']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-18/under-the-scope-2017-18-big-west-womens-basketball-preview/,"Sean White / Daily Nexus UC Santa Barbara ""ì Calvin Thrift The regular season has come and gone for the UCSB women's basketball team, with head coach Bonnie Henrickson now faced with the task of guiding her squad to learn from regular season mistakes as the Big West conference continues. The Gauchos, second in Big West standings, are 6-10 overall following a rough start to the season featuring difficult matchups with Pac-12 foes UCLA and Oregon State. Despite the team's sub-par record at this point, the Gauchos are looking for progress and another come-from-behind conference season. Four games in, it looks like Santa Barbara is on the right track. Heading into conference play last season featured Santa Barbara sitting at 5-8; however, the Gauchos came alive in Big West play, going 9-7 and improving to 16-16 overall to close out the season at .500. UCSB went on to compete against Long Beach State in the Big West Championship, falling just short of the 49ers. While there have certainly been rough patches through Santa Barbara's 2017-2018 campaign thus far, the Gauchos have demonstrated continual improvement. Improvement that, if continued, will perhaps carry Santa Barbara to another successful run in the Big West. ""úI'm process-oriented, I'm not result oriented. If you focus on just a result, you're not going to address the process element of the result. So for us, continuing to grow stretches where we play well and execute and we have the effort and the energy and the attention to detail it takes to be successful,""ù Henrickson said. ""úThen shrink the stretches of the opposite of that where we've not been disciplined, we've not been dialed in and not brought energy.""ù While turnovers remain a frustrating stat for UCSB, the Gauchos are finding ways to win. In their victory over New Mexico State, the Gauchos turned the ball over 22 times in spite of winning by 30 points. In the close win against rival Cal Poly, UCSB committed 33 turnovers. Santa Barbara's averaging 17.8 turnovers per game this season, but 19.3 in conference play. Despite turnover woes, the Gauchos have been finding their rhythm offensively as they work the ball inside to redshirt senior Drew Edelman more effectively. Edelman is having an even better year than last season and that's with her early battles with various injuries. The 6'4 forward is posting a statline of 14.3 points per game, which is almost four more points than she averaged last season, to go along with 9.4 boards. When simply looking at Santa Barbara's results this season, it may be easy to dismiss the Gauchos in favor of Big West teams with better records. But, it is the constant adjustment as well as overall improvement that carries a team through a season, which Henrickson understands. ""úGood players and good teams find success and get better because they eliminate the things that don't work and bad teams stay bad because they continue to do the things that don't work,""ù said Henrickson. ""ú[The Big West] is really good, young, fun and talented and exciting.""ù With momentum and anticipation of Big West competition, the Gauchos will certainly be put to the test as they seek to improve the process rather than simply the result. Long Beach State ""ì Andrew Hernandez
 The 2017-2018 season has not been kind to the 49ers of the Long Beach State women's basketball team so far. The team's overall record of 2-16 is a far cry from the 9-6 record the team had at the end of its non-conference schedule last season. The 49ers have had difficulty establishing a winning rhythm, and are winless at 0-4 in conference play. The team had eight players, including four seniors, leave from last year's squad but were able to fill the spots by bringing seven freshmen to the team. Among those freshmen were Ma'Qhi Berry, Shanaijah Davison and Emma Merriweather, who have done their best to make their impact on the team felt. Each player has scored 100+ points so far this season, but the team has still found themselves coming up short. The 49ers' last win came on Dec. 7 in an exciting game that came down to the final minutes when senior Cecily Wilson put LBSU ahead by six with a layup. The 49ers were able to hold off GCU until time expired. Wilson is the only senior present within the team's top four scorers and currently leads the 49ers in rebounds, averaging 6.6 a game. The veteran presence on the team has certainly taken a dive due to last year's departures, but Wilson has shown that the team has the potential to do well given their significant amount of youth and guidance from the more experienced members of the team. ""úIn order for us to be successful in conference play, we have to be more consistent on both ends off the floor. We have to stay disciplined and maintain our effort for 40 min,""ù Head Coach Jeff Cammon said. ""úTo be specific, limit second chance opportunities by boxing out/rebounding on defensive end. Lastly, we have to take care of the ball and value possessions on [the] offensive end. This conference is tough, and we have to have a competitive mentality every night.""ù The 49ers will host UCSB Saturday, Jan. 20 at 4 p.m. Cal Poly ""ì Richard Benites Following last season's below average 7-9 record in Big West conference play, the Cal Poly women's basketball team entered this year with something to prove. Now 8-7 overall, the Mustangs will try to find areas in which they can improve their game. They currently hold a conference record of 2-1 as the Big West competition unfurls. After ending third to last in the previous Big West regular season, Cal Poly's Head Coach Faith Mimnaugh will want to return to major tournament play during her 21st season in the manager role and after four appearances in either the NCAA Tournament or WNIT since 2011. To help achieve this she'll look to her most veteran players for help on reaching this team goal. Trying to improve upon last season's seeding of No. 7 overall, Cal Poly has already started off on the right foot with their 2-1 record that places them in a tie for third overall in the Big West conference standings. Three Cal Poly players to keep an eye on as the regular season rolls on would be junior center Devin Stanback, senior forward Emily Anderson and senior guard Dynn Leaupepe, who are all statistical leaders in their own individual Big West categories. After coming off their most recent 84-71 win at home against the CSUN women's basketball program, hopes are high for what this Cal Poly women's basketball squad can truly accomplish. Made up of mostly returning upperclasswomen, spearheaded by Mimnaugh's stellar coaching talents and a familiar game scheme aimed at success; this side expects at the very least a deep playoff run as it continues to progress into the 2017-18 campaign. Cal Poly will host UC Davis this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 2 p.m. Cal State Fullerton ""ì Sean White
 Fullerton's 1-15 conference record last season was the third time in program history that it finished with just one win in conference play. CSUF's 16-16 record in 2006-07 was its last time ending a season with an overall record of .500 or above, and its 8-7 conference finish was its last conference winning record. Ultimately, such results led to the hiring of Head Coach Jeff Harada. In his first year, he has already helped the Titans eclipse their conference win total of last season. Sitting at 7-10, 2-2 in the Big West, the Titans are tied for fourth place in the conference. With no Big West Tournament appearances in the last two years, the Titans' time to rise may be near. ""úI think the biggest thing I've learned this year has been patience. As a coach we are all very competitive by nature and want to win every game we play right away,""ù Harada said. ""úUnderstanding the history and state of our program, my goal is obviously to change that, but I have to remind myself that it's not going to happen overnight. It truly is a process. Turning those small victories into bigger ones will hopefully take us where we want to be in the future.""ù Key factors within this process are junior guards Hannah Thompson and Jade Vega, who both rank in the top 10 of the Big West in scoring with averages of 12 PPG. Only time will tell if Fullerton can manage to put together a run that will secure a spot within the Big West Tournament. Until then, we wait for March. Cal State Northridge ""ì Brandon Victor
 Despite losing its first five games of the season, the Cal State Northridge women's basketball team looks like it could possibly contend for the Big West title. CSUN (8-9, 1-2) recovered from its tough start by ripping off four straight wins, however, things have slightly declined considering the Matadors' current two-game losing streak after defeating Cal State Fullerton in their first conference game of the season, 70-68. Despite the team's recent slump, the presence of junior center Channon Fluker could possibly catapult the Matadors up the conference standings. Fluker, who was named the Big West Player of the Year last season, became the second player in Big West history to lead the conference in scoring, rebounding and blocks. In 17 games played this season, she has recorded eight double-doubles while averaging a conference leading 20.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. Fluker even recorded a triple-double during the team's Dec. 30 game against Seattle, scoring 28 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, all while setting a conference record with 13 blocks en route to a 67-62 victory. ""úOur biggest strengths this season are our post play, depth and rebounding,""ù Head Coach Jason Flower said. The team will need to improve its late-game execution if it hopes to compete for the conference title this season. Other than a 48-point drubbing by Oregon to start the season, all of CSUN's losses have been by single digits this season. CSUN's next match is against Cal State Fullerton at¬† 7p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18 at the Matadome. UC Irvine ""ì Andrew Bishop
 Second-year Head Coach Tamara Inoue and her players entered the 2017-18 season with one goal in mind: to leave their 2016-17 season behind. Last year, the Anteaters went a paltry 5-26, with only three wins against conference opponents. ""úLast year I took over a team that was mainly senior-based,""ù Inoue said. ""úThey did a good job, we just couldn't finish games.""ù One of the biggest problems Inoue faced going into this season was rebuilding a team that had recently lost a number of key seniors. ""úI had to replace a lot just because I was losing a lot,""ù she said. ""úA lot of the players from last year aren't here this season, so it's been a fresh start.""ù Irvine's younger players have shared the bulk of the scoring throughout the majority of the season, with the help of sophomore guards Lauren Saiki (8.7 points per game) and Yazzy Sa'Dullah (7.7 points per game), and freshman forward Jordan Sanders (8.1 points per game). Irvine has also been supported in recent games by redshirt junior transfer guard Morgan Green, who made her Anteater debut on Jan. 4 against UC Davis. Green was sidelined throughout Irvine's 2016-17 season, and the non-conference portion of its 2017-18 season due to NCAA transfer regulations. Despite suffering a loss to current conf. leader UC Davis in her first game as an Anteater, Green has lit up the scoreboard in her three appearances, averaging 22.7 points per game. The Anteaters are coming off of a 77-74 win against UCSB which puts them at 2-1 in conference play. They will hope to add to their win total and continue their comeback season as they face Cal Poly this Thursday, Jan. 18 at 7 p.m. Hawaii ""ì Jorge Mercado
 The 2017-18 season has been an odd one for the Hawaii women's basketball team. After going 7-6 in non-conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were poised to make some noise come Big West play. Unfortunately for them, that has yet to be the case. Hawaii began conference play with three straight losses, with two on the road, but rebounded in their most recent effort in a home win against last place Long Beach State to have a 1-3 mark at this point in the conference season. They are currently in eighth place in the Big West standings. Offensively, Hawaii has some good talent. They currently possess the second-best shooting percentage in the conference at 40.8 and average 64.3 points per game. Their leading scorer has been senior guard Sarah Toeaina, who was named to the Preseason All-Conference team by both the media and the coaches. She currently averages 14.1 points per contest. The only other player on the team averaging double figures is sophomore guard Julissa Tago, who is scoring 10.8 points per contest. The preseason poll had both coaches and the media expecting the Rainbow Wahine to finish in fourth place; however, with the struggles the team has going for them so far, there is no doubt there needs to be some work done before that prediction could become a reality. If there is one thing Hawaii has going for them, it is that they are currently 6-4 at home; however, now that Big West play is in full swing, they will need to shore up that defense on the road as well if they want to have some success. Hawaii's next match is against UCR on Thursday, Jan. 18, at 5 p.m. UC Davis ""ì Spencer Ault
 The UC Davis women's basketball team entered the Big West Tournament with high hopes last season. UCSB brought those hopes crashing to the ground in the semifinals, defeating the Aggies 73-59 before falling to Long Beach State 56-55 in the finals. Disappointed as it was, UC Davis managed to bounce back in the WNIT. The Aggies advanced to the Sweet 16 after beating Utah and Colorado State, before falling to Washington State. Building off that postseason success, the Aggies are 13-3, and kicked off their season with ten straight wins. One of those wins came over Washington State in an impressive 91-76 victory that displayed how the Aggies have in fact improved from last year's strong season. UCD's success has continued in Big West play as well, as the team has gone 3-0 with victories over Irvine, Riverside and Hawaii. Redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch has borne the bulk of the scoring load for UCD with 19.8 points per game. Bertsch was named to the first-team All-Big West last season, and is on pace to earn a repeat of the honor on this go around. Senior forward Pele Gianotti joined Bertsch on that team last season. Gianotti has been effective this season as well with around ten points per game and a team-high 5.9 rebounds per game. Senior guard Rachel Nagel is next in line for scoring with 11.6 points per game, and has knocked down 42.6 percent of her three point attempts. That's not the highest mark on the team, an honor that goes to senior guard Dani Nafekh, but it's still a marksman-like percentage. UCD will have its first chance to redeem its semifinal upset loss when it takes on the Gauchos on Thursday, Jan. 18 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. UC Riverside ""ì Kendra Jackson
 The UC Riverside Highlanders are 5-13 overall and are currently 2-2 in Big West conference play. With a 3-4 record at home, the team has only managed to reign victorious away from the confines of the UCR Student Recreation Center once this season. In hindsight, when considering the team's progress last season, the Highlanders ended as the fourth seed in the Big West tournament. With a 16-15 record overall and 9-7 in conference play, the initial first round matchup for UCR turned out to be the eighth seeded UC Irvine Anteaters. In terms of moving forward, UCR can still set its sights on a legitimate playoff run if it focuses on improving its record in conference play and dedicating itself to winning games not just at home, but also while on the road. With a playmaker like senior guard Michelle Curry running the show and redshirt sophomore forward Skyler Lewis collecting the boards, UCR definitely has the talent to right the ship. Curry averages 15.5 points per game, fourth best mark in the conference while Lewis averages 7.6 rebounds per game, also the fourth best mark in the Big West. As it stands now, the Highlanders are the sixth seed, but conference play has just begun and there is plenty of time to improve, especially since UCR is not too far behind Cal State Fullerton in the standings. If their conference play begins to excel, they can make a splash in the Big West. Coming off its most recent win against the CSUF at home in which senior guard Lauren Holt dropped 22 points, UCR is set to ride that momentum when it takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 18. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 18, 2018, edition of the¬†Daily Nexus.

sports,2018 NFL Playoffs: Conference Championship Preview,19-Jan-18,7:06 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-19/2018-nfl-playoffs-conference-championship-preview/,"Following a very intense Divisional round, in this 2018 NFL Playoffs, upsets and nail biters seemed to be the recurring theme as professional football was at its finest display last weekend. Now, the Conference Championship round is upon us as teams will fight to secure a spot to play in Super Bowl 52, come February 4th. Only four teams remain; three of which have starting quarterbacks that most would have never expected them to reach this far ever in their careers, the other one being perhaps the greatest to have ever graced the game. The nation will be watching as football fans everywhere will be expecting a treat as players will go duke it out in order to keep their Super Bowl dreams alive. NFC Championship Match @ Lincoln Financial Field Minnesota Vikings With perhaps the most well rounded unit all season long, the Vikings No. 1 defense will be Nick Foles and the Eagles offense's greatest match yet. With a total of three Pro Bowl defensive studs of defensive end Everson Griffen, linebacker Anthony Barr, and cornerback Xavier Rhodes, a fast tempo style of play that can get the job done on both the air and ground is to be expected. Skol, Vikings will be sung by fans far and wide as they hope their defense can continue to dominate and make it past this final hump; all in hopes of becoming the first team to ever host and play in the same Super Bowl. However, defense alone won't be enough this late in the playoffs, but that's definitely not an issue for Case Keenum and company. X-Factor: Vikings Receivers Speaking of Pro Bowlers, wide receiver Adam Thielen also made such a coveted list and rightfully so. Running routes flawlessly almost all year and being able to beat man to man coverage against practically any cornerback in the league; this was truly Thielen's breakout year. At 6'3""ù and 201 pounds, Case Keenum will look often towards his WR1's way. And where will he look otherwise? Oh yeah, at his just as elite second option of Stefon Diggs or tight end red-zone target Kyle Rudolph. Buckle up Eagles secondary, it's going to be a bumpy ride. Philadelphia Eagles The primary reason the game venue was even listed in this section for the NFC Championship game was for exactly this: Eagles fans; more specifically, the near impossibility of performing well in the hostile environment known as Lincoln Financial Field. With freezing cold temperatures, very powerful wind speeds, and a horde of deafening fans, the Eagles have managed a 9-1 record at home all season long. Arguably, Philadelphia's defense is perhaps one of the few teams that can even be compared toe to toe with the Vikings. The only difference, however, being that the Eagles boast the best defensive line in the league. Brandon Graham, Fletcher Cox, Timmy Jernigan, Vinny Curry, Chris Long, Derek Barnett""¶this list that spans into a very deep depth chart seems almost endless. This roster truly feels almost larger than life, and Case Keenum will surely be in for a rude awakening if he thinks he'll get away with half of the stuff he's been able to do to other opposing defenses. Although this is shaping out to be a defensive battle on both ends of the field, the Eagles will also look to their offense for early on and continued success. X-Factor: Eagles Running Backs Planning on stopping a speedy and powerful Jay ""úTrain""ù Ajayi then attempting to halt a 6'0""ù 250 lbs. LeGarrette Blount on short yardage/red-zone plays? Good luck with that. Since Ajayi's trade deadline week addition, this dominant duo has been bruising defenses left and right. Their roles recently picked up substantially, due to an unfortunate halt on Wentz's MVP-like season, and so far fans have been impressed. In order for the Eagles offense to even succeed against a stout Vikings rush defense, head coach Doug Pederson will have to continue his unpredictable play calling abilities whilst allowing both Ajayi and Blount to move the chains early on. Prediction: The Eagles make use of their home-field advantage and upset an elite Vikings side""¶Eagles win 20-17.† AFC Championship Match @ Gillette Stadium Jacksonville Jaguars After losing star wide receiver Allen Robinson early on in the season to injury, many critics and fans alike looked at this Jaguars offensive depth chart and couldn't find much to be excited about. Then, Blake Bortles happened. Sure he didn't have much of an extraordinary or standout season, yet, he got the job done week in and week out, and that can't be said about the majority of starting quarterbacks in the league so props to him. Oh, and don't forget about Leonard Fournette, because he's been able to embarrass defenders and leave them in the dust all season long; e.g. the unprepared Steelers defense at home who allowed 45 total points. However, this offense still isn't the signature piece that symbolizes its underdog mentality in the face of adversity. It's the defensive secondary in the face of Tom Brady's receivers. X-Factor: Jaguars Cornerbacks Here's a scenario: who do you throw to when your playmakers are being covered by two Pro Bowl cornerbacks? Even if you're quarterback's name is Tom Brady, teams will have to game plan for several years to come if the names A.J. Bouye and Jalen Ramsey are lined up on the opposite side. These two have stood face to face with the best of the best, and have still come out on top. Up to now, Ramsey and Bouye have combined for a whopping 11 interceptions this year. Considering they've also proven that they're clutch when it counts the most, kind of like that game ending clutch during the Wild Card matchup versus the Bills, it's probably best for Patriots head coach Bill Belichick to pay extra attention and second guess that deep throw option. New England Patriots Many things can be said about the Patriots, you could love them or hate them, but wow; 7 straight AFC Championship game appearances, really? Well when you have the greatest of all time Tom Brady playing for you, success is almost expected at this point. Playing still at age 40, Brady has returned with a star receiving corps and plans on shutting the door on the Jaguars' playoff hopes. With Brandin Cooks, Chris Hogan, and his favorite target Rob Gronkowski, Brady will have to fling the pigskin fast and true across the field if he wants to get it past Jacksonville without taking a sack. Or maybe he'll just check it down to his team's X Factor, the New England backfield. X-Factor: Patriots Backfield Normally one would refer to the backfield as just a team's running backs. However, considering how unorthodox Belichick manages backfield rotations, it just might be enough to catch the Jaguars off guard. With Dion Lewis running downing the middle, Rex Burkhead catching out the backfield, and James White lining up wide, this particular Patriots unit is both surprising and successful. Don't forget about fullback James Develin either, as he's been able to block pretty much anyone when it comes to goal line situations. Ultimately, this game will be a fun one to watch as a crafty offense goes up against a convincing defense. One will end up on top, but the real weekend winners here are the lucky NFL fans who get to watch. Prediction: Tom Brady throws for 3 touchdowns and the Patriots return to the holy grail of football games""¶Patriots win 21-10.

sports,UCSB Faces Pepperdine in First Road Match of 2018,19-Jan-18,2:27 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-19/ucsb-faces-pepperdine-in-first-road-match-of-2018/,"Three games into the season, the UCSB men's volleyball team rolls onward into its first road match of the year.  The Gauchos have so far shown plenty to be excited about following their 3-0 thrashing at home versus the No. 8 Stanford during the Asics Invitational. Now, the 2-1 Gauchos will head on the road to Pepperdine University for their fourth match of the non-conference stretch. The Pepperdine Men's Volleyball program is currently 1-1 on the year and are coming off their most recent 1-3 loss to UC Irvine. Current Pepperdine players to keep an eye on would be outside hitting seniors Alex Harthaller and Colby Harriman. At 6'6""ù, Harthaller is second on the overall kill point count for his team at 22 so far on the season; he also averages a 3.67 kill per set ratio along with a hitting percentage of .286.  Meanwhile, Harriman leads Pepperdine with a first place kill point count of 24; paired with a 3.43 kill per set ratio and a .204 hitting percentage. These two players have so far proven that they are reliable targets when it comes to getting points up on the board.  Look for new primary setter Robert Mullahey to get them going early as the 6'4""ù squad athlete will look to get his two outside hitters going early on. With 80 assists through his first two games, watch for the game script to revolve around his success or lack thereof. As for the Gauchos, their two starting outside hitters have also been very productive. Sophomore Roy McFarland and junior Corey Chavers both lead as well in the kill point count for UCSB.  McFarland currently tallies a total of 33 kills, a 3.00 kill per set ratio, and an impressive hitting percentage of .397. As for his teammate, Chavers leads his team unit with 36 overall; including a 3.27 kill per set ratio, and a .240 hitting percentage.  In terms of their setters, UCSB have been rotating in and out two different players in Randy DeWeese and Casey McGarry. So far DeWeese has received the bulk of control with a total of 62 assists on the season; whereas McGarry is following close behind at 50 assists overall. Historically speaking, UCSB hasn't had much success over Pepperdine considering their all time record of 38-68. Last year even featured a 1-3 loss for the Gauchos where they were also on the road against Pepperdine. In terms of current Gaucho standings, the team ranks 3rd in the Big West conference for both the statistical categories of blocking, 2.64 per game, and digs, 8.36 per game.  Nationally speaking however, these Gaucho scoring stats have also booked them a top-15 standing in blocking at No. 7, No. 11 in attacks per game with 27.6, and No. 12 in serving with 1.73 aces per game. Overall, the UCSB Men's Volleyball team is shaping up to be something special this year.  Considering their Big West competitors of Long Beach State, CSUN, and Hawai'i are currently all undefeated so far in preseason play, the Gauchos still have a while to go before asserting league dominance; not to mention that UC Irvine and UC San Diego are also both above a .800 win percentage. UCSB will face off away from home this Saturday, January 20th, at 6 PM; the host Pepperdine will hold the match in their Firestone Fieldhouse athletic facility. † † † Comments are closed.

sports,Full-Court Vision: UC Davis Comes Back To Beat UCSB's Women's Basketball,21-Jan-18,11:56 PM,"['Johnny Mandaville', 'Jorge Mercado']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-21/full-court-vision-uc-davis-comes-back-to-beat-ucsbs-womens-basketball/," Normally games are a tale of two halves, this one, was a game of two quarter. The UCSB women's basketball team dropped its second consecutive match after losing to UC Davis, 68-61 at home Wednesday night. UCSB now drops to 6-11 on the season, 3-2 in conference play while first place UCD now improves to 14-3 overall and a still unbeaten 4-0 mark in Big West play. Santa Barbara began the night off strong jumping out to a very early 15-8 lead following six points from junior forward Drew Edelman. However, UC Davis would bounce back with two baskets before the end of the quarter to only go down three points heading into the second. The Aggies then took their first lead of the night following a 4-0 run to begin the second to take the lead at 16-15 before Tal Sahar nailed a three to put the Gauchos back on top. After that however, it was all UC Davis who used a 16-6 run until the end of the second to take a 32-24 lead into the break. In the first quarter, the Gauchos had redshirt Morgan Bertsch held to zero points, but the Aggies star came alive in the second scoring eight points to help give her team the eight-point lead heading into the break. The third quarter began with UCSB and UC Davis trading buckets. With around four minutes remaining in the third, and UCSB down four, the Gauchos put together an 8-0 run to take a 48-43 lead. Like the first, the Aggies scored the final four points of the quarter to go down by just one heading into the fourth. Much like the second, in the final frame, Santa Barbara just could not buy a basket. After a make by senior guard Drea Toler which made the score 50-47 with 8:04 on the clock, UC Davis scored the next 12 points, fueled by a pair of three-pointers from junior guard Karley Eaton, to go up 59-50. UCSB tried to fight back with three points from freshman guard Sarah Bates and Toler but UC Davis was great from the charity stripe down the stretch, sealing the Gauchos fate as they lost 68-61 at the final buzzer. Neither team shot the three-ball particularly well, with the Gauchos hitting on just 25 percent (7-for-28) while the Aggies went 4-for-23 (17.4 percent) from beyond the arc. Overall, UC Davis went 26-for-58 (44.8 percent) from the field compared to a 33.9 percent (21-for-62) shooting night for UCSB. Bertsch, despite shooting under her season average, still tallied a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds and was a huge factor down the strech. Following two straight losses, albeit competitive ones, the Gauchos now know they need to make some quick fixes if they dont want to fall into a deep losing streak like they did earlier this season. Luckily, the return of a guard like Toler could provide the offense a much needed passing boost. She finished with a team-high 15 points in her home debut. UCSB is back in action on Saturday against Long Beach State.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus After pushing back the start of the season two weeks due to curriculum changes, wildfires and mudslides, the UCSB men's tennis team will finally open its season this Friday in Southern California against SMU as part of the 2018 ITA Kickoff Weekend. The Gauchos, who will look to win their fourth consecutive Big West title this season, will be aided by the return of four of their top six singles players from last season, including junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and senior leader Simon Freund. Last season, Moreno de Alboran finished with a singles record of 19-12 and also posted an 6-5 record in the No. 1 spot for the Gauchos, a spot he will most likely start in this entire year. He also played alongside junior Anders Holm in doubles play as the duo finished the season with a 15-6 mark. Due to his wonderful play, Moreno de Alboran received All-Big West honors in both singles and doubles play last season. Following a very successful fall season, including becoming the first Gaucho to receive an invitational to the ITA Fall National Championships, Moreno de Alboran is ranked No. 42 in the ITA top 150 singles players in the country. Freund returns for his senior season following a 19-8 record in singles play as well as winning every single conference match. Freund was awarded All-Big West second team honors for singles, and All-Big West first team honors for doubles. Alongside Moreno de Alboran, the two claimed the 2016 Jack Kramer Invitational Doubles Championship becoming the first Gaucho duo to claim the trophy. UCSB also returns Holm and senior Chase Masciorini this season. Holm recorded the best winning percentage of any Gaucho last season, going 20-5 and earning All-Big West second team honors. Masciorini finished last season with a 17-12 record, and is yet another reliable starter for the Gauchos despite some spotty play during the fall season. SMU enters the match looking to end their two-game losing skid as it currently sits at 1-2 to begin the season. They beat Abilene Christian 4-0 in their first match before losing to Harvard in heartbreaking fashion, 4-3. In their latest match, SMU got handled by No. 8 Texas, 4-0. The Mustangs finished last season ranked No. 38 in the nation but are a relatively young team this year, featuring seven newcomers. In addition, SMU lost their top three players from last season ""î Ronald Slobodchikov, Hunter Johnson and Yates Johnson ""î to graduation. They will need their returning standouts such as senior Charles Nettlefold and redshirt freshman Gardiner Perotti to step up in order to compete with the Gauchos. The last time the two teams played, back in 2015, SMU defeated UCSB 6-1. With a win, Santa Barbara will then take on the winner of the match between USC or Indiana, also being played on Saturday. If the Gauchos can take down SMU, they will likely face USC, who currently resides as the No. 5 team in the nation and is a favorite to beat unranked Indiana. The Trojans have three players currently ranked in the top 100, including Brandon Holt (11), Logan Smith (54), and Thibault Forget (96). Holt actually defeated Freund earlier this season at the Southern California Intercollegiate in two sets, and USC would present a stark early-season challenge for UCSB should they face them. The Trojans finished last season 27-6, including a 16-0 home record. Indiana routed Ball State and Eastern Illinois in their first two matches, before losing to Memphis 5-2. The Hoosiers went 13-13 last year, but also acquired most of their losses in the highly competitive Big Ten. Indiana is led by Senior Raheel Manji, who was ranked 125th in the country in the latest ITA singles rankings. Either way, Santa Barbara will look to acquire a signature early season win in their second match of the season. Despite having their first three matches of the season pushed back due to the natural disasters, the Gauchos still boast a strong returning core, and should prove to be competitive in their first two matches of the season. UCSB will begin its season at 2 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 26, against SMU at Marks Tennis Stadium at USC. The Gauchos will play either USC or Indiana the following day with the time to be determined.

sports,Gauchos Travel to Indiana for Hoosier Invitational,25-Jan-18,5:34 AM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/gauchos-travel-to-indiana-for-hoosier-invitational/,"Nexus File Photo The women's water polo team will be traveling to Bloomington, Indiana to play the first game of the Hoosier Invitational.  The tournament features teams from across the country as well as internationally with five other universities participating in the three-day event. The Gauchos open up play against the University of Toronto Varsity Blues on Friday.  Heading into the tournament the Gauchos are 3-2 with their most recent game ending in a 5 point victory against the Fresno State Bulldogs, 12-7. The Gauchos struggles this season have come against extremely talented, ranked teams like No. 8 Michigan and No. 2 UCLA.  The team was able to keep it close but lost by less than five points in both of the games, by three against the Wolverines and four against the Bruins. Leading the charge for the team has been a trio of players who have been key to the Gauchos' offensive success. Juniors Sarah Kreiser and Kate Pipken, as well as sophomore Natalie Selin. Pipken leads the team in points with 21 while Kreiser and Selin are tied for second most points on the team with 14.  Pipken has been a particularly dynamic player for the squad as 11 of her 21 points are assists while the other ten are goals scored. Kreiser is the team's highest goal scorer with 11 while Selin has obtained her points more evenly between the assists and goals category with eight goals and six assists. Kreiser has been consistently successful offensively in five tournament games by scoring in each one and recently gained Big West Player of the Week honors. Together the trio have been offensive centerpieces for UCSB while also providing steady defense. The Toronto Varsity Blues are also looking to make a deep, successful run in the Invitational, despite it being their first ever appearance.  The team is riding a large wave of momentum as the Blues beat the McMaster Marauders 11-2 to become National Collegiate Water Polo Champions.  Senior Ana Miroslavic played spectacularly, scoring a hat trick in the final game, and is surely looking to continue this kind of performance in the team's first game in Bloomington. The Gauchos are coming off of five days rest after completing another tournament on January 21 and will hop right back into the grind with five games scheduled over three days.  Despite the flurry of games the Gauchos will benefit from a long break before resuming play again on February 10 in San Diego.  The trio and the rest of the team are approaching this tournament hoping to show their ability to handle a tough schedule on the road.  With a long break in sight the Gauchos can truly put everything they have into these next tournament games and a positive result will be a great sign headed into the midpoint of the season. The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play the University of Toronto Varsity Blues at Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatic Center in Bloomington, Indiana on January 26 at 7 PM EST. Comments are closed.

Now, the team is looking forward to its Thursday matchup at No. 7 Loyola University Chicago. The Gauchos sit at 3-1 and are looking impressive as they're coming off a 3-1 victory over Pepperdine on the road. Overall, the game was intense as the two teams exchanged points, resulting in small differences in which side won each set as UCSB went on to take a 28-26, 21-25, 25-22 and 25-23 win. The match featured a dominant performance by junior outside hitter Corey Chavers had a game-leading 24 kills on the attack. To make this night even more special for Chavers, he was soon after awarded with Big West Player of the Week recognition for the first time ever in his career. Meanwhile, the Loyola Wolves are also experiencing some early non-conference success as they currently find themselves at a 4-2 overall. The Wolves, as well as the Gauchos, currently hold a two-game win streak. Notably, the Wolves have swept their last two opponents. Concerning their most recent match, Loyola is coming off a 3-0 thrashing over Saint Francis University, whom they hosted last Saturday. Thus far, the Wolves are 0-2 against Big West teams as they lost 3-1 to No. 6 UC Irvine and were swept 3-0 by No. 1 Long Beach State. Statistically, the Wolves have been clinical when it comes to attacking possessions. Totaling 272 kills on 94 errors, compared to their opponents' 258 kills on 112 errors, Loyola has gotten it done with the exact same number of opportunities that they've offered to opposing sides, a total attack count of 607. At the forefront of Loyola's attack is junior outside hitter Collin Mahan. At 6'5 Mahan has a team-high 76 kills. Mahan also boasts a 3.45 kill per set ratio. Supporting him is senior middle blocker Jeff Jendryk, who has a total kill count of 46. Helping put both in a scoring position is freshman setter Garret Zolg, who stands at 6'3 and leads in team assists with a total of 188 on the year. So far, Loyola has had one key game in which they faced off and bested the formerly No. 3 BYU, who are now fifth within the NCAA rankings. The Gauchos will want to assert dominance early on and continue to get the ball to their outside hitters as effectively as they've recently done with Chavers. This game might surprisingly turn out to be a close one, but it surely will surely result in great competition as UCSB searches to extend their latest win streak. UCSB will head out on the road to take on Loyola University Chicago this Thursday, Jan. 25 this at 7 p.m. at Gentile Arena.

sports,"UCSB Faces Big West Best UC Davis, Hopes to Split Season Series",25-Jan-18,5:10 AM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/ucsb-faces-big-west-best-uc-davis-hopes-to-split-season-series/,"Nexus File Photo Following its 90-74 win over Long Beach State this past weekend, the UCSB women's basketball team is currently in second place in the Big West at 4-2 while also putting up a 7-11 overall mark thus far. For a team that once suffered a nine-game losing streak earlier this season, UCSB has come alive in conference play and continues to flash signs of maturity and improvement that could lead to the first Big West title in the Bonnie Henrickson era. As conference play continues, Santa Barbara will look to benefit from its week-long break between games in preparation for the Gauchos' highly-anticipated matchup with 15-3 UC Davis. At 5-0 in the Big West, the Aggies are undefeated in conference play thus far and boast a 7-1 record at home. While the Gauchos lost to Davis at home on Thursday, Jan. 18, 68-61, Santa Barbara's big win over Long Beach State signals its persistence. In Saturday's road win against Long Beach, Drew Edelman and Sarah Bates combined for 45 of the Gauchos' 90 points. Edelman, a redshirt senior, posted her 23 points off her most efficient night shooting the ball this season (10-plus field goal attempts). The 6'4 forward shot 10-of-13 from the field and went a perfect 3-3 from the free-throw line, her fifth game this season being perfect from the line. As Edelman continues to control the paint with an average of 14.7 points per game and 9.2 rebounds per game, guard Sarah Bates has kept up her stellar performance, which is especially impressive for a freshman. Bates is Santa Barbara's second-leading scorer behind Edelman with 10.6 PPG and is also the most efficient shooter from three-point range in the conference shooting 44.7 percent. In the win over LBSU, the freshman guard went 6-9 from behind the arc for her career high in three pointers made. Also second on the UCSB roster in minutes played with 27.1 minutes, Bates has been an impact player both during the regular season and in Big West play. If the Gauchos hope to end UC Davis' five-game winning streak, they'll have to get better performances than their last meeting with the Aggies from the rest of their roster. In their first matchup played just one week ago, UC Davis visited the Thunderdome and came away with the victory in large part due to holding Edelman to only six field goals. Plaguing the Gauchos on that night was their shooting. Ending the game shooting 33.9 percent overall and 25 percent from three, UCSB will certainly aim to find the net more efficiently Saturday in Davis. Only losing by a close seven points, Santa Barbara has a feasible chance to redeem itself, but the Aggies have some weapons of their own. Averaging 19.4 points per game this season, redshirt junior Morgan Bertsch has been part of the Aggies' success. Bertsch, a 6'4 forward, has led Davis in scoring in 15 games this season and produced a 16-point and 10-rebound double-double in the last meeting with the Gauchos. Despite struggling at the beginning of the night against the Gauchos, Bertsch was a key cog in helping UC Davis seal the win scoring six points, collecting three rebounds and assisting on two baskets in the fourth quarter of the match. Also hurting the Gauchos in that game was Aggie Pele Gianotti, who scored 15 points despite missing all six of her three point attempts. Gianotti, a senior forward, is averaging 10.1 points per contest and leads her team in rebounding, averaging 5.8 boards per game. Santa Barbara will need to make the necessary defensive adjustments against Davis in order to limit Gianotti's and Bertsch's production, but the Aggies will undoubtedly be ready to compete in the clash of the top-two Big West teams. Just one year ago, UCSB was the team that upset UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Semifinal. The Aggies have not forgotten that, and a regular season sweep of the Gauchos will be a good token of revenge. UCSB will take on UC Davis at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 27, at The Pavilion in Davis, CA. A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 25, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Coming off another blowout victory at home, the UCSB men's basketball team looks to extend their winning streak to three against Cal State Fullerton on Thursday evening. This will be the second time in the last week that the Gauchos and the Titans face off, with Santa Barbara having the 1-0 advantage after its 83-64 victory last Wednesday. Cal State Fullerton currently sits two spots ahead of the Gauchos at second place in the Big West with an 11-7 overall, 4-2 conference record. UCSB has a better overall record at 14-5, but two blown leads have set them back a little bit in the Big West, where their 3-2 record is good for fourth place. UCSB also comes into the game ranked No. 17 in the most recent Collegeinsider.com Mid-Major Poll. The Titans received three votes but ultimately couldn't join the Gauchos as the only other Big West team on the list. The Titans come into the matchup with a 6-1 home record, which is second in the conference only to UCSB's perfect 9-0 start to the year. One of the keys for the Gauchos will be limiting Fullerton's transition offense and momentum in general in order to keep the crowd out of the game. UCSB hasn't done a great job of imposing itself as a threat on the road so far, as the team is currently 4-5, but a solid win against a top two team in the conference would go a long way in making that happen. One reason why the Gauchos were successful in the last meeting between these teams was the offensive versatility of the starting lineup. While the two usual offensive stalwarts, sophomore guard Max Heidegger and graduate forward Leland King II, had a great game combining for 41 points, it was the double digit production from other players that pushed UCSB over the top. Graduate guard Marcus Jackson had a season-high 19 points, and both senior guard Gabe Vincent and senior forward Jalen Canty ended with double digits to round out the starting five. By diversifying their offensive attack, the Gauchos were able to spread out and overwhelm the Titans' defense, which is what led to an early 15-point lead and the eventual 19-point blowout. Fullerton will be looking to take advantage of the scoring ability of their bench to close the gaps between these two teams. In the last matchup between these teams, the Titans bench outscored the Santa Barbara bench 17-2, and ""î as far as conventional basketball knowledge says ""î key players perform better at home than they do on the road. While part of the discrepancy between bench scoring had to do with some garbage time scoring by Fullerton, the Gauchos have a real problem producing on offense when the starting five isn't in, as they have shown with their two blown 20-point leads. While these problems with offense for the bench won't be solved overnight, they just make it that much more important for the Gauchos' reserves to continue to play hard and smart on defense. Two players to keep an eye out for on the Titans are guards Kyle Allman, Jr. and Khalil Ahmad. The juniors make up one of the highest-scoring tandems in the Big West, with a combined 33.5 points per game. The Gauchos played good defense on them in the last game, holding them .5 points below their collective average; however, containing them a second time will be much harder, especially at Fullerton. Overall, this is a big game for UCSB in terms of standings. A win will push the Gauchos up to second place and in direct contention with first place Hawaii, who they play next week. Because of early-season miscues, there is a must-win mentality in this squad that trickles down from the high expectations set by Coach Pasternack and his staff. All the players have to do is get out there and execute, which they've done a good job of so far. UCSB faces off against CSUF at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 25 at Titan Gym in Fullerton, CA.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup, set to take place in Russia, has recently been all the talk around the world. After years of qualification matches and cheering on their international side, fans of the beautiful game are celebrating their nation's ticket to the biggest stage in world football.
Fortunately, the wait until the summer of 2018 won't be too uneventful thanks to the World Cup drawing event that recently took place at the start of December. Now, with the group stage set and tensions high, the country comparisons will start to occur as analysts will weigh each team's chances at advancing past the group stage. This leads me to my unbiased predictions of the drawing's results ""¶ especially since the United States didn't qualify. Group A: Russia, Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia The Hosts Draw a Favorable Batch For those not in the know concerning the World Cup's group draw, each team, excluding the host nation, which is always granted the first slot, starts off placed in a competitive pot that is shared with other teams of nearly similar FIFA men's rankings. So, for informational purposes, every group is ordered by skill level as listed.
The host nation of Russia is a part of the first four designated sides. Uruguay and Egypt are the Top 30 teams in Russia's way, while Saudi Arabia is ranked just below them. Historically speaking, host nations tend to perform well at their World Cups, even if they are undervalued on paper, as in Russia's case. Nevertheless, we see Uruguay and Russia going through unless Egypt has something to say about it. Group B: Portugal, Spain, Iran, Morocco Two Giants, Two Dreams Both Portugal and Spain have been considered Top 10 in world football for years now. However, if you're asking FIFA, they're even better. Coming in at No. 3 and No. 6 respectively, Portugal and Spain appear to be clear-cut favorites to stand at the top of their groups when all is said and done. Unless a pair of upset losses occur within this group stage, the Top-35 side Iran and closely following Morocco won't have much of a chance due to all the star power on the opposition. Nevertheless, the Portugal vs. Spain match should provide a must-watch competition for all fans alike. Group C: France, Peru, Denmark, Australia A Battle for Positioning At a quick glance, one may make the mistake to simply jump to the conclusion that France has this one in the bag. Think again. Ranked at No. 9 overall, France barely holds a lead in the standings when considering Peru is placed at 11th next to 12th place Denmark. Peru is hungry for a good group stage finish after not qualifying for the World Cup for 36 years, and Denmark is a source for quality talent amongst Europe's elite clubs. Sure, we'll cheer on the Australian underdogs, but it seems like France will have its work cut out when having to deal with a group that is capable of top-tier play. Group D: Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, Nigeria Messi is No Group Stage Guarantee Yes, you read that right: ""úMessi is no group stage guarantee.""ù Why would we word the headline as such? Well, this Argentina team has played fairly average whenever Messi is absent from the roster. Is this a lack of performance from a side full of star power, or are they just simply missing the best player in world football? Regardless of the correct answer, this group is still very much competitive considering its circumstances. Croatia is home to some of the best football-playing athletes, and Iceland is truly living a Cinderella story of success. And, oh yeah, the 51st ranked Nigeria just came off a 4-2 thrashing over the No. 4 overall Argentina. We'll still give it just barely to Argentina, followed by perhaps the most surprising of all the group stages' victors: Nigeria. A version of this story appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 25, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,X's and O's: Breaking Down the 2018 FIFA World Cup Groups (E-H),25-Jan-18,5:08 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-25/xs-and-os-breaking-down-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-groups-e-h/,"Kevin Chan / Daily Nexus Group E: Brazil, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Serbia A Solid Test for Brazil Arguably the most talented team in the whole competition, Brazilian stardom has managed to excel at even an international level. They claimed the top of the CONMEBOL qualification league fairly easily in South America, and now they'll be one of the favorites to take it all in Russia. That being said, Switzerland and Serbia are still both powerful European sides, although Costa Rica might jump ahead of them both, as they proved their side deserved global recognition following last year's World Cup. In the end, there will be several great matches to watch here, and by several we only mean all three of Brazil's games. Group F: Germany, Mexico, Sweden, South Korea The Champions Draw the Group of Death The ""úGroup of Death""ù is pretty self-explanatory as is, but for the sake of learning it is considered the most competitive and unpredictable group. Regardless, the German team has been the poster boy for elite football for several years now, especially after coming off winning the World Cup. As for Mexico and Sweden, it may very well come down to either of them as they'll try to secure the second spot in this group. Although, the last time we underestimated South Korea, they somehow made it to the World Cup semifinal""¶and then were beat by Germany. Group G: Belgium, England, Tunisia, Panama England Just Might Get the Job Done There's always a recurring meme that circulates around this time that pretty much revolves around the fact that England invented this sport, yet still sucks at it. However, after the group stage drawing, fans of England should rejoice. Tunisia and Panama aren't near the Top 16 rankings of both England and Belgium, so there might just be a chance for England. ""úA chance""ù being the key phrase here, since Tunisia or Panama might very well join Belgium in advancing out of the group stage, and we wouldn't even consider it an upset result.
We'd apologize for this banter toward England, but banter would mean the exchange of teasing remarks. However, since the U.S. didn't even qualify (yes, we're still mad) over the likes of No. 53 Panama, we'll just sit back and practice our cockney accents. Good luck to our friends from across the pond. Group H: Poland, Colombia, Senegal, Japan The Most Balanced of All Now that we've gotten the entertainment factor out in this article, it's time to return to a very balanced and wholesome drawn group analysis. This might very well be the most wide open group out of all the competitors, and it might very well be the only group in which the first pot selection doesn't advance. Japan is the lowest ranked here at 56th overall; however, Poland, Colombia and Senegal are all well within range of each other in the FIFA rankings. Therefore, don't be surprised when any of these teams top their group.
It's still way too early to accurately and efficiently predict who will succeed come this next FIFA World Cup. Still, we'll make the educated guess of having Brazil and Germany as the two favorites of the entire tourney. Stay tuned as more updates will come as the greatest stage in world football nears its arrival.
To recap, here are the results of the drawing once again as well as our early Top-2 picks in asterisks: Group A: *Russia, *Uruguay, Egypt, Saudi Arabia Group B: *Portugal, *Spain, Iran, Morocco Group C: *France, *Peru, Denmark, Australia Group D: *Argentina, Croatia, Iceland, *Nigeria Group E: *Brazil, Switzerland, *Costa Rica, Serbia Group F: *Germany, *Mexico, Sweden, South Korea Group G: *Belgium, *England, Tunisia, Panama Group H: Poland, *Colombia, *Senegal, Japan

sports,UCSB Remains on the Road For ITA Kick-Off Classic,26-Jan-18,6:29 PM,['Andrew Bishop'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-26/ucsb-remains-on-the-road-for-ita-kick-off-classic/,"This Saturday, the 1-1 UCSB women's tennis team will travel to Auburn, Ala., to compete against the University of Miami, which currently stands at 17th in the nation, in the first round of the 2018 ITA Kick-off Weekend tournament.  The Gauchos will face off against the Hurricanes after splitting their season opening matches against two challenging opponents, No. 16 UCLA and unranked USC. After suffering a 4-2 loss on Friday to UCLA, the Gauchos bounced back in a big way on Saturday, with a decisive 6-1 victory against USC. Saturday's victory was the Gauchos' first against the Trojans since 1994. The Gauchos' opening weekend was dominated by the outstanding play of junior Stephanie Yamada, whose impressive performances earned her a Big West Women's Tennis Athlete of the Week award. Yamada lit up her opponents in both singles and doubles, putting her at 4-0 on the season. Natalia Da Silveira returns a a serve with a forehand. Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus Yamada will hope to continue her win streak this weekend, in what will be the Hurricanes' first match of the season after a tough 2016-17 campaign that resulted in a 13-12 record. This season, the Hurricanes are looking to make a run at an NCAA title with their two ITA ranked singles players, No. 36 sophomore Estela Perez-Somarriba and No. 41 senior Sinead Lohan.  Both Lohan and Perez-Somarriba have received numerous ACC honors throughout their careers at the University of Miami, and will likely put up a fight against the Gauchos in singles play. While the Hurricanes' ranked players pose a significant threat, the Gauchos have already proven that they can handle ranked opponents this season in their defeat of USC's pair of ranked singles players, No. 35 senior Gabby Smith and No. 85 senior Madison Westby. The Gauchos also routed the Trojan's No. 46 duo of junior Rianna Valdes and sophomore Angela Kulikov in doubles play. If the Gauchos can secure more victories against ranked opponents early in the season, their case for appearances in the ITA rankings will only grow stronger.  Saturday's matchup will also give the Gauchos a chance to showcase their talented freshmen, Elizaveta Volodko and Lise Sentenac, who started their UCSB careers in a relatively turbulent fashion.  Sentenac fell short in her first singles match against UCLA's junior Gabby Andrews, and Volodko's first singles match against UCLA's No. 46 Abi Altick was ruled ""úunfinished""ù by the referee.  The pair also fell short in both of their respective doubles matches during opening weekend, and only Volodko would exit the weekend with a victory in her singles match against USC's junior Valdes.  The Gauchos will look to give Volodko and Sentenac more exposure against the Hurricanes, and hopefully make them top competitors in the Big West. Depending on the outcome of their match against Miami, UCSB will go head-to-head with either No. 13 Auburn University or Tulane University the day after. Auburn could give the Gauchos another shot at a ranked victory, if the Gauchos wind up facing them in the final round of the tournament.  The Tigers boast a pair of ranked singles players with No. 53 freshman Jaeda Daniel and No. 77 sophomore Taylor Russo, and a No. 31 ranked duo of Russo and senior Alizee Michaud.  The Tigers are 3-0 on the season, and have yet to lose a single game, winning each of their three matchups with scores of 4-0. Tulane does not dominate the ITA rankings in the same way that Auburn does, but the Green Wave has proven to be a formidable opponent so far this season with a record of 2-0. Like the Tigers, the Green Wave has yet to give up a single game to its opponents, defeating each of them with scores of 4-0. Regardless of who they face following their matchup against the Hurricanes, it looks as though the Gauchos are in for a challenging weekend down south. The match against the University of Miami is scheduled to be played on Saturday, Jan. 27, at 11 a.m. The match against Auburn or Tulane is scheduled for Sunday, Jan. 28, and the time of play is has yet to be determined.

sports,Gauchos Fall to No. 7 Wolves,27-Jan-18,11:30 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-27/gauchos-fall-to-no-7-wolves/,"Connor Drake sneds a float serve over the net. Jenny Luo/Daily Nexus The No. 15 UCSB men's volleyball team continued its road journey with a Thursday matchup against No. 7 Loyola University Chicago. As expected, the matchup was intense as the first two sets of the match were decided by two points. Unfortunately for UCSB, an early lack of being able to close out sets while the Wolves worked their way back into the match ultimately led to the Gauchos 3-1 loss on the night. Following the defeat, the Gauchos now stand at 3-2 as the early part of their regular season continues. Upon entering Thursday's match, anticipation of UCSB junior outside hitter Corey Chavers emerged as he was coming off his first career Big West Player of the Week honor following a career-high 24 kills in a win over No. 12 Pepperdine. Santa Barbara's All-American sophomore middle blocker, Keenan Sanders, finally made his season debut after missing the team's first four matches of the season due to injury. The first set featured an intense 25-23 victory in favor of the Loyola home side. At first, the Gauchos' attack seemed to be firing on all cylinders. Although, it wasn't until the final half of play that Gaucho mistakes started allowing the point gap to close in. Then soon after, UCSB allowed their 23-20 lead to falter as the Loyola Wolves clinched an upset set victory following their impressive come back. The second set featured an even closer affair as an almost countless number of lead changes were experienced. A total of 16 different tie games were observed and this set seemed like it could have gone either way. Unfortunately, it once again was claimed by the Loyola home side following three consecutive serving errors from the visiting Gauchos. In order to stay in the game, UCSB needed to extend the match by winning this following set. With a staggering hitting percentage difference of UCSB's .265 to Loyola's .086, the Gauchos reignited their potent attacking force. The set eventually resulted in a 25-18 score favoring UCSB. In order to force a fifth set, the Gauchos would have needed to take this next set as well. However, a dominant 8 point streak by the host around the halfway mark of the set gave Loyola the advantage they needed in order to put this meet to bed. With the Gauchos hitting a game low percentage of .050, the final set's score tallying in at 25-17, Loyola had done it and sent the Gauchos home with only their 2nd loss of the regular season. Team leaders for this match once again included Chavers, who totaled 18 kills for UCSB. Combined, the team's middle blockers of Sanders and red shirt sophomore Brandon Hopper also put up another 18 kills. Sophomore setter Randy DeWeese also got the job done once more with 39 assists. The Gauchos will look to return to their winning ways this Saturday, Jan. 27, as they head away from home to face the Lewis University Flyers at noon.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's tennis started the season strong over the weekend at the ITA kick-off championship classic, blanking SMU 4-0 Friday before losing a hard-fought match against 5th ranked USC on Saturday, 6-1. The Gauchos came storming out of the gate against the Mustangs on Friday, easily clinching the doubles point to start the match. Juniors Nicolas Moreno De Alboron and Anders Holm, the No.44 ranked doubles duo in the country, defeated SMU's top doubles pair, Tomas Vaise and Jan-Simon Vrbsky, 6-3.  Santa Barbara then clinched the point by having senior Simon Freund and redshirt freshman Joseph Rotherman win their set, 7-5, after clinching the tiebreaker point. With the momentum on their side, the Gauchos slammed the door on SMU in singles play, aided in large part by the play of the newcomers to the team.  Holm dominated his match, winning 6-2,6-0, but UCSB clinched the match victory when sophomore transfer Joseph Guillin and Freshman Victor Krustev won their matches.  Guillin won the first set 6-2, and clinched the victory when his opponent retired because of injury. Krustev, who just joined the team a handful of weeks ago, won his match in straight sets, 6-2,6-2. ""úOur ability to ""òput the hammer down' after taking leads in the singles matches was the most satisfying aspect of the win over SMU,""ù Head Coach Marty Davis said. ""úWe were ruthlessly efficient in the second sets of those matches.""ù While the rest of the matches were suspended after Krustev's victory, fellow newcomer Hironori Koyanagi put together a strong match in his Gaucho debut. Koyanagi won his first set 6-2, and was dominating the second set 5-1 when the match got called. After their dominant victory over SMU, who dropped to 1-4 on the season, UCSB awaited to see who their opponent would be in their match Saturday. That wait that didn't last for long, however, †as perennial powerhouse USC defeated Indiana, 6-1. The Gauchos knew they would have their work cut out for them in their second match of the season. Because the tournament was held at USC, they would be forced to play a de-facto road game against one of the top teams in the nation. UCSB started off slow in the fight for the doubles point, as Holm and Moreno De Alboran dropped their match against No. 6 ranked doubles player Brandon Holt and Riley Smith. Despite a hard-fought match on court two, Freund and Rotherman dropped their match, 6-4, giving the doubles point to the Trojans. ""úWe need to eliminate mental errors in doubles,""ù Davis said. ""úWe also need to work on second serve strength, accuracy, and consistency.""ù Despite the loss of the doubles point, the duo of Krustev and Guillen displayed a myriad of potential; when the match was called, they were tied 5-5. In fact, Krustev continued to impress, earning the only point in the match for the Gauchos by winning his singles match in two sets, 6-3, 7-6. Another standout performance came from Moreno de Alboron; despite his loss, he was able to win the second set against Holt, who is ranked No.11 in the nation for singles. ""úWe showed traditional Gaucho grit and toughness [today],""ù Davis said. ""úNic dove for balls on concrete ""¶ that hurts ""¶ and he did it a few times. †Joe Guillin played with a injured finger from a tumble yesterday and all the guys fought their butts off. †I was super pleased with the effort and fight the guys showed.""ù But despite this effort, the Trojans ultimately overmatched the Gauchos, and were able to win the match 6-1. UCSB now sits at 1-1 after splitting their games in the ITA kick-off championship classic, and head back to Santa Barbara for their first home match of the season against San Diego State this Friday.

Throughout the tournament the Gauchos were impressive, winning big early on and finishing with a strong performance despite losing a close game to Indiana. Play began against the University of Toronto Varsity Blues on Friday where the Gauchos exploded on offense and completely shut down Toronto on defense, winning the game 23-0. Once again it was Junior Kate Pipkin who provided an offensive surge with three goals and two assists. It almost seemed as if the entire team joined Pipkin in the scoring bonanza, finishing the game with nine different Gauchos who were able to find the back of the net. Defensively, the team was clearly dominant and earned their second shutout of the season. The team's strong performance was a positive sign headed into their doubleheader the following day. Saturday's first game was against the Mckendree Bearcats where the Gauchos once again played extraordinary, increasing their win streak to three after beating McKendree 15-2. Junior Sarah Kreiser and sophomore Sarah Snyder each scored four goals, while defensively it was Becca Buck who only allowed two goals out of the Bearcats' 16 shots. After getting through their first two matches with relative ease, it was the #12 Hoosiers of Indiana who made nothing easy in their match that ended 7-6 in favor of Indiana. Sarah Snyder was once again the team's leading scorer but only managed two goals in a game where the defense was the focal point. At the end of the 2nd period, the Gauchos lead Indiana 6-5, but the Hoosiers were able to shut out their opponent while simultaneously scoring the go-ahead goal in the 3rd minute. The 7-6 loss for the Gauchos brought their three-game winning streak to an end and left their record at 2-1 before Sunday. The last day of the tournament was yet another doubleheader day for UCSB against No. 25 Iona and No. 19 Harvard. UCSB came back in their game against Iona, winning 13-2. Sophomore attacker Shannon Moran was the leading scorer for UCSB with three goals. Goalkeepers Becca Buck and Kenzi Snyder each allowed one goal out of Iona's 26 shots. The final game against Harvard ended in another close one, an 8-5 win for UCSB. The scoring came from four Gauchos with three scoring 2+ goals and the other scoring one goal. UCSB was able to stay ahead of the Crimson despite the team outscoring UCSB 2-1 in the final quarter. The team's impressive performance over the course of the tournament increased the team's overall record to 8-3. The offensive leaders for the team have been excellent and the whole team has shown to be capable of joining in on the scoring when the team can get rolling. The defense for UCSB has also shown a capability to standout, three out of the team's five games ended with the opponent scoring 2 or fewer goals. Becca Buck and Kenzi Snyder's keeping over recent play has been astounding, often returning sheets with a low amount of goals allowed and a high save percentage. The team will now face a long break from play before being thrown back into another tournament in San Diego UCSB will play next on February 10th in their first game of the Triton Invitational.

This loss puts Santa Barbara at 4-3 in conference play, 7-12 overall and it is now all tied up with Cal State Northridge in the Big West, with both teams currently sitting at the fourth seed. The victory leaves the Aggies at a commanding†position atop the Big West thus far this season with a 17-3 overall mark and a 7-0 in conference play. The game was what seemed like an even matchup, both teams having a pretty even exchange of buckets in the first through third quarters. With both teams keeping on pace with each other, the intensity was rising, but both teams were up for the challenge. The visiting Santa Barbara team seemed confident and was hoping to outlast the Aggies this time, unlike in their former matchup where they dropped the game 68-61. Looking back to when the Gauchos hosted UC Davis on January 18, the Gauchos fell to their opponents due to an explosive fourth period by the home team. History seemed to repeat itself, as that was again the same story. The third quarter was heated, with both teams going blow for blow. In a quarter that was a fast-paced battle consisting of back-and-forth basketball, neither team led by more than four points. Looking at the scoreboard, it was 45-44 after the third ""ì UCSB clinging on to their one-point advantage going into the last quarter of regulation. The visitors opened their last quarter with a subpar performance, scoring just three points over the first seven minutes. During that same time, UC Davis outscored their opponents 15-3. The Gauchos attempted to stomp their way back into the game to get the win, but ultimately their attempt was futile. The Aggies outscored UCSB 25-18 in the last quarter of regulation, solidifying their second win against Santa Barbara in just a few days. UCSB Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a monster game, leading all scorers with 25 points ""ì equaling her career-high. Bates was on fire from long range, draining seven of twelve from downtown. The only other players scoring double digits for the visiting Gauchos were redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman who scored 13 points, and senior guard Makala Roper who notched 12 points of her own. Edelman had her fifth double-double of the season, seasoning 10 rebounds to go along with her 13 points. And Roper's 12 points were scored as she came off the bench, and she impressively went four of five from beyond the arc. The Gauchos who scored in double digits were seemingly the only gleaming spot for the visiting team, as the rest of the team went only went 4 for 27 from the field. The Aggies had four of their starters contribute double digits in the matchup, with redshirt junior forward Morgan Bertsch leading her team, scoring 16 points. Senior combo guard/forward Dani Nafekh came through in the clutch and made her presence known for the home team in the fourth quarter, splashing eight of her ten points in the final quarter. Nafekh drained two three-pointers in a crucial time of the game and gave the Aggies a five-point lead, getting them out of their late two-point deficit.

Coming off a decisive victory over USC last weekend, the 2-2 Gauchos faced off against Miami in the first round of the tournament, and were quickly defeated 4-0, leaving one doubles game and three singles games unfinished. Miami dominated throughout the afternoon, relying on its nationally recognized players, No. 36 sophomore Estela Perez-Somarriba and No. 41 senior Sinead Lohan, to bring home victories in both singles and doubles play. The pair combined for three wins against the Gauchos, securing two doubles victories, and one singles victory. Nexus File Photo Senior Natalie Da Silveira and Lohan traded blows during their singles match, with Da Silveira claiming an early set victory and then relinquishing the second set to Lohan. The game would ultimately go unfinished due to a Hurricane match victory. Perez-Somarriba's match against UCSB senior Palina Duvabets was not so close. Duvabets struggled against the Hurricanes' talented No. 1, losing both sets 6-1. While the match ended in a shutout, the Gauchos put up more of a fight than the final score might have indicated. Junior Stephanie Yamada, came the closest to securing a Gaucho victory, tying the Hurricanes' sophomore Dominika Paterova and junior Daniella Roldan 5-5 in an unfinished doubles game, alongside her teammate, senior Amanda Atanasson. Yamada, who was named Big West Women's Tennis Athlete of the Week last week, was equally competitive in the first set of her singles match against the Hurricane's freshman Ulyana Shirokova. Despite a close first set, Yamada fell short in both sets against Shirokova, who handed Yamada her first official loss of the season, putting her at 5-1. Despite glimpses of balance between the two teams, the Hurricanes defeated the Gauchos handily and advanced to the final round of the tournament to face No. 16 Auburn University. The Hurricanes were subsequently defeated by the Tigers 2-4, leaving Miami 1-1 on the season and Auburn with an undefeated 5-0 record. Following their shutout on Saturday, the Gauchos bounced back against Tulane University on Sunday in the consolation round of the ITA Kick-off tournament. The Gauchos routed the Green Wave without much trouble, finishing the match with a score of 4-0. The Gauchos' surge was led by their star seniors, Duvabets and Da Silveira, who combined for three wins and no losses against Tulane. The pair secured the first doubles victory of the day for their team, and Duvabets appeared to be unstoppable in her singles match against senior Sade Atkinson, winning both sets 6-1. After a rocky start against their first three opponents, UCSB freshmen Elizaveta Volodko and Lise Sentenac finally found their groove on Sunday against the Green Wave. Volodko earned her second singles win of the season against junior Elena Muller, and Sentenac was poised to win her first singles game of the season against freshman Daniela La Fuente until the game was ruled unfinished due to a match victory for the Gauchos. The pair also came close to securing their first doubles victory of the season, but it too was ruled unfinished after the Gauchos secured the doubles point. By routing the Green Wave in the consolation round, the Gauchos secured third place in the tournament behind two very talented and highly ranked teams. Both Tulane and UCSB finished the weekend with season records of 2-2. The unranked Gauchos have managed to compile an impressive season record considering the high concentration of ranked opponents that they have faced so far. Next weekend is not shaping up to be any easier, as the Gauchos will travel to Malibu on Friday to face No. 6 Pepperdine University, and then return home for a doubleheader on Saturday against USF and Kansas State. While the Gauchos may not fill out the win column early in the season, their rigorous schedule will certainly leave them well prepared to face rivals in the Big West. UCSB's next match will be Friday, February 2nd at Pepperdine.

Santa Barbara lost by the following results: 25-23, 21-25, 19-25, and 23-25. Ranked No. 10 in the nation, Lewis University was coming off a four-game win streak, all of which occurred at home. Meanwhile, Saturday resulted in the Gauchos second-straight loss of their five-game road trip. In this matchup, the Gauchos were held to a .191 hitting percentage as compared to Lewis University's .283. In terms of game leaders, All American sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders once again put up an outstanding performance as he led all players with 24 kills on the night. Compared to the Flyers' leading outside hitter, sophomore Ryan Coenen's total of 15 kills, it was a career high day for Sanders as his previous record was 14 kills in a single match. The first set had tensions high right away as both teams got off to booming starts. The match went back and forth as several lead changes turned into an eventual multi point lead for the Gauchos. Ultimately, it came down to Sanders' kill production count of nine in just the first set and clutch ace serves that would go on to set up UCSB's first set victory by a score of 25-23. Sanders averaged a second-highest hitting percentage for his side at .302, whilst redshirt junior middle blocker Connor Drake had a team leading .375. The host side then hit back hard as the Flyers opened the second set with a dominant 8-2 run. With help in the scoring category by Coenen's .286 hitting percentage as well as redshirt junior opposite Mitch Perinar's second most kill count of 12 total on .417 hitting, it proved enough for Lewis University to clinch the second set and tie the meet's score count at 1-1. As the Gauchos wanted to reclaim the lead, they just never found themselves back in their first set form as they allowed another scoring drought to take place early on; which resulted in Lewis University's third set victory.

Nexus File Photo Similar to the Gauchos and their ending to the Aggies, CSUN lost their most recent game to UC Irvine 56-47, due to a strong fourth quarter from their opponents. Both UCSB and Cal State Northridge previously faced off against each other earlier in the month, and Santa Barbara squeaked away with the one-point win on the road, to win the game 74-73. The game was made up of extreme intensity, both teams going bucket-for-bucket and bringing the heat. The game ended up being tied at the end of each quarter until UCSB edged out their opponents by one point in the final period of regulation. In considering the last 5 meetings between these two teams, the Gauchos have a slight advantage ""ì having to beat the Matadors 3 out of the last 5 games. In order to come out on top, Santa Barbara will have to have another strong offensive game. And if they want to win convincingly, they must be sure to keep their opponents' firepower at bay, otherwise, it's going to be another tough one down the stretch. Players for the Gauchos to look out for, are the two leading scorers for the Matadors ""ì junior center Channon Fluker and junior forward Tessa Boagni, who have both been on an explosive tangent this season. Averaging 20.9 and 11.9 points per game respectively, Fluker and Boagni are forced to be reckoned with on the court, as their potent offense has the potential to put extreme pressure on the defensive approach of Santa Barbara. Last time these opponents faced off, they both hovered around 40% shooting for the game, but it will be crucial for one team to edge out the other in the offensive tug-of-war, just as UCSB previously did on the road in the fourth quarter, to solidify the win against the home team Matadors. Both teams had great rebounding in their previous meeting, with Cal State Northridge having the very slight advantage in that category. One category the Matadors dominated their opponents in during the last meeting, pointed in the paint. During the last game, Cal State Northridge won the high percentage shot battle, by having an impressive 48 points scored in the paint, to Santa Barbara's less than half 22 points in the same category. Undoubtedly both teams will need to put more concentration into their fourth-quarter play, as that was the detriment of both teams in their most recent losses to their opponents. Producing points in clutch time will be key if both teams score as consistently against each other as they did in the past. Freshman guard Sarah Bates had a spectacular game last time UCSB went toe-to-toe with Cal State Northridge, contributing a double-double consisting of 23 points and 5 assists. A repeat effort from the volatile guard would increase the chances of Santa Barbara bouncing back and winning their next game. Bench play will be another factor to look out for, as UCSB will need its reserves to show up and show out if they want to gain separation throughout regulation. Santa Barbara is slated to play against Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, January 31, at home in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.

sports,Men's Golf Takes Second Place at Waves Challenge,31-Jan-18,5:32 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-01-31/mens-golf-takes-2nd-place-finish-at-waves-challenge/,"2015 Big West Freshman of the Year, Zach Smith stares down his shot. Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus Thanks to a great performance from junior Brandon Bauman, the UCSB men's golf team rallied to finish in second place at the Waves Challenge hosted at the Saticoy Country Club this past weekend. ""úI was very happy to have finished second place,""ù Head Coach Steve Lass said. ""úWe had some wonderful individual performances, especially on the final day, and we had a couple top-10 finishes so that was good.""ù For Santa Barbara, this marks its second, second-place finish of the season and is a sign of good things to come with the spring season just starting. The Gauchos have competed in four total tournaments so far this season. UCSB finished with a final score of 914, 37 strokes behind Pepperdine and just one point ahead of third place Boise State. Pepperdine's 37-shot win is the new program record for margin of victory. Bauman finished tied for fourth in the individual after finishing 7-over par 223 and carding an even 72 in the days' final events to move up four spots. Most of the field finished above par for the tournament minus Pepperdine's junior golfer Sahith Theegala who carded 11-under par 205. Theegala's 16-shot win is the new school record for margin of victory. Tied for fourth with Bauman was CSUN's senior Felix Mory who won last years individual at the Big West Championships. As a whole, Cal State Northridge finished the worst of the seven competing Big West teams finishing in 13th out of 15 place. ""úFelix is a really outstanding player and Brandon is too so it was great to see them play well,""ù Lass said. ""úIt was nice to beat all of the Big West teams here and have them worry about us here during the spring season. I want out guys to have the confidence to know we are a bit better than these good teams.""ù Junior Nick Swanson also had a great final day carding 4-under par 68, the second-best mark of the day, to help him finish tied for eighth at the Challenge. Swanson also had the second most birdies of anyone at the tournament with 11. The rest of the team struggled including November's Big West Golfer of the Month, Matthew Moomjian who would finish tied for 45th carding 25 over par for the tournament. ""úIt is now my job to figure out to make sure Matt does not lose confidence,""ù Lass said. ""úAlthough Matt has accomplished some pretty good things in college golf thus far, he is still just a sophomore without much experience. As he matures he will continue getting better.""ù Freshman Kyle Maspat tied for 32nd with 20-over par while sophomore Brandon Bueno was 66th shooting 33-over par. On the bright side for Bueno, he earned a hole-in-one on the 10th hole in his first collegiate start. Overall, the Gauchos certainly are proud of a second-place finish, however, it is clear some more work needs to be done. Despite the difficulty of the course, carding 50-over par is not something UCSB wants to become a habit. On the plus side, Bauman and Swanson are continuing to improve off what was a†great year for them in 2017, now the Gauchos need to solidify the other three slots. ""úThe course was very difficult†to play just because†of the conditions and how windy it was,""ù Lass said. ""úSo I understand shooting a high round but that does concern me and going forward we want to have all five guys playing really well and not just relying on a few.""ù By this point last season, Santa Barbara had already earned both a first and second place finish so the Gauchos aren't far off. That being said, this year UCSB is the team with the target on their backs following their Big West Championship finish last season. ""úIt's always great to win and have some success,""ù Lass said. ""úAnd now at this point, I just want to find out top five players for the rest of year and hopefully things will pan out come Big West Tournament.""ù The Gauchos will be back in action at the John A. Burns Intercollegiate in Lihue, Kauai, Hawai'i taking place Feb. 15-17.

sports,A Trip Down Memory Lane: Our Favorite Super Bowls,1-Feb-18,5:09 AM,"['Kendra Jackson', 'Andrew Bishop', 'Spencer Ault']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/a-trip-down-memory-lane-our-favorite-super-bowls/,"What's the Catch? by Kendra Jackson It was Super Bowl LI. Everyone was speechless. The Patriots were getting smoked by the Atlanta Falcons.
Tom Brady had been rushed, sacked and picked off all within the span of the first half, and it seemed as though Super Bowl victory No. 5 was just about out of reach for the New England Patriots.
The score was 28-3 late in the third quarter, and nobody expected a blowout this bad.
Coming back from such a big deficit would have been an impossible feat for most teams and for most quarterbacks ""¶ but not for Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.
New England had scored 17 unanswered points, and it was officially a ball game.
That's when it happened. One of the most amazing moments in Super Bowl history.
The Patriots were 64 yards from the end zone and were facing an 8-point deficit.
Just 2:28 was left in regulation, and the offense for New England was set. Shot gun formation ""ì Brady set and ready to throw a bullet.
Julian Edelman was the intended receiver, but he was surrounded by three Falcons.
Robert Alford, the Falcons corner who picked off Brady in the first half, made what would have been one of the biggest ball deflections in his entire career. He hit the football as it was spiraling in the air, and it looked as if he had ruined the hopes of New England, all with a bat of the ball.
But Alford didn't pick the ball this time, he just deflected it in the air; the ball was still in play and fair game to be caught.
Regardless of all the traffic, Edelman managed to make one of the most prodigious catches in Super Bowl history.
Edelman was able to grab the batted ball, put his hand under it, secure it and prevent it from touching the ground.
In that very moment, I knew, and everyone watching knew, that the Patriots were going to come back and win this game.
That catch set up the tying touchdown that eventually led to the first overtime period in Super Bowl history, and another Lombardi Trophy for New England.
That 23-yard pass across the middle was the fairytale to end what was a rollercoaster season for the Patriots. From the Deflategate scandal to Brady's resulting suspension, New England wanted this one bad ""ì and that catch made sure it happened.
In the words of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, this win was ""úunequivocally the sweetest.""ù Party Like It's 1985 by Andrew Bishop To football fans of the 21st century, the idea of the Chicago Bears blowing out the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl seems almost unheard of. However, at the end of the 1985 season in Super Bowl XX, the Monsters of the Midway bullied the Patriots to a 46-10 victory.
Every Chicago Bears fan who was alive in 1985 remembers the Bears' triumphant quest for the Lombardi Trophy, and even those like myself who were born after their victory grew up hearing tales of the famed team that won the Bears their first and only Super Bowl.
Scholars of the game regard the '85 Bears as being one of the greatest teams in the history of the NFL. Much like the Patriots of today, everyone was betting on the Bears to win in '85. Led by legendary head coach Mike Ditka, the Bears' defense terrorized opposing teams in ways nobody had ever seen before, and their offense was carried almost singlehandedly by the immortal Walter Payton, the greatest professional running back of all time.
Throughout the season, the Bears dominated on the field, going 15-1 and leading the league on defense, and off the field, where Bears players recorded a Grammy-nominated hit single that raised over $300,000 for Chicago charities. Unlike the Patriots, who are viewed as the proverbial ""úbad guys""ù of the NFL, the '85 Bears were lovable and dominant, and America couldn't get enough of them.
There were many great moments throughout the Bears' season, Grammy nomination included, but the most memorable moment of all came in the third quarter of Super Bowl XX. Following a fumble recovery by Bears linebacker Wilber Marshall, the Bears managed to march down to the Patriots 1-yard line, where they employed their secret weapon: William Perry, a 6'2""ù, 350-pound defensive tackle-turned running back.
Perry, better known by his endearing nickname ""úThe Fridge,""ù was one of the largest players to ever set foot on a professional football field, and Coach Ditka had the brilliant idea to give this monstrous human being the ball on the goal line. Outweighing nearly every opposing defender by over 100 pounds, the Fridge took the handoff and plowed through the line like a bowling ball, stumbling into the end zone for a touchdown.
The nation erupted in collective laughter as the athletic giant ran over his opposition and capped his score off with a ball spike that puts Rob Gronkowski's to shame. Despite lasting no more than a few seconds, that goal line play is remembered by football fans throughout the nation for all of eternity.
The '85 Bears are worshipped by fans throughout the nation, and reruns of the Patriots' demolition in Super Bowl XX still play in American households to this day. It was an undeniably memorable season, which was capped off in spectacular fashion with a touchdown scored by a man the size of a refrigerator. PATS INT SAVES THE DAY by Spencer Ault It's a little difficult for me to pick just one Super Bowl moment in particular as my favorite.
I'm a Patriots fan, see, which means that not only am I incredibly obnoxious, but I also have a lot of good moments to choose from.
The Adam Vinatieri field goals are pretty good, if a little fuzzy, and the whole fourth quarter against the Falcons was pretty amazing.
The top spot, however, is reserved for the Malcolm Butler interception to win Super Bowl XLIX.
I was a junior in high school, only just starting to worry about getting into college.
I was actually enrolled in an SAT prep class that met on Sunday nights, even on Sunday nights that happened to be the Super Bowl.
I started the game off at a friend's house, but I went back home to be with my mostly Patriot-supporting family after a tough third quarter put New England behind 24-14.
My friends all hated the Patriots, rightfully so, and I wanted to be in a friendlier environment.
I could barely remember the Patriots' three Super Bowl wins but I could definitely remember the two losses, and I wasn't looking forward to a repeat of that feeling.
As the Seahawks drove into Patriot territory late in the game, however, it looked as though that was what I was in for.
The insane Jermaine Kearse catch, where he managed to catch a deflected pass by kicking it to himself while lying flat on his back, just reinforced my sense of doom.
The Seahawks inched closer to the end zone, and I started resigning myself to a depressing SAT class.
Then Malcolm Butler undercut Kearse's slant at the goal line and intercepted the ball with 20 seconds left in the game.
I went nuts, running around the house while my dad just stood there in disbelief.
The feeling just got better as the Patriots ran down the clock and my family continued to celebrate. Then I immediately got in my car and drove to my class, blasting music and singing the whole way.
It was the first Super Bowl win I was really conscious for, and it was amazing.
Being at home made it even more special, pushing it over the top in my memory banks.
If all goes right, I'll have another good memory after Sunday, but it's hard to see anything topping that interception. A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Feb. 1, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Encounter Trouble Scoring Against CSUN,1-Feb-18,8:52 PM,['Kendra Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/gauchos-encounter-trouble-scoring-against-csun/,"Drea Toler dribbles the ball around an opponent, fighting to keep possession. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's basketball team (7-13, 4-4) faced off against Cal State Northridge (12-10, 5-3) at the Thunderdome on Wednesday, Jan. 31 after recently playing the Matadors on their home court earlier in January where they picked up the win. The Gauchos failed to get the win against their opponents this time and dropped the game to CSUN ""ì the final score being 48-30. Prior to the start of the game, the home team was tied with their opposition in the Big West standings, both teams even as the fourth seed. This loss puts Santa Barbara at 4-4 in the Big West, with Cal State Northridge sitting at 5-3 in conference play. UCSB has now dropped to the 5th seed in the Big West, being edged out by their opponents ""ì the Matadors are now the lone fourth seed in the conference. The Gauchos couldn't seem to buy a bucket, as they only shot a subpar 20.3 percent from the field. CSUN was only slightly above their opponents, shooting at 27.8 percent on the night. The game started off looking promising, as redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman notched the first 4 points in the game, sinking in two baskets. However, those would be the last points the Gauchos would score for the remainder of that quarter. Regardless of their anemic offense, the game didn't look like it would run away from the home team, as the visitors only managed to put up 9 points on the board in the first period. The second quarter showed a bright spot for the Gauchos. They went on much needed 7-0 run sparked by sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez ""ì Santa Barbara was trailing 14-4 prior to the offensive explosion. After the 2 points by Hernandez, freshman combo guard/forward Nina Radford splashed a 3-pointer and senior guard Makala Roper swished in a layup. The run narrowed the deficit gap, the home team then only down by 3. The rest of the game was more of the same for UCSB, as their offensive struggles continued. The score was 22-13 at the half, the visiting Matadors holding the lead. The defense for the Gauchos was thriving, getting stop after stop, and making it extremely difficult for their opponents to get any offensive flow going. Despite the superb defense, though, it was all for naught. Santa Barbara could not manage to get themselves into any offensive rhythm of some sort. Cal State Northridge was held to just 26 points after the half, showcasing UCSB's stellar defense. However, the home team was trailing at the half and could not manage to pick up the pace and nix the deficit they were buried in, as they only were able to put up 17 points in the second half of the game. The road team ended the night on 15-for-54 shooting, while Santa Barbara had a 13-for-64 shooting night. Both teams were poor offensively, but they both also brought elite defenses to the game as well. The turnovers for both teams were less than ideal, CSUN having 15 and the home team giving away 13. Santa Barbara's bench outplayed their opponents, once again. UCSB's bench contributed 16 points, compared to the Matador's bench that only added 11. The leading scorer for the Gauchos was redshirt sophomore Tal Sahar, who scored 5 for the home team. Junior center Channon Fluker gave her team a boost with 15 points and was the leading scorer for CSUN. Santa Barbara looks to bounce back from this loss as they look ahead to go against Hawaii on Saturday, February 3 at 2pm at home once again in the Thunderdome.

sports,Protect the Dome: Gauchos Host Hawaii Aiming to Seize Control of Big West,1-Feb-18,5:16 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/protect-the-dome-gauchos-host-hawaii-aiming-to-seize-control-of-big-west/,"The UCSB men's basketball team is looking at one of its biggest tests so far this conference season as it gets set to take on Hawaii. The Rainbow Warriors just recently lost their first place position in the Big West and have now dropped to third with a 4-2 conference record. UCSB continues its ascent of the standings where it currently sits tied for first place at 5-2 with UC Davis. Hawaii comes into the matchup with one of the best overall records in the conference, at 13-6 they're second only to UCSB's incredible 16-5 start to the season, and they're one of two teams in the Big West that can say they have beaten these Gauchos this year.  The Rainbow Warriors were able to come away with a 77-76 victory last time these two teams played in Honolulu, and one of the big differences in the game was the contrast in bench production for both of these teams. In the matchup between these two teams two weeks ago, the Gaucho bench was outscored 16-6 by Hawaii. This season UCSB's starters have scored 1,406 out of 1,623 total points, which has led to success so far but can lead to some stagnation on offense when players like Max Heidegger or Leland King II need to rest. Max Heidegger reaches past the defense toward the hoop. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Heidegger's 21 points per game leads the conference in scoring while King II's 15.5 points per game are second on the team. This was evident last time these teams played, as it was an uphill battle the whole game for UCSB. Each run the Gauchos made with their best weapons on the court was undone when they went to the bench, and ultimately they weren't able to make a full comeback.  One of the keys for Coach Pasternack going into Thursday night and, for the rest of the season, will be getting more from his bench and finding a way to make sure that the stars aren't too worn down going into the postseason. Another key for UCSB will be staying perfect at home this year, which they have managed to do for a while sporting a 9-0 record at the Thunderdome so far.  The Gauchos are one win away from matching their best ever home start which was 10-0 done by the 1989-90 squad, which is a complete turnaround from their 5-8 home record last year.  Coach Pasternack talked about the importance of building a strong home base in the beginning of the season, and the team's great performances so far have given the UCSB community a lot to be excited about.  Attendance has been great as of late, and if the Gauchos can continue their dominance we may be seeing an even bigger cultural shift on campus in terms of regaining pride in SB as a basketball school. A couple players to watch for on Hawaii are redshirt freshman guard Drew Buggs and senior forward Mike Thomas. Buggs is a quick yet high IQ guard that leads the Rainbow Warriors in both assists (3.8 per game) and steals (1.6).  While he only scored nine points last time these teams met, he is a big part of the offensive gameplan for Hawaii, so it will be important for the Gauchos to limit him as a distributor.  Thomas is a much more straightforward down-low player, yet has shown how efficient he can be a scorer. He scores more per game than any other player on Hawaii averaging 11.3 points per contest, yet doesn't take the most shots.  His battle with Jalen Canty and Leland King down on the boards will be pivotal to how much success the Rainbow Warriors have on offense, and he will also have to play a huge role in producing on the offensive end for Hawaii as well. The Gauchos have a lot riding on this game, and they're aware that a chance to move up to first in the Big West and tie the best home start to the season ever doesn't come around too often.  The Rainbow Warriors know that they can compete with UCSB, and won't go down easy, but it's going to be up to the Gauchos to use their talent and the home crowd to come out with a win. Santa Barbara takes on Hawaii at 7 p.m. on Thursday, February 1st at the Thunderdome.

sports,Super Bowl LII Key Matchups: Offense vs. Defense,1-Feb-18,5:00 AM,"['Brandon Victor', 'Andrew Hernandez', 'Calvin Thrift']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/super-bowl-lii-key-matchups-offense-vs-defense/,"Kalani Seaman / Daily Nexus Eagles Offense vs. Patriots Defense When Carson Wentz limped to the locker room in Week 14, many sports fans and pundits ""î myself included ""î thought the Eagles season was over. Wentz was and still is an irreplaceable commodity, a quarterback who was playing at an MVP level throughout the season. What we overlooked in our analysis, however, was the balance of the Eagles' offense.
Make no mistake, for the Eagles' offense minus Wentz is set up through their run game. Since the Eagles acquired Jay Ajayi from the Dolphins, he has turned into their workhorse.
Running behind one of the best offensive lines in the NFL, Ajayi has turned into the back that everyone thought he would be this season. But the Eagles have a myriad of talented runners behind Ajayi. LeGarrette Blount, who was a two-down back before Ajayi arrived, still runs as if he is trying to break down a door. Blount is one of the premier goal-line backs in the NFL. Even beyond that, rookie Corey Clement has served as a nice surprise for the team this season and he provides sure hands out of the backfield should Ajayi need a breather on third down; against the Falcons, for example, Clement caught five balls for 31 yards. Luckily for the Eagles, the power run game is something they've had a lot of success and practice with over this season. Former Miami Dolphins running back Jay Ajayi has bruised his way past defenders for at least 50 yards in the Eagles' last three games. LeGarrette Blount has scored a touchdown in each of the Eagles' last two games, his only touchdowns of the season. But it's not simply that the Eagles have two power backs capable of moving the ball downfield. Philadelphia's athletic offensive line has been crucial in allowing for the team's success on the ground. The battle between Philadelphia's backfield and New England's defense all starts on the line. New England's defense ranks 16th in the NFL this season in rushing yards allowed, while the Eagles are first. With the Patriots' run defense being a known weakness, Philadelphia's quick offensive line will surely aim to take advantage of opening lanes for Ajayi and Blount to do what they do best. Philadelphia's mobile offensive line has demonstrated its ability to shift and bring blockers from the weak side to further clear room for the Eagles' power backs. Because of their quickness, the Eagles linemen not only offer strong-side help on the run, but they are also able to reach and take care of the linebackers who would normally clog the holes that Ajayi and Blount need for take-off. Before Wentz's injury, the Eagles' bread and butter was their pass game. While Foles doesn't provide the mobility and big-play threat that Wentz does, he is a competent passer when given the time to make his reads. It also helps that his receiving core is one of the deepest in the NFL.†Alshon Jeffery has managed to stay healthy this season and provides sure hands on the outside. While he is not the player he used to be on the Ravens, Torrey Smith still has 4.3 speed and can provide space underneath by taking the top off the defense. Meanwhile, Nelson Agholor has been one of the biggest surprises this season, going from a first-round bust to a threatening slot receiver in the blink of an eye. Agholor had more than double as many receiving yards this season as he did last season, along with eight touchdowns. And of course, the Eagles' offense still runs through Zach Ertz, the sure-handed tight end whose large frame enables him to be a perennial threat in the red zone. The red-zone threats that the Eagles have ""î Ertz, Jeffrey, and Blount ""î explain why the Eagles are the second-most efficient team in the red zone in the NFL. Even without Wentz, they remain a top-five red zone team. On Sunday, the Eagles offense will match up against a vastly underrated Patriots defense, one that suffers statistically from other teams being forced to try to catch up to their prolific offense. Despite ranking 29th in the NFL in total yardage, the Patriots boast one of the strongest secondaries in the league. Stalwarts Patrick Chung and Devin McCourty man the back line, while Stephon Gilmore and Malcolm Butler shut down receivers on the outside. Both Butler and Gilmore are used to the big moment; it was Butler's interception that sealed the Patriots' Super Bowl victory over the Seahawks, while Gilmore saved the game last week with an acrobatic deflection on a 4th down pass to Dede Westbrook. Where the Patriots struggle, however, is on the defensive line. Their leading rusher, Trey Flowers, has only 6.5 sacks on the season, and the lack of a consistent pass rush could hamper the Patriots. When teams have success against the Patriots, it's typically because they take advantage of this; one example is in week one when Kareem Hunt ran all over New England. Despite their lack of personnel, Matt Patricia, a defensive guru who is catapulting into the head coaching ranks next season with the Detroit Lions, leads New England's defense. Patricia is typically able to mask these deficiencies through his game plans, and if Patricia can make Foles uncomfortable in the pocket, it could be difficult for the Eagles' offense to get rolling come Sunday. Patriots Offense vs. Eagles Defense† The Philadelphia Eagles are looking at a daunting task in handling the offensive scheming of New England Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. The offensive weapons at New England's disposal are plentiful in wide receiver Brandin Cooks, tight end Rob Gronkowski and, of course, four-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback Tom Brady. New England will most likely primarily commit to its pass offense but will look to throw in clever plays at the line of scrimmage using players like Dion Lewis in their backfield. While Brady has enough receivers who can run effective routes, he also has Gronkowski, who is a vital piece of the puzzle. Gronkowski finished the 2017-18 regular season as the team's leader in receiving yards (1,084) and touchdown receptions (8). Such stats display the impactful connection between the tight end and quarterback possesses. The variety the Pats have will require the Eagles to attempt to stop their opponent by penetrating the offensive line and taking down Brady. During the year, Philadelphia led the league in total amount of pressures. If the Eagles can become a constant reminder for Brady in the pocket, the Pats' offense can stagnate at critical points in the game. It will be up to their defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, to figure out a way to use the team's defensive depth to have a chance at containing the dynamic Patriot offense. There is little reason to doubt the ability of the Eagles' defense to limit the Patriots. They have been able to contain much more potent backfields in teams like the Atlanta Falcons. The team also reached its highest mark in recent years in the points allowed category, finishing fourth best in the NFL this season (18.4). Malcolm Jenkins, the Eagles' veteran safety, will be a primary part of their secondary.
Jenkins is a dynamic safety who can fulfill a variety of roles on the field, adapting to every play. The safety can easily line up alongside the line to rush in on a blitz or drop back into the secondary and cover guys such as Cooks or Danny Amendola. Given the dominance of the Patriots in the Super Bowl, it would not be surprising to see the Eagles be successful at creating effective pressure in the pocket and still see Brady lead his team to yet another championship.

sports,Super Bowl LII Sleeper Picks,1-Feb-18,5:03 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/super-bowl-lii-sleeper-picks/,"All-Pro Wide Receiver Santana Moss once said ""úBig time players make big time plays in big time games""ù. Often this is true, whether it be Eli Manning leading the Giants on a fourth quarter comeback, or Jerry Rice cutting through the Bengals defense play after play, many Super Bowls have been decided simply by a great player taking control of the game. Although football is most definitely a team sport, it is also one in which moments and players are mythologized. ""úThe Drive""ù and ""úThe Catch""ù are two examples of how football fans and analysts love to find and memorialize key plays and players, especially in the biggest game of all. Super Bowl LII will be between the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles and the AFC Champion New England Patriots. As a Giants fan who has rooted against both these teams on many occasions, it pains me to say that they both have proved to be the best in their respective conferences without a doubt. Even with key injuries to both squads (Carson Wentz being out for the Eagles, Gronk missing some time for the Pats) they have actually gotten stronger as units as the year has gone on, which is precisely why it is hard to single out who the x-factor's will be on both sides. Instead of just choosing a player who I think will be the best for each team, I split potential players into two tiers based on how likely they are to win Super Bowl MVP and overall what their impact will be on the field. Kevin Son / Daily Nexus The Favorites Quarterbacks have won Super Bowl MVP 28 out of the 51 times the award has been granted. I predict that this year won't be any different as both Tom Brady and Nick Foles, who have the best and second best chance to win the award according to Vegas, pretty much will have to carry their respective offenses. The Eagles and Patriots finished the regular season as bottom 10 rushing teams, and the Pats have only managed to muster up 73.5 yards per game in the playoffs. Foles and Brady have done a good job handling this load so far, as their 122 and 107 QBR show, but it remains to be seen which one will outshine the other. Dark Horses As opponents of the Patriots have learned in the past, the best way to mitigate Tom Brady's impact is to get pressure on him, and if there is one thing Eagles DT Fletcher Cox knows how to do it's creating pressure. His 10 combined tackles in the Postseason is the highest among Defensive Tackles, and while he only has one sack so far the amount of pressure he's created indicates that he's due for some more. If he's able to disrupt the Patriots offensive line that's only given up 3 sacks this year he could be heading home with the SBMVP trophy. On the Patriots side, Tight End Rob Gronkowski could be geared for a big game of his own. After being sidelined in the AFC Championship game with a concussion, Gronk will be looking to take advantage of his size in this upcoming matchup. He'll have about a 6""ù height and 60 pound weight advantage over his primary defender who will be safety Malcolm Jenkins for the Eagles. IF Gronk is able to open up the field for Tom Brady, there's no doubt that the Eagles will have a very tough time staying in the game, and he will likely be adding a Super Bowl MVP trophy to go along with a third championship ring.

sports,"The ""òG.O.A.T.' vs. the Hope: Brady & Foles Prepare for Battle",1-Feb-18,5:10 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-01/the-g-o-a-t-vs-the-hope-brady-foles-prepare-for-battle/,"Photo courtesy of NFLshop.com Not much more can be said about Tom Brady, the New England Patriots' legendary star quarterback. Boasting perhaps the most accomplished repertoire in both current day and league history, Brady has genuinely earned the ""ògreatest of all time' moniker that some fans and players alike have attributed to him. To help bolster this claim, one need not look any further than that once in a lifetime comeback versus the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. As for the Philadelphia Eagles, it's been a season of both success and struggle.
Losing their franchise quarterback, Carson Wentz, due to an ACL injury during their Week 14 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, the Eagles looked to Nick Foles to save the day and their season. That game eventually resulted in a clutch last-minute win for Foles and was enough for Philadelphia to claim the NFC East title and spark the start of this team's underdog tale.
Following both teams' impressive semifinal wins in their respective Conference Championship games, the Patriots and Eagles will now meet this Sunday in Minnesota for Super Bowl LII. In terms of quarterback comparisons, the advantage seems clear-cut in favor of the Brady bunch and his expertise of seven total finals appearances.
With a historically best playoff passer rating of 116.4, however, Foles just might carry the Eagles' offense past all odds. At 352 yards for three touchdowns and no interceptions, Foles demolished the Vikings' league-best defense and has proven just why the Eagles invested such hefty capital in perhaps now the league's best backup quarterback. Considering he's coming off perhaps the most important game of his career, Philadelphia's prodigal son returned home just in time to make the Super Bowl dream a reality. Speaking of the best backup quarterbacks, Brady shares this similarity with Foles because his, and the Patriots', first Super Bowl win came during the very same season he took over the starting role when Drew Bledsoe's year ended back in Week 2 of 2001. As for this postseason, Brady's previous matchup against the Jaguars ended in yet another spectacular win from behind as the Patriots faced a 14-3 deficit during the second quarter of play. Knowing that the Jaguars boasted a top-three defense, Brady wasn't stopped from doing what's now expected of him and coming in clutch with the 290 yard and two touchdown stat-line in order to win the game. ""úHe knows what to do""¶He's a great player, and the team has a ton of confidence in him""¶I know he'll do a great job,""ù Brady said during the Super Bowl's media opening night when asked about how he believes Foles will handle his first championship appearance. It's certain both quarterbacks will be doing plenty of research on how to get the job done come game time, yet it's interesting to see just how their performances will stack up against each other and prove exactly why they both belong in this upcoming and obviously must-win game. Now on football's biggest stage, both teams will go head to head as each wish to make their mark on the history books. Foles, wanting to hand the city of Philadelphia their first Super Bowl victory in franchise history, and Brady, looking for his sixth career Super Bowl ring: It's going to be quite the David versus Goliath storyline as kickoff time approaches.

sports,Edelman's Career Night Gets Gauchos Back on Track With Win Over Hawaii,4-Feb-18,9:12 PM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-04/edelmans-career-night-gets-gauchos-back-on-track-with-win-over-hawaii/,"Akilah Jennings shoots a layup and draws a foul. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus Following its home loss to Cal State Northridge, in which it scored just 30 points, the UCSB women's basketball team used a career night from Drew Edelman to defeat Hawaii in the Thunderdome. Edelman, the redshirt senior, scored her team's first six points and continued to put on a clinic in the post, finishing with a career-high 27 points to go along with 12 rebounds. ""úThey were playing me with single coverage and I've been getting double-teamed a lot so far this season, so playing one on one was nice.""ù Edelman scored 19 of her 27 in the first half alone. With Saturday's 71-61 win, Santa Barbara is now 8-13 overall and 5-4 in conference play. After opening Big West play 3-0, the Gauchos are fifth in the conference standings. While UCSB snapped its two-game losing streak on Saturday, Hawaii has now lost its last two games and lands it in last place of the Big West. Hawaii is now 9-14 overall and 2-8 in conference play. Santa Barbara opened the game with a much-improved shooting effort. The Gauchos were determined to get the ball inside to Edelman early, and they did just that. In the first quarter alone, Edelman had 11 points on 5-of-6 shooting. Hawaii's offense seemed a bit disjointed in the first quarter of play, but a diversified scoring effort from five different players allowed the Rainbow Wahine to keep within a possession after one quarter of play. Up 19-16 to start the second quarter, UCSB kept its foot on the gas, opening with an 8-0 run. The run was led by none other than Edelman, who had 8 in the quarter, and Chaya Durr. After shooting 57.1 percent in the first, Santa Barbara went on to shoot an even better 60 percent in the second. But, the Gauchos weren't only scoring efficiently, they held Hawaii scoreless for nearly five minutes as they constructed their run. Despite shooting 3-for-10 in the quarter, Hawaii used those three buckets to go on a 6-0 run in the last two minutes. The run placed Hawaii within a manageable 8-point deficit, but Edelman sunk two free throws at the end of the first half to go up 10 again, 34-24. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson spoke about her team's performance in the second quarter, in which the Gauchos held Hawaii to only eight points. ""úI thought defensively, we were disruptive and forced turnovers and then scored off those turnovers,""ù she explained. ""úWe were aggressive in passing lanes, we got on the floor for loose balls.""ù Consistency has been an issue for UCSB this season, but the Gauchos entered the third quarter with a sense of focus and determination to keep rolling. A barrage of three-pointers from Akilah Jennings, Sarah Bates, and Sarah Porter capped a 15-5 stretch for the Gauchos, going up 49-29 at the 5:07 mark. Down 20, the Rainbow Wahine, led by Sarah Toeaina, needed to make something happen. Toeaina got a pair of free throws to fall and shortly after made a layup in traffic for 4 points in 40 seconds to cap an 8-0 run, but the Gauchos stayed up 56-40 at the end of the third quarter. Heading into the final quarter of play up 16, Santa Barbara looked to be in control, but the Gauchos' shooting struggles resurfaced as they made only three field goals in the quarter. Contrarily, Toeaina exploded for 13 points in the quarter as part of Hawaii's continued comeback effort. From their 8-0 run to end the third, the Rainbow Wahine kept attacking in order to outscore the Gauchos 21-15 in the fourth. Toeaina, who struggled to get going early in the game, finished with 25 points. Unfortunately for Hawaii, its impressive comeback effort consisting of a 24-7 run was not enough, despite getting within 6. With only 30 seconds to go, Hawaii was forced to foul, sending Bates to the line. Bates, who finished with 13 points to accompany Edelman in double-digit scoring, confidently knocked down both. The Gauchos made all 8 of their final attempts from the charity stripe to close the game out 71-61. Behind Edelman's 27 and 12 double-double, the Gauchos won the battle in the paint, outscoring the Rainbow Wahine 42-27 and outrebounded Hawaii 32-26. Guards Sarah Bates and Drea Toler finished with six assists each, but 21 turnovers by Santa Barbara marked a continuing issue for a team likely to be pressed by opponents. UCSB will look to build off its win at UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton next week.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus It's been a rollercoaster of emotions all weekend long for the UCSB men's volleyball team as it was just recently on the road for two back-to-back matches against Brigham Young University. UCSB split its pair of matches against the Cougars, leaving the Gauchos with a 4-4 record. It managed to pull off an impressive 3-0 shutout over BYU on Friday, but couldn't sustain the momentum as it was shutout itself the following Saturday. BYU is now 6-4. The first set of Friday's first match was quite the offensive spectacle as both teams were making the most of almost every attacking opportunity. Although, the Gauchos were able to run away with it by a close 25-23 end result; with four kills each from UCSB's sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders, sophomore outside hitter Roy McFarland, and junior outside hitter Corey Chavers. In the second set, each sides' defense started to tighten up and the improvements were shown as a total of 6 blocks, 3 apiece, were recorded. For the Gauchos, the standout performer in this one was sophomore setter Randy DeWeese who posted up two of those three blocks from his playmaker position. DeWeese would go on and also conclude the day with a game high of 4 total blocks to go along with his 31 team assists. UCSB would then go on to clinch this second set by a score of 25-20. By this point the BYU Cougars were on the ropes and left their best for last in an attempt to cancel out the away side's clean sweep. Nearing the end of the third set, the Gauchos were down by only a pair of scores as the board read 21-23. Then, thanks to a flurry of attack errors and a service mistake is what ultimately decided the game as the Gauchos would then go on and set up the final 27-25 score to earn both the road victory and clean 3-0 set sweep over the No. 6 BYU. As for Saturday's game two, which took place the next evening, UCSB was in search of pulling off a sweep over their opponents whilst still in enemy territory. Set No. 1 seemed to go in favor of the Gauchos for most of the way, yet failure to halt BYU's .600 hitting percentage in the first set eventually gave the Cougars the early 1-0 lead to start the match. Set two experienced a complete advantage for BYU as their freshman opposite hitter Gabi Garcia Fernandez put up 6 total kills. This one got out of the Gauchos reach early on as the Cougars never gave up the lead through it all and secured the 25-20 victory. Then for the final set, the Gauchos gave it their all but an outstanding defensive performance from the other side of the court held them to a .138 hitting percentage and a doubled amount of blocks to go with. Disappointingly, UCSB then lost the day by a final result of 0-3 as back to back sweeps were experienced on both ends in just a matter of two days. Aggregate team stats show the Gauchos hitting for a cumulative .263 hitting percentage, 11.5 blocks, and 6 aces; compared to the Cougars' .337 hitting percentage average, 16.5 blocks, and 6 aces as well. The UCSB men's volleyball program will continue its 2018 regular season on Wednesday, Feb. 21, with a home game against Pepperdine just before the first conference matchup of the year.

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus It was a busy weekend for the UCSB women's tennis team, who competed in three strenuous matches in just two days. The Gauchos began their weekend with a match at No. 6 Pepperdine on Friday, and then faced off against the University of San Francisco and Kansas State in their home opener on Saturday. Friday's match against Pepperdine ended very poorly for the now 3-4 Gauchos, who were dominated by the Wave 7-0. Things appeared to be unbalanced from the get-go on Friday, with the Wave shutting out the Gauchos in back-to-back games in doubles play. The imbalance continued throughout the match, as the Gauchos struggled to keep up with Pepperdine's four nationally ranked singles players. Sophomore Amit Lev Ari came the closest to winning the Gauchos their only set victory of the day in her first set against Pepperdine junior, No. 44 Dzina Milovanovic; however, Lev Ari fell short 7-6, and lost her subsequent set, which brought the match to an end. The Gauchos' home opener on Saturday would not prove to be much easier, with a challenging doubleheader against USF and Kansas State. Despite suffering a tough loss the day before, the Gauchos went into their home opener with confidence, and a burning desire to bounce back from their trip to Pepperdine. The Gauchos made quick work of USF, routing the Dons 4-0, and losing only a single set on court one. ""úWe were not so happy with the way we competed at Pepperdine, we lost a bit of confidence with that match, but we were able to win against San Francisco. ""úWe were just a little bit better there,""ù Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. The match against the Dons helped the Gauchos regain some of their confidence, and prepare for a more difficult matchup against Kansas State. The Wildcats and the Gauchos fought tooth and nail throughout the afternoon, but Kansas State came out on top with a score of 4-3. The Wildcats pulled ahead early in doubles play, after winning two games back-to-back against the Gauchos, leaving the third unfinished. The Gauchos would soon tie things up in singles play, with the help of freshman Lise Sentenac, who dominated the Wildcats' senior Carolina Lewis with scores of 6-0 and 6-1 in both of her sets. Both teams would trade blows in singles play, and the match would ultimately be decided by the game between UCSB senior Natalie Da Silveira and Kansas State freshman Rosanna Maffei. Da Silveira secured a 6-2 victory in the first set, but Maffei came back in the second set, defeating Da Silveira 6-1. By the start of the third set, the match was tied 3-3, making it the set that would decide the outcome of the match. The pair fought hard, but in the end, Maffei would come out on top 7-6 at the end of the nail-biting final set. It was an emotional loss for the Gauchos, who were hoping for a clean sweep in front of their home crowd. The hard-fought loss to Kansas State brought the Gauchos to a 3-4 record on the season. Coach Thibodeau acknowledged the areas where his team struggled, but he applauded their effort throughout a restless weekend. ""úI thought they fought really hard against Kansas State. We got a bit of a slow start in doubles, but in singles we gave ourselves a chance to win,""ù Thibodeau said. ""úWe left it on the courts, but its good experience to play these kinds of matches because it might happen in the future.""ù Coach Thibodeau and the Gauchos will have plenty of time to recover and prepare for future matches, with their next being against Saint Mary's on Saturday, Feb. 17 and No. 14 California on Sunday, Feb. 18. With two full weeks of rest, the Gauchos are likely to come back stronger for their trip to the Bay Area.

sports,UCSB's Historic Home Streak Lives On with Win Over CSUN,5-Feb-18,9:01 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-05/ucsbs-historic-home-streak-lives-on-with-win-over-csun/,"Gabe Vincent drives to the hoop. Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus It took the UCSB men's basketball 30 minutes to finally put CSUN away on Saturday night. When it finally did, it did so in a hurry. The Gauchos rode a 19-1 run over seven minutes in the second half to a 75-51 victory over the Matadors, pushing UCSB to 18-5 this season and 7-2 in the Big West. The win was also the Gauchos' 11th home victory in a row to open the year, the best home start in school history. ""úWhen Coach (Pasternak) came in, he wanted to establish the Thunderdome as a good home court,""ù sophomore guard Max Heidegger said. ""úHopefully the years will pass and even after we're gone it'll still be rocking. We want to create a legacy here, and that's what Coach [Pasternak] wants to do.""ù A 24-point final margin suggests complete dominance, but that certainly wasn't the case for much of Saturday's game. UCSB and CSUN traded baskets and stops throughout the first half, which saw six lead changes, and neither team was able to get much going offensively. The Gauchos shot just 42 percent from the field, and 20 percent from three, in the first 20 minutes. CSUN was even less effective, shooting 31 percent on field goals, a testament to both UCSB's defense as well as the Matadors' general inability to put the ball in the basket. UCSB's saving grace in that cold first half was their rebounding, which was something of a surprise considering standout big man Jalen Canty's absence Saturday night due to an indefinite suspension for a violation of team rules. Even without the 6-8 forward averaging 7.8 rebounds per game, the Gauchos were able to turn their 10 first half offensive rebounds into 10 second-chance points. While CSUN's shooting problems persisted into the second half, UCSB seemed to find a way to shoot through their problems. The Gauchos rebounded in the last 20 minutes by going 50 percent from the field and 55 percent from three-point land, a major catalyst in their 43-point second half explosion. ""úGuys just started hitting shots,""ù Heidegger said. ""ú[""¶] We were getting the same quality shots all game, but there was a stretch there when they all just started going down, so that helped us increase the lead.""ù Another major catalyst was graduate transfer Leland King II. Playing without his usual frontcourt mate Canty, King was dominant Saturday night with 25 points, tied for his season-high, and 17 rebounds, his season-best outright. ""úThe greatest rebounder I ever coached was Leon Powe at Cal [""¶] and to me Leland's a better rebounder than him,""ù Pasternak said. ""ú[Powe] played for the Boston Celtics. Leland's ranked number 12th in the country in rebounding [""¶] To me, rebounding translates to the next level. I think he's a pro, and he showed it tonight.""ù King controlled the game from the start, with a 10 point, 13 rebound double-double in the just the first half, but really turned on the offensive jets in the last 20 minutes. It was King that kickstarted UCSB's game-sealing run with two straight buckets, including a running hook with 9:52 to go that pushed the forward past 1,000 points in his career. Ami Lakoju was Canty's replacement as King's partner in the starting frontcourt, and the 6-8 junior filled in admirably with 10 points and eight rebounds in 20 minutes. It was Lakoju who built on King's two baskets by outmuscling two CSUN defenders and jamming a putback dunk in over their heads, pushing UCSB's lead to 12 and electrifying the Thunderdome crowd. Saturday's game was particularly special to Lakoju, who was playing in front of his father for just the second time in his college career. The elder Lakoju, a minister and family counselor from Harlem, made the long trip to see his son play, an important boost for the junior. ""úIt was a blessing to see him here,""ù Lakoju said. ""úHe kind of surprised me with that visit but nonetheless I'm happy to see him here and for him to see us get two wins. Point guard Marcus Jackson followed up Lakoju's dunk with two straight jumpers to stretch the lead to 16 points. Jackson, who has struggled with his shot recently, put up 12 points in the second half alone, an important development for the graduate transfer. ""úMarcus has been in kind of a shooting funk, and I wanted to give him some confidence,""ù Pasternak said. ""ú[""¶] Sometimes it becomes mind over matter, so I wanted him to shoot. I started calling plays for him to get his confidence going. He hit a couple of shots and hopefully that'll carry over.""ù Jackson had perhaps the team's most balanced stat line of the night with 12 points, six rebounds and four assists. It was his corner three with 3:48 remaining that put the Gauchos up 68-44 and prompted Pasternak to begin emptying the UCSB bench. Playing without Canty, the Gauchos went to their bench earlier and more often than usual. Jarriesse Blackmon played 18 high-energy minutes, going 4-7 for eight points and six rebounds, while Christian Terrell dished out six assists without turning the ball over once in his 24 minutes. ""úI thought Jarriesse Blackmon gave us incredible energy,""ù Pasternak said. ""úTo get that kind of contribution from him off the bench was really big for us.""ù The strong bench performances allowed Pasternak and his staff to give several starters lighter loads on Saturday. Gabe Vincent played just five minutes in the second half in order to rest a sore calf, and Max Heidegger was able to give his sore back a little bit more of a rest than it got in Thursday's overtime marathon against Hawaii. Whatever rest the Gauchos got on Saturday will be especially important come Thursday night, when UCSB travels to UC Davis to play for Big West supremacy. The Aggies pulled out a 105-104 victory over Long Beach State on Saturday night to keep pace with the Gauchos at 7-2, setting up a major clash next week.

sports,Battle of the Big West Alpha Dogs: Gauchos Travel to UC Davis,8-Feb-18,5:08 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/battle-of-the-alpha-dogs-gauchos-travel-to-uc-davis/,"Pushing through the defense, Leland King II draws a shooting foul. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus For a couple of weeks now, the UCSB and UC Davis men's basketball teams have remained deadlocked at the top of the Big West standings. That will come to an end on Thursday night in Davis. Neither team has been able to edge ahead of the other in conference play, with both sides racking up 7-2 records thus far. Santa Barbara does hold the advantage in the overall mark boasting an 18-5 record compared to Davis's 16-7 record. On Thursday, they'll have their first head-to-head meeting in a clash for conference supremacy. The Gauchos will be coming in hot as winners of their last six games. It's a streak that includes victories over some of the top teams in the conference, such as Hawaii and UC Irvine. UCSB will have a chance to take complete control of the Big West Thursday, but they'll do so away from the friendly walls of the Thunderdome. The Gauchos are 11-0 at home this year, the longest such streak to start a season in school history, but they are just 6-5 on the road. Some of that disparity is attributable to the top-25 schools UCSB has played on the road, but an away win over a top Big West competitor would do wonders for the team's confidence as it heads into the homestretch. A rough start to conference play defensively put the Gauchos in a hole early, but they've battled back since. No team has scored more than 70 points in regulation against UCSB since their Jan. 13 loss to Hawaii, a major turnaround that has helped propel the team up the Big West standings. A strong defense will be especially important against a UC Davis team that's coming off of a 105-point performance, albeit in double overtime, against Long Beach State on Saturday. The Aggies won that game on a running three-pointer by TJ Shorts II with just two seconds to go. That's a major high, and one that the Gauchos might be able to take advantage of on the comedown. To do so, UCSB will rely heavily on sophomore guard Max Heidegger and graduate transfer Leland King II on offense, just as they have all season. King has been particularly potent as of late, as his double-double average over the Gauchos' two wins last week earned the forward the honor of Big West Player of the Week. King is now averaging 16.2 points and 10.6 rebounds on the year and is knocking down about two three-pointers a game at a 42.3 percent clip. That's almost as good as Heidegger's 42.4 percent rate from distance, a sparkling percentage that has propelled the sophomore to his team-leading 20.9 points per game. The major question mark heading into Thursday's game is the status of King's frontcourt mate, Jalen Canty. Canty, who missed Saturday's game against CSUN due to a suspension for violation of a team rule, is averaging about 13 points and eight rebounds per game. As of Monday night, the team had made no announcement on the senior's status for Thursday. UCSB isn't alone in dealing with questions regarding a suspended big man. UCD sent senior forward Chima Moneke home before Saturday's game in Long Beach and has also made no announcement as to whether or not the big man will play. If Moneke is out, that's a major blow to the Aggies. The 6'6""ù forward is averaging a team-leading 18.4 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, and he proved himself on a big stage against Kansas in last year's NCAA Tournament with 20 points and nine rebounds. On Saturday, UCD proved they could fill in for Moneke's absence on the scoreboard, but his rebounding will be tougher to replace. No other player on the team is averaging more than four rebounds per game, and it's likely that 6'3""ù guard Michael Onyebalu will struggle to replicate his 11-rebound performance from Saturday. Without Moneke, the offensive burden would likely fall to junior guards Shorts and Siler Schneider. Both players were successful in doing so against Long Beach, as Shorts put up a team-high 31 points while Schneider was close behind with 27. It's unclear whether either big man, Canty or Moneke, will play on Saturday, but it's a question that will have major impacts on the course of the game, and thus on the Big West. It's taken about a month of conference play for these two teams to meet, and they'll finally do so with very high stakes. Looming suspensions cast a pall over the long-awaited matchup, which will likely be determined by which team can adapt the best and break the deadlock in their favor. UCSB will take on UC Davis at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 8 at The Pavilion. A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 8, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus In the midst of conference play, the UCSB women's basketball team will be on the road for its next two games in which it will face off against UC Riverside and Cal State Fullerton. Saturday's win over Hawaii snapped a two-game losing streak for the Gauchos, who sit at fifth place in the Big West standings at 5-4 and are 8-13 overall. Santa Barbara will face UC Riverside tonight and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. The Highlanders are sixth in the conference at 6-17 and 3-6 in Big West play. Meanwhile, the Titans sit right behind UCR at seventh with a 7-14, 2-6 Big West record. Although the Gauchos have gone 2-4 since starting conference play 3-0, they understand that what's in the win-loss column at the moment isn't the end-all-be-all of their season. During a stretch in November and December to start out their campaign, the Gauchos lost nine-straight games. However, they then went on to win five in a row. UCSB has shown resilience and the ability to heat up, two very useful attributes as the second half of the season progresses. As per usual, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson is focusing on what's to come and how to improve. In preparation for Thursday's contest against Riverside, Henrickson stressed the unique nature of the Highlanders' offense and how her team will defend it. ""úRiverside is a lot of five-out motion, cuts, slips, curls, guards posting. It's a lot of difference. It's a very different style than anyone else in the league, so it's been trying to get comfortable with how we're going to play it,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe need to minimize the number of catches in those spots by their players because it's their motion and movement but players have tendencies. It's a little bit of recognizing who am I guarding and what does my guy like to do.""ù Additionally, Riverside's offense has taken its toll on teams this season through exploiting mismatches. ""úThey're pretty balanced, so they bring some mismatch problems for us,""ù Henrickson said. ""úTheir guards are going to post, which we don't see a lot.""ù Fortunately for Henrickson, the Gauchos have plenty of options at the guard position and can continue to lean on their freshman point guard Sarah Bates as senior guard Drea Toler works toward returning to 100 percent. Bates leads Santa Barbara in scoring during conference play, averaging 14.6 points per game, but she's not just finding the net. Also leading the Gauchos in the assist category, Bates has dished out an average of 3.1 dimes per game in conference matchups. Looking closer at Riverside, the Highlanders have fallen in their last four games, so they're likely eager to get back on track. UCSB's last meeting with Riverside was in last season's Big West Quarterfinals, where the Gauchos won 81-71 to advance. Win or lose against Riverside, Santa Barbara will turn around to visit CSU Fullerton on Saturday. Similar to Riverside, the Titans are in a rut of their own, having lost five in a row. Despite Fullerton's recent struggles, Henrickson again understands that records aren't everything. ""úThey've got good size inside,""ù Henrickson said. ""úGood shooters, good athletes. They're much improved, playing with a lot of confidence. They've had big wins at home and been in one-possession games, so they're much improved from last year.""ù Last season, the Titans went 1-15 in conference play and a dismal 4-25 overall, losing both games in their series against the Gauchos. With the potential to climb the rankings on the road, Santa Barbara is aiming to keep up its pace as well as defensive prowess. ""úI think for us, how aggressive we were in transition, we scored 23 points in transition which is a season-high for us,""ù Henrickson said, ""úI thought we had tremendous energy [against Hawaii] where we were able to take away some of their go-to looks, which is what we want to do against Riverside.""ù The Gauchos will take on UC Riverside tonight at SRC Arena at 7 p.m. UCSB and CSU Fullerton will play at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 10, in Titan Gym.

sports,"Nexus and Answer: The Sweet Life of ""òE-Chill' ""¶ Overseas",8-Feb-18,5:10 AM,['Sean White'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-08/nexus-and-answer-the-sweet-life-of-e-chill-overseas/,"Courtesy of Eric Childress In recent weeks, I managed to catch up with former UCSB men's basketball point guard Eric Childress. Childress, a Class of 2017 graduate, was the team's only senior last season. The final chapter of his collegiate career wasn't the happiest farewell as the Gauchos went a horrid 6-22, 4-12 in Big West play. Since departing from UCSB, Childress has continued to play overseas. A native of Hawthorne, Calif., Childress is a long way from home. But his passion for basketball is the drive that keeps him motivated to continue to chase his dream of playing basketball. Although I was unable to conduct an in-person interview with Childress due to his overseas travels, being able to complete this Q&A session with him was an experience in itself. Before we begin here is the highlight tape of his first year overseas, enjoy: 
Sean White: How was your experience playing in the British Basketball League? How was the transition from college to overseas? Eric Childress:†Playing in the British Basketball League was pretty difficult. I say this only because I feel like the club I was with had the potential to be very talented, but we underperformed and many different circumstances made it hard for us to reach our potential. The transition from college to overseas, I'd say, can be different for every person depending on the country you land in. For me, going to the U.K., I was very fortunate in going to a place where everyone spoke English and it was the most similar to the U.S. With that being said, if I were to start my career somewhere in Asia, South America or even here in Georgia I think I would have struggled at first because of the language barrier and it being such a big culture shock. It's hard for me to just maneuver around town like I was in Leeds. SW:†Did you get in touch with any former Gauchos who play or have played overseas prior to starting your pro career? EC:†Yeah, prior to leaving I talked to players like James Nunally & Orlando Johnson, who came back to Santa Barbara during the summer, and kind of picked their brains about the whole overseas experience. Also, it's easier for me to get in contact with Alan Williams, Nate Garth, Zalmico Harmon and Michael Bryson, so whenever I have a big question that I feel like I can't really get on my own I'll reach out and see if they can offer me some advice from their experiences. SW:†How did you know at the time that Leeds Force was the right fit for you? Did you have an agent help with that choice? EC:†I feel like you never really know which team is the right fit until you get there. You kind of watch film of the league and past seasons, but ultimately the guys you see from the last season are likely gone to another country or [have] signed with another team in the league. When I got to Leeds I had no clue what I was getting myself into. We had, of course, your local players for the team, and many imports, as they call us, from different places such as Houston and Florida in the States, then a player for Greece, one from Switzerland, one from Lithuania and one from Germany. So it's more on the club to make sure our playing styles complement each other when they offer us to play for them. My choice to go play for Leeds was made by my agent and me. We felt like the U.K. was a good starting place for me to go because of the similarities to the U.S., and the British Basketball League (BBL) is a good league with many talented players. SW:†I see you're no longer a member of Leeds Force? Was that by choice or was it a matter of both sides just not being able to agree? EC:†After giving Leeds a shot, the club and I both agreed that things weren't going in the direction we hoped for and mutually decided to go our separate ways. I wish those guys the best over there for the rest of the year. SW:†You played with guys like Alan ""úBig Al""ù Williams, Michael Bryson and more. How often do you stay in touch with them? Do you ever seek advice from them for anything? EC:†One of the greatest things about UCSB ""î and I commend Coach Williams for this ""î was that he brought in some of the best dudes I'll ever meet. With that being said, I speak to pretty much all my teammates from the past days because of the old group chats that we had in college and are still active in. As far as advice, I try to figure out some stuff on my own. If I can't get it and [am] really struggling, then I'll reach out to them or even old high school family such as my coaches and old teammates and see what advice they can offer me in this experience. SW:†Have you had a chance to peep this year's men's basketball team? If so, what have your thoughts been especially since the program now has a new head coach in Joe Pasternack? EC:†This year's team has been amazing. I'm really happy for those guys that had to go through that tough season last year and [am] juiced for Gabe [Vincent] to be out there performing great after that injury last year. Glad to see Jalen [Canty] and Ami [Lakoju] out there on the floor after their situation last year as well. I can't even lie: I was jealous, and I told them this when watching them play against Cal State Fullerton this year. Their play style differs so much from ours last year that it really seems like those dudes that are on the floor are genuinely having fun with the game, and I feel like the most important [thing] is having fun while competing at a high level. I'm happy they adjusted to Coach P's system so quickly, and I think he did an outstanding job with those guys with getting them to compete on both ends of the floor. SW:†What's next for Eric Childress? I see you've recently announced your signing with a team in the country of Georgia; what convinced you to do so? EC:†Yes, I recently signed to play and finish my rookie year here in Batumi, Georgia with BC Batumi. The biggest thing was that I didn't want what happened in Leeds to affect my love for the game. I've been playing and giving my all to this sport for as long as I can remember, and it's always been a dream of mine to be a professional basketball player. That was the biggest choice in deciding to come here and continue on. What also factored in was realizing that I get to travel the world, see many different places and cultures, try different things and gain new experiences that many people aren't fortunate [enough] to do, so I'm blessed to even have this opportunity. SW:†Any good or unfamiliar meals overseas that you liked or disliked? EC:†As for as meals go, I'm one of the pickiest eaters you'll ever meet. Shout-out to my mom and pops for teaching me how to cook. I feel like one day I'll venture out and try something new, but if it doesn't pass the smell test, I don't think it's for me.

The T-No. 13 Gauchos were last in action on Jan. 28 in the Hoosier Invitational, where they were able to beat Harvard University 8-5. The win against the Crimson brought an end to a tournament where UCSB was able to improve their record to 7-3.  UCSB's two-game winning streak has the team excited entering the Triton Invitational as it gives them much needed momentum headed into an opening match where their opponent has also been successful against top-25 opponents.  The Aztecs have had very little playing experience so far in the season, as the team only has a 2-2 record. The victories that came against ranked opponents, such as Harvard and Brown, are signs of an Aztec team that is more than capable of playing with the top of the division.  The most recent game for San Diego was an impressive comeback against Brown University, where the team was able to even the score with less than three minutes left in the final quarter.  Junior Hannah Carrillo was able to put the ball into the back of the net in the second minute of the first frame to score the game-winning goal, giving the Aztecs the victory.  San Diego State also demonstrated their defensive efficiency in their game against Brown, holding the Bears to four goals. Like the Aztecs, the Gauchos have also had their share of defensive success, already posting two shutouts on the season.  UCSB has been able to keep every opponent from scoring above 10 points in a match so far this season, making consistent defensive stops a priority in their game plan. This has simultaneously benefitted their offense by always keeping the game in reach and the ball typically in the hands of the threatening Gaucho offense.  The matchup in the defensive category should be pretty even in this match, despite the Aztecs looking at a more daunting challenge in trying to handle a Gaucho team that has scored 20+ points twice and 10+ points seven times this year.  Backing this capability of explosion for UCSB are the usual suspects of Kate Pipkin, Sarah Kreiser and Sarah Snyder have all shown up in matches ready to make an impact on offense through facilitating ball movement and scoring. This dangerous trio on the attacking side will certainly be a focal point of the Aztecs' defensive focus.  While the three will certainly attract the most attention on the offensive end, the Gauchos have consistently shown a tendency for the entire team to take part in an offensive surge during a game.  These surges and runs during the game can quickly put UCSB ahead, leaving behind a confused and tired defense which is unable to stop the scoring.  This is exactly what San Diego State should look to prevent from happening this Saturday, as a good performance would certainly legitimize a team which has only made an average impact so far.  The Gauchos will play the Aztecs on Saturday, Feb. 10 at 9:50 a.m. † The second scheduled Gaucho game of the Triton Invitational will be played against an opponent yet to be announced on Sunday, Feb. 11.

sports,Gauchos Face Thriving Toreros Looking for Signature Win,9-Feb-18,5:19 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-09/gauchos-faces-thriving-tritons-looking-for-signature-win/,"Nexus File Photo The UCSB men's tennis team heads to San Diego this weekend looking to acquire a key non-conference victory over USD, the four-time defending West Coast Conference champions and a team who ranked No. 47 at the end of last season. The Toreros acquired one of the biggest wins in school history this year when they defeated No. 10 TCU 4-3 in Fort Worth just a couple weeks ago. That victory marked the first time since the school started keeping records in 2000 that USD defeated a top-ten opponent†""î†an impressive feat considering they did so in front of a hostile environment. After starting the season 2-0, USD dropped its last match in straight sets to No. 24 Duke 4-0 to put its overall record at 2-1. One of the other Torero victories came from another Big West opponent, UC Irvine, back on Jan. 18 by a final tally of 7-0. ""úUSD will likely pop up high in the first ITA ""òComputer' rankings that will be released soon because of the win over No. 10 TCU and because they are a good, solid team, the best we've faced since USC and much stronger than the teams we beat this weekend,""ù Head Coach Marty Davis said. ""úPlus, it's on the road where it's always tougher to win.""ù USD features a balanced team this season, led by sophomore Gui Osorio, who was named to the preseason All-WCC men's tennis team. Osorio finished last season 16-8 in singles, playing mostly out of the No. 2 spot in the lineup. This year, USD leans on him out of the No. 1 spot, and his matchup against Gaucho phenom Nicolas Moreno de Alboran will be key in determining the victor on Sunday. The junior UCSB athlete is currently 2-1 on the season with his only loss against No. 13 Brandon Holt. But perhaps the best individual player for the Toreros this season has been sophomore Joel Gamerov, who acquired his first top-25 victory in his career in the match against TCU. Gamerov is building on the success he had in his freshman year, as he finished last season with a 23-11 record in singles. Even the lower spots have stepped up so far for USD this season as freshman David Norfeldt was undefeated before his loss to Duke. ""úThis will be a great challenge for us and an extremely important match for our national ranking,""ù Davis said. ""úWe don't have that many looks at quality top teams in the top 50 this season, so this is an opportunity we need to cash in to achieve our ranking goals for the season.""ù Coming off of two strong performances this past weekend, UCSB will need to ride that momentum in order to compete with the depth and skill of the Toreros. In their match on Friday, the Gauchos were able to take out an overmatched San Diego State team, 6-1. They then followed that up on Saturday with an impressive 6-1 victory over previously undefeated Fresno State. Once again, the Gauchos' depth proved to be one of their key assets. Sophomore Joseph Guillin and freshman Victor Krustev continue to play well in their singles matches, and the duo came back from their doubles loss on Friday with a dominant victory in Saturday's match. ""úI feel good about how we played over the weekend,""ù Davis said. ""úWe especially were able to make some helpful adjustments at No. 3 doubles.""ù UCSB will need to be at their best when they take on the Toreros at 12 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 11 at the Skip and Cindy Hogan Tennis Center.

sports,Gauchos Come Up Short on the Road; Fall to UC Riverside,10-Feb-18,4:00 PM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/gauchos-come-up-short-on-the-road-fall-to-uc-riverside/,"In Thursday night's tightly-contested game against UC Riverside, the UCSB women's basketball team was outlasted by the Highlanders, in the end, losing 84-76. With the loss, the Gauchos fall to .500 in Big West play at 5-5 and move to 8-14 overall despite another big double-double from Drew Edelman. Shooting an efficient 10-11 from the field, Edelman finished with 21 points to go along with 10 boards, both team-highs on the night. The Highlanders snapped a four-game losing streak with their victory over the Gauchos, but are still behind UCSB in Big West Standings. At 7-17 overall and 4-6 in conference play, Riverside remains in 6th place while Santa Barbara holds 5th. Out of the gate, the Gauchos proceeded to play one of their best offensive quarters, especially for being on the road. Although Riverside tied the Gauchos for 23 points in the quarter, UCSB got hot early, making 6 of 10 three-point attempts, to provide answers in the back-and-forth quarter. Sarah Bates opened the game with a three of her own, followed by a three-point play from Edelman down low to put UCSB up 6-2. Bates then made another three to with 6:39 left to make it a 9-4 game, which seemed to wake up UC Riverside's Michelle Curry. Curry scored 11 of her career-high 30 points in the first. Sarah Porter went 3-3 from beyond the arc for 9 of her 12 points on the night. Tied at 23 after one, the Gauchos didn't fare quite as well in the second quarter as they did in the first. After shooting 50 percent from the field and 60 percent from three in the first, Santa Barbara shot just 28.6 percent overall and 20 percent from beyond the arc. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, Riverside shot 80 percent overall to outscore them 22-12 in the quarter. A tale of two quarters for UCSB, no Gaucho made more than one field goal as they were held scoreless in the last 3 minutes of the half. Curry added 6 points for the Highlanders, while Edelman rested the full 10 minutes. Down 35-45, head coach Bonnie Henrickson had the task of re-centering her team's efforts during halftime, and it seems she did just that. Determined not to roll over so quickly, Santa Barbara gave the Highlanders a taste of their own medicine, outscoring Riverside 20-12 in the quarter to head into the fourth down by only 2. Opening the quarter on a 10-0 run, the Gauchos got big production from Edelman, who scored 10 points. The Gauchos also held Riverside to just 5 of 19 field goals, preventing any Highlander from making more than one shot. Drea Toler got a layup to fall at the end of the quarter to get UCSB back on track, down only 55-57. It seemed to be anyone's game entering the final quarter of play, and it stayed that way until the end of the quarter. At the 2:47 mark, Edelman made another lay-in to tie the game at 73, but Riverside then went on an 11-3 run to close out the game 84-76. Edelman added 8 points in the quarter, but it wasn't enough as Riverside used another 11 points from Curry to beat the Gauchos. Despite a competitive effort from Santa Barbara, the Gauchos sent the Riverside to the line 22 times, where the Highlanders knocked down 16 free throws compared to Santa Barbara's four. UCSB, plagued by turnovers in multiple games this season, kept possession of the ball fairly well, committing only 12 turnovers on the night while recording a season-high 25 assists. Sarah Bates joined Edelman and Porter in double figures with 12 points and 5 assists, her twelve games this season scoring in double figures. The Gauchos will have another chance at a victory Saturday when they visit struggling Cal St. Fullerton, which will tip off at 6:00 pm.

sports,Gauchos Topple UC Davis 90-81 to Take Drivers Seat in Big West,10-Feb-18,4:25 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-10/gauchos-topple-uc-davis-90-81-to-take-drivers-seat-in-big-west/,"Pushing through the defense, Leland King II gets a traveling call. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's basketball team finally claimed sole possession of first place in the Big West on Thursday night with a 90-81 win over UC Davis. This was the seventh victory in a row for the Gauchos, tying their 7 game streak earlier in the season for the longest since 2016 and bumping them up to a 19-5 overall, 8-2 Big West record.  The Gauchos also played the role of streak-busters as the Aggies 19 game home win streak, good for the fourth-best†active streak in the NCAA, was cut short on Thursday. UC Davis dropped to a 16-8 overall, 7-3 conference record and now sits in second place in the Big West, just one game back from Santa Barbara in the conference standings. Coming into this game there was plenty of uncertainty in terms of how these two teams were going to match up. While they both had been battling it out in the Big West conference standings since the beginning of the season, the Gauchos and Aggies hadn't actually played against each other yet on the court. Even the Davis students were anticipating this one, as the atmosphere at the Pavilion was almost play-off like at the tip-off with about 3,500 people in attendance. The first half was all UCSB however as the Gauchos came out of the gate scorching hot, building up a twenty point lead at one point and ultimately shooting over 60% from three for the period.  A huge part of SB's first half dominance was the unselfish yet aggressive mindset that first year Coach Pasternack has imprinted on this team. The first four buckets by the Gauchos were all made by different players and all assisted on, and the ball-movement on offense was creating a lot of holes in a usually stout Aggie defense.  We have seen many times throughout the season that just the threat of the Gaucho's three point shooting has opened up countless passing and driving lanes, but when they're actually knocking them down it becomes an almost impossible tasks for opposing defenses to guard them. While it was a great team effort, the best player in the half for UCSB had to be Marcus Jackson. The graduate transfer from Rice finished the half with 15 points on 6-8 shooting, and continues to prove how important he is to the facilitation of the offense this year.  While it should come to no surprise that Jackson is able to light up the scoreboard every now and then (he was the 35th player in Rice history to score 1,000 points in his time there), his high basketball IQ and ability to knock down the three adds an entirely new element to this Gaucho team that along with the performance of Leland King II and Max Heidegger so far has created arguably the best trio in the conference. Even with all that SB was doing great the deficit was only 12 points going into halftime, mostly because of the play of Junior TJ Shorts II. The Aggie guard ultimately finished the game with 28 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds, and was tasked with making sure the lead didn't get out of hand for most of the game.  Even at just 5'9, his quickness and shooting ability definitely puts him up on the short-list of best players in the conference, and he will be a big part of the scouting report for the Gauchos when they take on this team again next week. UC Davis actually made a run late in the second half, cutting the lead down to five with a minute to go in the game. Junior guard Siler Schneider broke past the 1,000 point mark with his first shot in the second half, a huge milestone for a player at this level, and scored 10 points in the last frame to keep the Aggies in the game.  The Gauchos were able to hold Davis off thanks in part to the contributions of Junior Jarriesse Blackmon, whose 8 points off the bench in the half could not have came at a better time.  While Blackmon hasn't been able to get much going on the offensive end in his time in this season, if performances like this become consistent it would be huge for this team. Looking ahead, the Gauchos stay on the road as they get set to take on the other second place team in the Big West, Long Beach State. Although Thursday's win was big, UCSB knows more than anyone that the season is not close to over, and they'll have to keep fighting for anything they get. UCSB takes on LBSU at 7 p.m. on Thursday.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus After losing to UC Riverside Thursday, the UCSB women's basketball team returned to form Saturday night, defeating Cal St. Fullerton 59-52. The Gauchos forced Fullerton into turning the ball over on 19 occasions, and for much of the game, the Titans struggled against Santa Barbara's defense. With the road win, UCSB moves to 9-13 overall and remains at 5th in the Big West at 6-5 in conference play. Redshirt senior Drew Edelman continues to play a huge role for the Gauchos, scoring 22 points and grabbing 11 boards against the Titans Saturday night. Edelman notched her third straight double-double in the victory and is averaging a dominant 23.33 points and 11 rebounds over the last three contests. While Santa Barbara held its single-game losing streak for roughly 48 hours, Fullerton was handed its seventh loss in a row. The Titans, at 7-16 overall and 2-8 in conference, are 8th place in Big West standings; however, they're in a better position than last year when they finished 4-25 overall and just 1-15 in the Big West. Fortunately for Fullerton, the Titans will have a chance at redemption when they visit the Thunderdome Thursday of this week to take on Santa Barbara again. UCSB opened Saturday night's game with a slow and steady first quarter in which Fullerton was held to only 7 points. While the Titans got on the board first with Daeja Smith layup, Edelman answered with a bucket of her own. Edelman's bucket led to another for the 6'4 forward, then shots by Sarah Bates, Drea Toler, and Aliceah Hernandez fell for a 10-0 run over nearly 8 minutes. With 2:06 to go in the quarter, the Titans finally got a basket, a three, but Edelman again answered to make it 12-5 with 1:11 left. After two free throws by the Fullerton's China Henderson put the Titans within 5, Sarah Bates sunk a three of her own to close out the quarter, UCSB leading 15-7. Shooting 2 of 13 and registering 8 turnovers in the quarter, the Titans had plenty to improve on heading into the second quarter. Using a 5-0 run to start the quarter, the Titans cut the Santa Barbara lead to 3 before the Gauchos got a bucket from none other than Edelman at the 6:47 mark. Edelman's jumper sparked a 12-0 run by the Gauchos to take a 27-12 lead just under the five-minute mark. With 3:27 to go, Sarah Bates hit her second three of the quarter for the Gauchos' last score of the half. Bates finished the game with 12 points and 5 rebounds to accompany Edelman in double figures for the third straight game. The Titans closed out the quarter behind a Hannah Thompson layup and Triann Thompson jumper, with both teams failing to score in the last 2 and a half minutes of the half. Edelman got the second half of play rolling with back to back baskets, giving the Gauchos their largest lead of the game, 36-18. Fullerton answered with an 11-2 run, forcing Santa Barbara to take a timeout at the 4:14 mark as their 18 point lead was diminished to 9. Following the timeout, Titan Jade Vega drained a three to make it 38-32, but a three by Hernandez and then Makala Roper with 7 seconds left allowed Santa Barbara to keep a 9-point lead, 47-38, heading into the final ten minutes of play. Hannah Thompson had 8 of her team-high 13 points in the third for Fullerton, while Edelman had 8 for the Gauchos. The fourth quarter saw UCSB go through a scoring drought that lasted over half the quarter before Edelman got a layup to fall with only 4:21 to go. The Titans were busy during Santa Barbara's dry stretch, putting together a 7-0 run. After Edelman's basket, a Triann Thompson three-ball put the Titans within a single point, down only 49-48 with four minutes left. Roper got UCSB up 51-48 with a layup, but two more jumpers by Fullerton gave the Titans the 52-51 lead with 2:28 remaining, forcing a Gaucho timeout. Despite an amazing comeback by the Titans to take the lead, Fullerton failed to score following UCSB's timeout. The Gauchos closed out the game using yet another Edelman bucket and enough made free throws to pull out the 59-52 victory. The exciting finish will make for an interesting rematch on Thursday when UCSB will host the Titans at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's tennis team will look to bounce back from a tough loss against USD over the past weekend when the team comes home to face off against both the University of San Francisco and University of Pacific this weekend. UCSB will look for bounce back performances from its top players this week. Last week, Santa Barbara top two seeds ""ì junior Nicolas Moreno De Alboran and senior Simon Freund ""ì dropped their sets. While the team showed grit and resilience in almost coming all the way back from a 3-0 deficit, including a standout individual performance from freshman Joseph Rotheram, it will need to start the match off much stronger if it truly hopes to capitalize on the momentum the home crowd brings. On Saturday, the Gauchos will take on a Dons team that has started to gather its footing on the court as of late. While it only has a 2-3 record, USF played No.5 USC competitively last week. The Dons had a chance to win the match before they dropped two tiebreakers in singles. Nonetheless, USF will pose a challenge to a UCSB team that will need to stay motivated following its tough loss. While the Dons have just seven players on their roster, all six of their starters played on last year's team that finished with a 10-14 record. Senior Johan Joenhagen, a transfer from the University of Utah, leads the charge for USF. He finished last season with an 18-14 record, and won his doubles match against USC alongside sophomore Mert Zincirli, who also boasted a winning record in singles matches last season. After getting swept last week in doubles, UCSB will need to improve upon its play if it hopes to take the opening point, as the Dons have only lost the doubles point once this season. The Gauchos will also benefit from having a week of rest; last week, the team was plagued with the flu, which held freshman Victor Krustev out of the match. Following their match against USF, the Gauchos will take on Pacific on Sunday. Pacific has limped its way to a 1-6 record, but hasn't played at full strength yet all season due to a myriad of injuries and illnesses. In fact, in the match against Utah (a 7-0 loss), the team only had four players who were available. That being said, the team still has plenty of talent, as evidenced by their 13-14 record last season, and only needs one strong performance to get back on their feet this season. The Tigers are led by standout freshman Mikayel Khachatryan, who holds a professional ATP rating in doubles. After sitting out for a year due to NCAA rules, he has quickly catapulted to the No. 1 spot for the Tigers. Much like USF, Pacific has won the majority of its points this season through doubles, despite their struggles in singles. In addition, sophomore Akram El Sallaly was named as an honorable mention to the All-WCC doubles team, and played in 24 of 25 matches for Pacific last year. ""úHopefully, we'll have another great crowd,""ù Head Coach Marty Davis said. ""úHaving fans there keeps us from letting down, and both USF and Pacific are dangerous. †These are both good teams and we'll need to play well to win.""ù UCSB takes on USF on Saturday, Feb. 17 at 1 p.m. at the Rec Cen courts, and then matches up against Pacific on Sunday, Feb. 18 at 1 p.m. at the Rec Cen courts as well.

sports,Gaucho-Mania: MBB Carries 7-Game Streak Into LBSU,15-Feb-18,5:10 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/gaucho-mania-mbb-carries-7-game-streak-into-lbsu/,"Brandon Davis dribbles the ball before passing it to his teammate. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's basketball team is riding high. Winners of their last seven games and sitting in first place in the Big West with a conference record of 8-2 and an overall record of 19-5, the Gauchos can afford to be proud of their season so far. What they can't afford, however, is complacency. The next week and a half will likely be UCSB's toughest stretch of basketball until the Big West Tournament with games against Long Beach State, UC Davis and UC Irvine. All three teams are within two games of the Gauchos for first place. It's a brutal stretch of games, but it's also a chance for UCSB to solidify its position atop the standings and to set the tone before the Big West Tournament in early March. The road to the NCAA Tournament will likely go through at least one of these three teams, after all. The first two teams on the schedule, Long Beach State and UC Davis, are both locked in a three-way tie with Cal State Fullerton for third place in the Big West. They are behind the Gauchos and the Anteaters, respectively. First up are the Long Beach State 49ers, who have struggled against their peers in the Big West standings. The 49ers are 1-4 in games against UCD, UCI and CSUF, with the lone win coming against the Titans back in January. Those four losses make up the entirety of Long Beach's conference blemishes. The 49ers are 7-4 in the Big West, and they have suffered from some bad luck with three single-digit losses. Offensively, the Long Beach game plan revolves around transfer senior Gabe Levin. The 6-7 forward is averaging a team-high 18.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game in around 30 minutes of action a night. Levin has outright led the 49ers in scoring in all but two of their Big West games, and is leading the conference in scoring in Big West play. Unsurprisingly, the senior is key to Long Beach success, and is a common focal point for defenses. Opposing defenses can afford to focus on Levin because his supporting cast hasn't done much to make them pay for doing so. The Gauchos have four players ""ì Max Heidegger, Jalen Canty, Leland King II and Gabe Vincent ""ì between Levin and his next closest teammate in conference scoring. Part of that is due to junior transfer guard Bryan Alberts's nine-game absence due to injury, but the Gonzaga transfer has been slow to readjust since returning to the lineup four games ago. Junior forward Temidayo Yussuf has stepped up to give the 49ers another low post threat, and put up a 17 point, 11 rebound double-double in his most recent game against Cal Poly. The 49ers will host the Gauchos on Thursday, which plays to a major advantage for a Long Beach State team that is 7-4 at the Walter Pyramid and just 5-8 in away games. The Gauchos, on the other hand, have proven themselves to be able road warriors with a 7-5 away record, including a major win in Davis over the Aggies most recently. That win last Thursday is what propelled UCSB to their solitary perch atop the standings, but it's unlikely to be a comfortable position. Even if the Gauchos are able to fight off the 49ers on Thursday, they'll then have to take on the Aggies once more on Saturday, this time in the Thunderdome. With a home winning streak of 11 games to start the season, the longest such run in school history, the Gauchos have reason to feel confident even against such formidable and motivated guests as the Aggies. In the first matchup, UCSB controlled much of the game, aside from a strong stretch run by UC Davis to make things close late in the game. Junior forward Jarriesse Blackmon, receiving extra minutes in the absence of Canty, was instrumental late in the game with eight points, all in the second half. The Gauchos have been able to overcome Canty's absence due to a suspension for violating team rules, but the team has made no announcements on the timetable for his return. Barring a change in status before Thursday, UCSB will likely have to adapt once again. Against UC Davis, the Gauchos were able to do so thanks to a balanced team offensive effort. Four players finished in double-digits, with Leland King II leading the way with 19 points and 15 rebounds, his fifth double-double of Big West play. UCSB won't be the only team dealing with a mysterious and impactful suspension on Saturday. UCD's star forward, Chima Moneke, has missed the team's last three games after being sent home prior to the team's Feb. 3 game against Long Beach State. While the Gauchos are 2-0 without their suspended forward, the Aggies have struggled a bit more, going 1-2 while sliding down from first place in the Big West to a tie for third. The reasons and timetable for Moneke's return are still up in the air, so it's quite possible both teams will once again be shorthanded on Saturday. Junior guard TJ Shorts II has stepped up in Moneke's absence with almost 27 points per game in the last three games. Junior Siler Schneider has also taken on an expanded role, but the Aggies haven't been able to fully replicate Moneke's production. The Gauchos have a tough midterms week ahead of them, with two games against teams with a combined conference record of 14-8. A successful week however, would cement the team's status as the one to best in Big West play, and push UCSB past 20 wins for the first time since 2009-10. The Gauchos take on Long Beach State on Thursday in Long Beach at 7 p.m. The 'Chos then host UC Davis in the Thunderdome on Saturday at 2 p.m. A version of this story appeared on p. 15 of the Feb. 15, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,"No ""¶ The Dallas Cowboys Are Not ""úAmerica's Team""ù",15-Feb-18,5:10 AM,['Kendra Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/no-the-dallas-cowboys-are-not-americas-team/,"Kevin Chan / Daily Nexus We all know nostalgia. As a '90s baby, I get it. I remember everything from the bulky SEGA Genesis cartridges to when PlayStation was the lone wolf and Xbox wasn't even invented yet. But no matter how great those memories make me feel, the realization is ""¶ this isn't the '90s anymore. The past belongs in the past, and it's time we all stop living in the past and come to terms with reality ""ì The Dallas Cowboys are not America's Team. Calling the Dallas Cowboys America's Team is an insult that America just does not deserve. Sports is all about, ""úWhat have you done for me lately?""ù And let's be honest: the Cowboys haven't done anything. I could sit here and try to convince you that the Pittsburgh Steelers should be America's Team because they have the most Super Bowl victories (for now), or I could tell you that Captain America himself, Tom Brady, and his dynasty-driven Patriots are the true heroes of America, but I won't. Instead, let's use logic to distinguish why the Cowboys not only aren't America's Team but in fact, they're a team not many in America even like. First off, it is imperative that an avid sports fan knows exactly where the term ""úAmerica's Team""ù even comes from. Legendary sportscaster John Facenda coined the term when he referred to the Dallas Cowboys as ""úAmerica's Team""ù during the highlight reel of their 1978 season. You don't have to do the math to know that's over four decades ago. Next, let's talk about what really matters: Super Bowl victories. How are the Cowboys in the hardware department? The last Super Bowl the Dallas Cowboys won was in 1996. Dubbing them America's Team when they haven't had a championship in over 20 years is a pretty big loss for America. Though it can't be overlooked that the Cowboys do have five Super Bowl wins from years past, most of those wins were before some of us were even born. Sure, that doesn't take away the fact that those championships are accomplishments that were very real, but, again, the name they still carry is highly outdated. In retrospect, the Cleveland Browns were dominant in the 1950s. Does that mean they still get brownie points for what they used to be? Absolutely not. Had football fans been calling them America's Team back then, up until today, people would really be rethinking that now. Still not convinced the Cowboys aren't the team they once were? The Jacksonville Jaguars have more postseason wins in the past 20 years than the Dallas Cowboys do. Up until their most recent breakout season and their AFC Championship game loss to the New England Patriots, the Jacksonville Jaguars hadn't had a winning season in ten years and hadn't won more than five games in a year since 2010. And yet they still have more playoff wins than the Cowboys do. Sure, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones would like to convince you that his flashy stadium and gorgeous cheerleaders establish them as America's Team, but no. America isn't just flashy; America gets stuff done. Something these current Dallas Cowboys wouldn't know anything about. It's ironic if you think about it: Jerry Jones has got billions and billions of dollars, but sadly, he still can't seem to buy another Super Bowl win. And for all of you folks who miss Tony Romo and what he (debatably) brought to the table, I've got something for you: Blake Bortles, who just became a starting quarterback in the 2017-2018 season, has as many playoff wins as your old beloved Romo who played for 14 seasons. Don't know who Blake Bortles is? My point exactly. In the words of Jay-Z: ""úMen lie, women lie, but numbers don't.""ù And the numbers for the Cowboys, or lack thereof, speak volumes. So the next time you find yourself watching yet another unbearable Thanksgiving showdown between the Dallas Cowboys and some other team who is probably more deserving of a home game, I challenge you: Don't call the Cowboys America's Team. Instead, just change the channel. They probably won't be in the Super Bowl anyway. A version of this story appeared on p. 9 of the Feb. 15, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,"UCSB Looks to Stay Afloat in Big West Conf., Host CSUF",15-Feb-18,5:02 AM,['Kendra Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/81064/,"Makala Roper passes the ball past her opponent. Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus The UCSB women's basketball team is due to face off against the Cal State Fullerton Titans tonight at home in the Thunderdome. These two teams are very familiar with each other as of late, since they just matched up against each other last Saturday, Feb. 10 on CSUF's home court. In their last bout, the Gauchos defeated the Titans in a low-scoring battle, 59-52. The win by the Gauchos put them at 9-14 for the season and 6-5 in the Big West, while CSUF went down to 7-16 overall and 2-8 in conference play. UCSB mounted an 18-point lead at the start of the second half, leading the home team 36-18, which would be Santa Barbara's biggest advantage of the game. The visitors continued to dominate, riding a 47-38 lead going into the fourth quarter of the game ""ì but nearly faltered late, letting their opponents gain headway. The game, though it was close, ended with Santa Barbara getting the lead back and gaining the victory. Working hard for every basket they got, UCSB was able to edge out the home team by shooting a slightly higher field goal percentage (42.6 percent), compared to Cal State Fullerton's (39.2 percent). Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman had another big game, achieving her third straight double-double with a stellar performance consisting of 22 points on 10-for-15 shooting and 11 rebounds. Junior guard Hannah Thompson led the Titans with 13 points, and freshman forward Carolyn Gill had a commanding 11 points and 8 rebounds. Gill has been a big factor for CSUF both offensively and defensively, as she got buckets and proceeded to force the Gauchos to commit several turnovers. The tandem duo of Thompson and Gill will be worth watching for Santa Barbara in the next game. Bench play for UCSB will need to be productive to keep up with CSUF's bench play. Freshman guard Triann Thompson and freshman forward Xinavane Foreman give the Titans a spark off the bench, and will need to be contained on Thursday. Thompson flirted with a double-double, contributing eight points and seven rebounds, while Foreman ended the game with six points and five rebounds. When asked about what the team did right to end the game with a win and what she plans on implementing for Thursday's matchup, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson noted: ""úI thought defensively we played great and had good pressure on the ball. We defended their half court sets. But give them credit. They did a great job,""ù Henrickson said. ""úThey shot over 50 percent in both the third and fourth quarter to make it a ball game and take the lead. So we'll take what we did to get up nearly 20, we'll take what we didn't do to give up and lose the lead and then we'll take what we did to win the game. So there are three lessons in that.""ù Henrickson went on to speak about how the team game plan for the upcoming game will not differentiate much from their game plan the last time the Gauchos played the Titans just a few days ago. The visiting Gauchos showed a big defensive presence against Cal State Fullerton in the matchup and will need to bring that same energy and pressure on Thursday, if they want to end the game with the same result. Though CSUF is only 2-8 in conference play, Henrickson made it known that their upcoming opponents are not to be taken lightly. ""úYou can't look at their record and say ""òthey are this, because this is what their record is.' They're not. They have been in single-digit games, just like ours. We don't do that going into the game,""ù she explained. ""úWe are hunting and building momentum to try and get success. We've got to make sure to bring our A-game for forty minutes because we did for a chunk of the game, but obviously not when we allowed them to shoot such a high percentage from the floor. They got layups, offensive rebounds and got to the free throw line. We've got to turn them over and be more aggressive.""ù Santa Barbara will need to remain focused on both ends of the court and be more conscientious about keeping any lead they build so as to obtain and sustain the advantage against CSUF.

sports,UCSB Returns to Play With Matchups Against St. Mary's and No. 15 Cal,15-Feb-18,5:04 AM,['Andrew Bishop'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-15/ucsb-returns-to-play-with-matchups-against-st-marys-and-no-15-cal/,"Stephanie Yamada lunges for a short ball. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus After a much-needed weekend off, the UCSB women's tennis team will travel to the Bay Area to compete against Saint Mary's of Calif. on Saturday, followed by the No. 15 California on Sunday. The Gauchos have spent the past weekend recovering from their strenuous weekend before, which consisted of three matches over just two days. After a decisive 7-0 loss to Pepperdine on Feb. 2, the Gauchos split their home opening matches the day after with a 4-0 victory against the University of San Francisco and a nail-biting 4-3 loss to Kansas State. After going 1-2 during the weekend of their home opener, Head Coach Simon Thibodeau knew his players needed some time to recover and work on aspects of their game that might need improving. ""úWith three matches in two days with one player injured, we just tried to take a nice week off,""ù Thibodeau said. ""úWe were back at it [Monday] morning, hitting with more heights and more consistency and always better percentage shots. We served a bit more and played points with more discipline, and we'll play in more point situations as we lead up to the matches.""ù As things appear to be back in full swing, the 3-4 Gauchos gear up for a challenging Saturday matchup against Saint Mary's. The Gaels, who are 2-4 on the season, are a familiar opponent to the Gauchos, who defeated the 'Chos 4-3 last year. Both Saint Mary's and UCSB have only one opponent in common this season in No. 13 UCLA, whom they both lost to, 4-0 and 4-2 respectively. Based on last year's match and their scores against a common rival, it is fair to say that the match slightly favors the Gauchos. Despite a possible advantage, Thibodeau and his players know they are in for a contentious Saturday afternoon against the Gaels. ""úThey're tough. We beat them 4-3 last year, and it took everything, so we've got to be ready. We'll have to just execute and play well at each position. It's very winnable everywhere, but it's also very competitive everywhere, so anything can happen,""ù Thibodeau said. While the Gauchos currently have their sights set on defeating Saint Mary's, they are continually mindful of their looming battle against No. 15 Cal on Sunday. The 3-1 Golden Bears have been dominant this season, dropping only one match to another ranked opponent, the then No. 11 ranked University of Texas. The Bears roster features two nationally ranked singles players in No. 33 junior Olivia Hauger and No. 61 senior Karla Popovic and the No. 40 doubles pairing, which consists of the two as well. Sunday's match is shaping up to be one of the most challenging matches of the season for the Gauchos, who are currently 0-3 against ranked teams. Despite the difficult road ahead, the Gauchos are determined and intend on taking things one match at a time without letting their ranked match on Sunday distract them from the task at hand. ""úThey've dealt with a bit of injuries, so we're looking to go there and try to get two wins. Right now we're focused on Saint Mary's, and we haven't touched Cal too much yet in preparation,""ù Thibodeau said. ""úIt's nice to get some ranked wins, but the big picture is really to play well and get better to win the Big West.""ù Unfazed by yet another ranked matchup, the Gauchos head into this weekend rested and well prepared in search of finishing the weekend off above the .500 mark. The Gauchos' match at St. Mary's is set to take place on Saturday, Feb. 17, at 12 p.m. UCSB's match at Cal is set to take place on Sunday, Feb. 18, at 12 p.m. as well.

sports,Baseball Fever: UCSB Begins 2018 Season on the Road,16-Feb-18,12:39 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-16/baseball-fever-ucsb-begins-2018-season-on-the-road/,"Ben Brecht pitches for a strikeout. Eric Swenson/Daily Nexus In 2016, the UCSB baseball team exceeded all expectations, setting a new program best in overall wins with 43 on the season and earning a berth to the college world series for the first time in school history. That playoff run was truly a Cinderella story, one that ended too soon, without an NCAA championship, but gave much hope for the future. Fast forward one year later, and if 2016 was a Cinderella story, then 2017 for UCSB was a fall back to reality. Coming into 2017, Santa Barbara was expected to finish at least third in the conference and was actually ranked coming into the year at No. 19 in the country. Of course, nothing went as expected. The Gauchos would go on to finish with a very disappointing 24-32 overall record and a Big West worst 8-16 conference mark. Both records were the worst in the Andrew Checketts era and the 24 victories were the lowest win total since the 2010 season. Kevin Son / Daily Nexus A large part of what went wrong last year for UCSB last year was pitching. While Checketts is known for his ability to build a solid pitching staff, injuries played a huge factor in the Gauchos' inability to put together a solid rotation for the entirety of the campaign. As a team last year, the Gauchos bullpen accumulated a 5.24 ERA, the second-worst mark in the Big West. That mark was also ranked 183 out of the 295 NCAA D-I programs. This year, UCSB hopes to turn this around as it returns some good arms while also adding a couple to the rotation. Junior right-handed pitcher Noah Davis returns for his third year at Santa Barbara, one he hopes can bring some health to his r√©sum√©. As the primary Friday starter last season, the Huntington Beach native posted a 7-4 record in 13 starts with a 4.63 ERA. He finished with a career-high in strikeouts with 65 but did battle injuries throughout the year. If all is well health-wise, Davis should resume as the Friday starter. Along with him, the bullpen returns midweek starter, Ben Brecht. The true sophomore posted a 3.99 ERA in 14 appearances, eight of them starts along with tallying a 4-2 record. Another key returner is Chris Lincoln. In 28 innings, the sophomore gave up 31 hits and 15 earned runs, but showcased a well of talent in the strikeout department, tallying 25. While Brecht and Lincoln will hope to showcase more talent this year, fans seem to know what to expect out of senior right-hander Stevie Ledesma. The backyard kid, plucked from SBCC, was always the first call in a decisive game and he didn't disappoint. Though his 2-5 record is a bit disappointing, the senior tallied 57 strikeouts in just 43.2 innings pitched. Of course, with a lot of strikeouts comes to a lot of opportunities to hit some stuff at the plate. Ledesma had a 6.80 ERA and gave up six dingers, tied for second-most on the team. Newcomers to the pen are redshirt freshman Jack Dashwood and Chris Troye. Dashwood was the cream of the crop of a wonderful recruiting class two seasons ago but sat out the 2017 campaign due to injury. As for Troye, his story is a bit more interesting. Brought in as a catcher, the true freshman has shown some ability to be a pitcher. The Brentwood native has pitched to speeds of 97 mph, showing promise. Now let's see if he can put it together in a real game. Batting wise, the Gauchos are also in a precarious position. UCSB lost two of its top three batters in terms of batting average including Austin Bush, whose 20 home runs set a new program record last season. However, Santa Barbara still retains a lot of talent. Redshirt sophomore Tommy Jew batted .295 last season and had the second most RBI's on the team with 30. The center fielder is also very talented defensively, thus setting the stage for him to have a breakout year. Speaking of a breakout year, sophomore Armani Smith is due for one big time. The outfielder showed tremendous promise last season batting .285 and slugging .397, but even more, promising is how hard his swing is. Other key returners are the Louisville slugger Sam Cohen, who had eight home runs last season, and shortstop Clay Fisher, who will not be playing the field until his shoulder has completely healed but will see some action at the plate as a DH. The team who stands in the way of the Gauchos on opening weekend is San Diego State, a team who won 42 games last season and a Mountain West Championship. The Aztecs are in the same position as the Gauchos were last season, hoping to exceed expectations following a tremendous season. Defeating UCSB in a best of three series to begin the year would be a good gauge of where the team is at early, something the coach himself alluded to. Senior shortstop David Hensley and sophomore right-handed pitcher Logan Boyer are two notable returners for the Aztecs and were also named to the 2018 all-MW preseason team. The team was picked to finish second. Although the Gauchos will be facing a tough team to open the season, the most important thing for them is working on what they can get better at. This early in the season, nothing is set in stone. This is a team that is comprised of solid returners, but if it wants to excel, it needs another Armani Smith to step up in their first year of collegiate action. Regardless of what happens this weekend, one thing is for certain; Checketts and the team have put last year behind them. With that brings hope that we can be cheering this team on at Omaha come mid-June. UCSB opens its season against San Diego State at 6 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 16 at Tony Gwynn Stadium.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus It was a special 40 minutes in the Thunderdome on Thursday night. It was the annual ""úPlay4Kay""ù game, and the Gauchos sported pink in an effort to raise cancer awareness. After facing Cal State Fullerton that previous Saturday, UCSB won its second consecutive game against Cal State Fullerton, defeating the Titans 78-59. It's the eighth consecutive loss for the CSUF, as the Titans have now been swept by the Gauchos this regular season. This win places Santa Barbara at 10-14 overall and 7-5 in the Big West. In contrast, the loss drops CSUF to 7-17 overall and just 2-9 in the Big West. The Gauchos are now two games over .500 in the conference and are currently sitting at the fourth seed. The Titans were shorthanded for the game, as their redshirt junior center Daeja Smith was out with an injury, and their freshman forward Carolyn Gill out with an illness. UCSB redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman, coming off her third game with a double-double, came close to one yet again. Along with smashing down a game-high 20 points, she also grabbed 8 rebounds, which was also tied for a game-high, as she elevated the game for the Gauchos. Senior guard Makala Roper started in place of injured freshman point guard Danae Miller, and nearly finished the game with a strong triple-double. She contributed 11 points, notched 7 rebounds, and tied her career-high of 9 assists. The home team got out to an early lead, but its opponents stormed back to gain the lead and made the score 9-8 halfway through the first quarter. It was all USCB from then on out, as Santa Barbara went on a run that carried its way well into the second quarter, and suddenly the score was 32-11. A lot of the run was attributed to Edelman's eight points in the paint. UCSB packed the paint and regulated it all night, keeping CSUF to just 18 paint points all game, compared to its dominating 38 points down low. It was 41-29 at the end of the first half, and Santa Barbara looked to be in a commanding position. The home team continued to heavily outscore its opponent for the remainder of the game, as the Titans only managed to get within an eight-point deficit, cutting the score to 50-42 at one point during the second half. Santa Barbara held its opponents to a 21-for-61 shooting performance ""ì a 34 percent shooting night ""ì while it scored 28-of-55 shot attempts at an impactful 50 percent. Despite having faced the Titans just five nights before, the Gauchos knew they couldn't let their guard down against a team hungry for a win. ""úIt was about who was going to make the least amount of mistakes, and it was about who was going to do more of what worked for them in the last game and do less of what didn't,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úWe reduced the stretches where we don't execute or do our job. If you're trying to get it right, you will improve. And this group has really improved.""ù Things in the Big West are heating up, and the Gauchos are beginning to pick up momentum. They've had some rough close losses along the way, but Coach Henrickson is certain that this team is determined. ""úWe know we have to sustain the effort and the intensity and the activity that it takes to be successful. We know we are who we believe we are,""ù she said. The confidence is palpable with UCSB, and it will need to carry that into its next game agaiunst UC Irvine. Santa Barbara will play its second consecutive game at home, as the Gauchos will host UCI at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 17 at the Thunderdome.

sports,Gauchos Dismantle Irvine by 28 points for Third-Straight Win,19-Feb-18,5:00 AM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-19/gauchos-dismantle-irvine-by-28-points-for-third-straight-win/,"Sarah Porter heads for the hoop. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Led by five Gauchos finishing in double-digit scoring, the UCSB women's basketball team snapped UC Irvine's seven-game win streak, defeating the Anteaters 82-55. The Gauchos came to play Saturday night, demonstrating confidence and a new sense of direction during their blowout of the second-place Anteaters. ""úWe didn't stop attacking,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úWe stayed aggressive and we buckled down and still defended when we couldn't score. Those two things we haven't been consistent with but we were pretty good tonight. We kept our foot on the gas pedal.""ù The Gauchos have won their last three games and are now tied with rival Cal Poly for third in the Big West at 8-5 in conference play and 11-14 overall. With the loss, Irvine remains second in the Big West standings at 9-3 and 17-9 overall. A barrage of scoring late in the first quarter and into the second gave Santa Barbara its early lead. Redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman tallied another double-double with apparent ease as she recorded 12 points and 15 rebounds. It was Edelman's fourht double-double finish in the team's last five games. Fellow redshirt senior point guard Drea Toler joined Edelman with a double-double of her own that featured 10 points and 10 assists. Makala Roper's game-high 15 points combined with Sarah Bates' 11 and Sarah Porter's 12 put the game out of reach for Irvine. In the first quarter, both teams got into foul trouble early, as Bates picked up two fouls and Irvine's star junior guard Morgan Green got called for her third foul around the five minute mark. An odd display of foul calls paired with back and forth scoring resulted in Santa Barbara and Irvine being tied at 12 following a jumper by Roper with 3:10 remaining in the quarter. A minute later, Irvine took the lead via freshman forward Jordan Sanders' mid-range jumper. Unfortunately for Irvine, Sanders' shot would be the Anteaters' last field goal until 4:22 remained in the second quarter. Down 14-12, the Gauchos flipped the script on Irvine in a huge way. Sophomore guard Aliceah Hernandez sunk a three to start the scoring-frenzy for Santa Barbara, which featured two more threes from Roper, an Edelman layup and a Tal Sahar buzzer-beating corner three to close out the quarter up 26-15. UCSB started the second quarter on a 9-0 run as part of its 23-1 run carried over from the end of the first. Edelman scored six-straight herself and another Sahar three-ball made it 35-15 in favor of the Gauchos. Down 20, Irvine finally got a shot to fall junior guard when Andee Ritter knocked down a jumper. The Anteaters made just 3 of their 13 shot attempts in the quarter but avoided the 20-point deficit at halftime, as they trailed 40-24. Irvine's struggle to scoring nine points in the quarter was due much credit to UCSB's defensive prowess during the game as the Anteaters had reached triple digits in scoring twice in their last three games. After sitting out for the entirety of the second quarter with two fouls, Bates knocked down a three to start the second half and followed it up with a jumper for five-straight points. The freshman guard Bates continues to impress this season, as she scored 7 of her 12 points in the third to maintain the Gauchos comfortable lead. Haleigh Talbert knocked down a jumper for Irvine just over the 6-minute mark and a 9-6 run by Irvine put the Anteaters within 18 to start the fourth. The final quarter opened with yet another bucket from beyond the arc via Roper, extending UCSB's lead to 21. Sophomore center Natalia Bruening gave the Gauchos good production off the bench, as she scored five points in the fourth and allowed Henrickson to rest Edelman when needed. Bruening's layup and then another Roper three-pointer gave UCSB a 24-point lead with still over 8 minutes remaining. A short burst of scoring from Irvine placed the Anteaters within 16 at the 6-minute mark, but their Hack-a-Shaq strategy of fouling Drea Toler everytime she got the ball didn't play out well for them. UCSB made 13-of-22 free throws in the fourth quarter to secure the win down the stretch. Toler herself was 8-14 from the line and had 10 points as part of UCSB's 29-point quarter. Despite managing a 20-point quarter as a team, Irvine simply couldn't catch up to the hot-handed Gauchos, falling 82-55. Morgan Green, who came into the game averaging 24.5 points per game, got locked down by UCSB. The Gauchos switched on screens to contain Green and forced her into 9 turnovers on 0-8 shooting from three. ""úMorgan Green, who's so explosive and such a good one-on-one player, obviously between Drea and [Akilah Jennings] they did a really good job,""ùHenrickson said.""úWe did a really good job of not fouling her, we were much more disciplined.""ù Green led her team with 13 points on a less-than efficient night finding the net. Irvine shot 29.9 percent from the field and only 10.5 percent from beyond the arc. Santa Barbara outrebounded Irvine 51-37 and outscored the Anteaters in the paint 24-18, but it was UCSB's capitalization off turnovers that separated the two teams. While UCSB committed 22 turnovers, Irvine turned those turnovers into only 13 points whereas the Gauchos converted Irvine's 19 turnovers into 31 points. On a three-game winning streak and tied with Cal Poly for third in the Big West, the Blue-Green rivalry this coming week will have high stakes for each team seeking to make a run in the standings as conference play nears its end.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's tennis team rebounded from last week's loss with a 7-0 victory over the University of San Francisco and a 5-2 victory over University of Pacific over the weekend. Santa Barbara now sits at 5-2 on the season, including a 3-0 home record. USF fell to 2-4 after being handed its third-straight loss. The losing woes continued for Pacific too, as the Tigers lost their fifth consecutive match and are 1-8. Despite dropping the doubles match on court one, the Gauchos were able to secure the doubles point when senior Simon Freund and freshman Joey Rotheram defeated their opponents 6-2 on court two, giving Santa Barbara some much needed momentum heading into singles play. ""úI love the fact that we feel like we can win on every doubles court this year,""ù Freund said. ""úLast year we were dominant on doubles courts one and two, but three was always up in the air. I'm really glad court three stepped up today and got us the first doubles win.""ù In singles, it was freshman Henrik Atlevi who secured his first ever match victory for the Gauchos after a last second substitution for Rotheram on court six due to injury. Sophomore transfer Joseph Guillin then handled his opponent in two sets on court four, 6-4, 6-3, to give UCSB a comfortable 3-0 lead. But USF continued to battle. On court one, junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran took the first set, 6-1, but fell behind early in the second set. After finding himself behind 4-3 in the set, Moreno de Alboran used his strong serve to catapult him into the lead. He was able to tie the match at five, and ultimately won the set 7-5 to give the Gauchos the victory over USF. ""úWe know a team like this will never go away,""ù Freund said. ""úI'm really glad we kept fighting and kept going.""ù Even after UCSB clinched the match, it was able to get confidence-boosting victories on the remaining courts. On court three, after struggling in doubles and dropping the first set, junior Anders Holm bounced back to take the last two sets. And on court two, Freund also came back from a 1-0 set deficit to get a key personal victory. ""úThat was a very important victory for me personally because I've been struggling a little bit and I really needed to get a good win on the board,""ù Freund said. In their victory Sunday over UOP, the Gauchos started off quickly once again behind improved play from court one tandem Holm and Moreno de Alboran. Despite their saturday loss, the duo combined to defeat the number 24 doubles team in the nation, senior Bernardo Oliviera and sophomore Akram El Sallaly. ""úI think yesterday we focused too much on the [other team] rather than us,""ù Moreno de Alboran said. ""úToday we just wanted to play the tennis we like to play, and even though we went a break down early we didn't let it affect us.""ù Just like on Saturday, court six put the Gauchos up in front 1-0; this time, however, it was Rotheram who did the job, finishing off his opponent in consecutive sets. Freund then followed his victory yesterday on court two with a dominant victory in straight sets as well, putting UCSB up 3-0, meaning the team needed only one more point to secure back-to-back victories. On court one, Moreno de Alboran jumped out to a quick one set advantage, but struggled at the beginning of the second set. Then, Moreno de Alboran started to lean on his dominant forehand shot. With every mammoth return with the forehand, the crowd would cheer in glee. Finally, Moreno de Alboran was able to yell out a victorious ""úVamos""ù when he won the second set, 6-4. ""úI feel like the forehand is definitely my best shot,""ù Moreno de Alboran said. †""úWhen I have time with it, I can hit it big ""¶ my coach always tells me to look for it.""ù UCSB will be back in action soon as it will head to Albuquerque this weekend to take on the University of Utah on Saturday and the University of New Mexico on Sunday.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus The UCSB women's tennis team had a challenging weekend in the Bay Area after a much needed weekend off. The Gauchos finished the weekend without a single win, losing 4-0 to Saint Mary's and 5-2 to Cal. Going into Friday's matchup against St. Mary's, things appeared to slightly favor the now 3-6 Gauchos. However, the results from the match proved the opposite to be true. Despite an increased amount of focus on doubles play by Head Coach Simon Thibodeau and his players, the Gauchos were unable to contend with the Gaels in the fight for the doubles point. The Gauchos' star doubles pairing of seniors Palina Duvabets and Natalie Da Silveira were unable to compete with the Gaels No. 51 tandem of freshmen Hind Abdelouahid and Mariia Kozyreva, and ended up losing the game 6-0. The Gaels duo of junior Clementine Clement and freshman Aubane Ville followed with another doubles victory against the Gauchos' duo of senior Amanda Atanasson and freshman Lise Sentenac, which secured the doubles point for the Gaels. Singles play proved to be slightly more competitive, with the Gauchos securing four set victories against the Gaels on the afternoon. While they were shutout in three consecutive singles games, the Gauchos left some of their more contentious games unfinished. The games between Duvabets and Kozyreva, and Clement and Atanasson were both tied at one set victory a piece at the conclusion of the match, and the Gauchos might have avoided a complete shutout had the games been played out. Following a tough loss to Saint Mary's on Saturday, the Gauchos faced another challenging opponent on Sunday in No. 15 Cal. The Gauchos clearly had their hands full with the Bears. Still, Sunday's match wound up being much more competitive than their previous match, with a final score of 5-2. The Gauchos got off to a good start in doubles play, with the senior duo of Duvabets and Da Silveira defeating the Bears' tandem of freshmen Anna Bright and Julia Rosenqvist, 6-3. Things quickly turned on the Gauchos, however, who lost their following two doubles games to the Bears, leading to them trailing 1-0. Things heated up in singles play, where the Gauchos tied the match with a dominant early victory from Sentenac, who won both her sets against Cal senior Audrey Mayer, 6-2 and 6-0. Cal's No. 33 Olivia Hauger responded with a dominant win of her own, routing UCSB's Da Silveira 6-2 in two back-to-back sets. The Gauchos were able to tie the match again with another victory from sophomore Amit Lev Ari. But the win wouldn't last long as it ended up being the Gauchos last win of the afternoon. Following a promising 2-2 break for the Gauchos, the Bears took over in singles play, winning three consecutive games and securing a 5-2 victory. The Gauchos put up much more of a fight against the Bears, who are one of many formidable ranked opponents that they have faced this year. Despite tough efforts by the Gauchos' players, the team still remains 0-4 against ranked teams on the season. The struggles in doubles play continued during UCSB's weekend in the Bay Area, where the Gauchos lost their second and third consecutive doubles points against Saint Mary's and Cal. While doubles play seemed to be one of Coach Thibodeau's main focuses during his team's time off, it appears that the Gauchos still have a lot of work to do when it comes to gaining an early lead against opponents. After a challenging weekend on the road, the Gauchos will return home this Saturday for a doubleheader against UC Davis and UC Riverside, in what will be their first Big West matchups of the year.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The Blue-Green Rivalry ignites once again as the Gauchos' women's basketball team is set to duel the Cal Poly Mustangs tomorrow in San Luis Obispo. Santa Barbara is hot coming off a big 82-55 victory against UC Irvine. In that game, redshirt senior forward Drew Edelman was back on her double-double grind for UCSB, knocking down 12 points and grabbing 15 rebounds. This was her fourth double-double in the last five games. Her awesome performance last week against UCI and CSUF did not go unnoticed as Edelman earned her second career Big West Player of the Week honors on Monday. She averaged 16 points and 11.5 rebounds in her two games last week. However, Edelman wasn't alone in achieving a double-double against UCI, as redshirt senior Drea Toler also managed to earn a double-double. Dishing out 10 dimes and scoring a commanding 10 points, Toler was on fire. Following the win, the Gauchos are currently 11-14 overall and 8-5 in the Big West. They are also winners of three straight games. The outcome of the game places UCSB one game closer to second-seeded UC Irvine in the standings. As it stands now, Santa Barbara is in third place in the Big West, tied with Cal Poly, their next opponent. This upcoming game has serious conference contentions, as it gives either team the opportunity to be the lone third seed and to inch closer to the two-seed spot. The Mustangs will be hosting Santa Barbara as they come off a loss from Cal State Northridge, where they fell 86-66, but not from a lack of effort. There are some dangerous players on the Mustangs, and UCSB will need to be on high alert for their balanced attack. Senior guard Dynn Leaupepe scored a monster 29 points in the last game for Cal Poly and averages 25.5 points per game during conference play on 46 percent shooting. Her offensive approach is a potent one and is something the Gauchos will have to guard against if they want to contain their opponent. Another player to watch out for is senior guard Lynn Leaupepe. Grabbing seven rebounds in the last game versus Cal State Northridge, L. Leaupepe has over 30 offensive rebounds and 50 defensive rebounds in recent conference games, averaging six rebounds per game. Boxing out and grabbing boards is going to have a major impact on Cal Poly's game versus USCB, so it will be interesting to see how the Gauchos match Cal Poly's intensity under the basket. In their last game, Cal Poly shot 41.2 percent from the field on 28-for-68 shooting. Their offense fell flat in the third quarter, which is where CSUN began to run away. If the Mustangs keep their foot on the gas with their normal scoring attack, they will be a tough opponent to beat. Averaging 65 points per game on 40.6 percent shooting, the Gauchos will face a worthy opponent in the Mustangs, who average 70 points per game on 39.8 percent shooting. Two equally matched opponents with a lot to play for. Look out for the bench play on both teams. Santa Barbara usually has a superior bench in comparison to their opponents, their reserves often making worthy contributions to the game. Not to be dismissed, though, is the bench play of Cal Poly. The home team also has a great bench, which was evident in their last bout, where the reserves put 37 points on the board. Both benches match up nicely, and their head-to-head battle will be a big influence on the outcome of the game. This will be a Blue-Green Rivalry game to remember, as both teams have serious consquences on the line. Santa Barbara will take on Cal Poly at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 21, at the Robert A. Mott Athletics Center.

The Gauchos will host back-to-back home games as familiar opponent Pepperdine will visit this Wednesday. Then on Friday, UCSB and UC San Diego will make history by playing the first Big West Conference match since the Big West sponsored men's volleyball in 2018. Following its recent rut of conceding three of its past four games, Santa Barbara currently stands at 4-4 overall on the year. For the moment, this has them in last place of the Big West ""òAll-Games' league table. Expectations still remain exuberantly high for this squad as they continue to find themselves in national rankings; they are currently No. 13 in the NCAA's AVCA Div 1-2 Coaches' poll, a two spot increase since the beginning of this season. As for their opponents this week, No. 10 Pepperdine boasts a 7-3 overall record and are also sporting a three-game win streak. Unranked UC San Diego is 8-6 on the year, and before their most recent win against Lindenwood, they were managing a four-game losing streak. Pepperdine and UCSB already played once this season, which resulted in a 3-1 road victory for the Gauchos. Meanwhile, this will be Santa Barbara's first meeting with UC San Diego, as both teams are set to play in the first conference matchup in league history. Junior outside hitter David Wieczorek now leads his team in the kills stat over fellow senior outside hitter Colby Harriman; Wieczorek holds a kill total of 113 with a per set ratio of 4.04, whereas Harriman has a 110 kill total and a per set ratio of 2.89. If including their third-place teammate, senior outside hitter Alex Harthaller, this dynamic trio account for a whopping grand total of 326 kills for Pepperdine. Their impressive freshman setter Robert Mullahey still remains in the fold as Pepperdine's primary playmaker with a total of 409 assists on the year. For UC San Diego, there is only one clear-cut offensive mind as their kill stat leader, senior opposite Tanner Syftestad, holds an immense total of 262 and a 5.04 per set ratio. At 6'8""ù and 215 lbs, Syftestad also occasionally doubles as a setter for his side. His kill total and per-set ratio stats are also league-leading as he finds himself in the respective first spots in Big West rankings. Paired with the setting talents of senior setter Milosh Stojcic, who leads his team with 542 assists, UCSB will have to plan for an opposing strategy that will surely focus on Stojcic frequently feeding the ball to Syftestad. While UCSB will be facing top talent this week, it boasts some great talent as well. Junior outside hitter Corey Chavers became the fourth Gaucho to record 24 kills since 2009 when he tallied 24 against Pepperdine in their first meeting. †That performance went on to earn him player of the week honors. Overall, Chavers has been solid for the ""òChos, averaging 3.78 kills per set, which ranks fifth in the conference and 13th in the nation among qualified players. All-time, UCSB has compiled just a 39-68 overall mark against the Waves but will look to continue to improve upon that overall following their previous win. Against the Tritons, the Gauchos have defeated their new Big West foes 38 times of their 46 total meetings, including their wins in the last 10 matchups between the two squads. The Gauchos will host Pepperdine this Wednesday, Feb. 21, at 7 p.m. They will also host the Friday, Feb. 23, conference matchup against UC San Diego, also at 7 p.m.

""úWhy would NFL fans collectively rejoice over this result?""ù you may ask. Well, with all due respect to the great New England franchise, everyone is sick and tired of seeing you guys win! What? With the G.O.A.T Tom Brady and the one-of-a-kind Bill Belichick on your side, the Super Bowl was starting to look like an annual Patriots invitational. At this point, most people would want to see some change at the pinnacle of professional football, and that change was none other than the Philadelphia Eagles. Now that I've gotten all formalities out of the way ""¶ Holy cow the Eagles finally won the Super Bowl! Considering the overall magnitude of the team and all the years that rolled by, fans of Philadelphia craved that Vince Lombardi trophy more and more ever since the first inaugural Super Bowl back in 1967. Factor in two previous runner-up appearances (third time's the charm), including a phenomenal 2017-18 season, and then you got the Eagles' faithful talking about this being their year. Oh, how right they were. Before I get into the Super Bowl itself and how ""òpundits' alike were counting out the Eagles all year long, I'm going to mention a few key moments from both regular and postseason play that stood out that ultimately led up to the completion of the Philadelphia dream as well as football's greatest underdog tale. The Field Goal Heard Around the World What a start to the season this was. Carson Wentz had begun to show signs of major second-year progression, the Eagles had seemingly found a No. 1 wide receiver in Alshon Jeffery and that four-headed monster of a defensive line had only just begun its rampage on opposing quarterbacks. It was a Week Three divisional matchup at home for the Eagles when the New York Giants came knocking on Philadelphia's door. Thrust early on into desperation mode after conceding the first two matches of the new season, the Giants sought to upset the Eagles in their own backyard and spoil the festivities of what looked to be the start of a promising year. It was a back and forth game throughout, but in the final minute of the fourth quarter, the game was tied at 24-24. The Eagles had moved up the field minimally but still had time to get into field goal range before the clock expired. On a right side curl route, Wentz found Jeffery for a 27-yard gain who then stepped out of bounds with one second remaining. Enter rookie kicker Jake Elliott, who landed the field goal from a franchise record of 61-yards out, earning the Eagles their second win of the season in very memorable fashion. A Primetime Performance With both teams at a 4-1 overall record, many analysts had the Eagles and Panthers battling for a top-three slot in the weekly power rankings. Luckily, the two teams would go on and face off in a primetime Thursday Night Football matchup. This away game would prove to be the hardest meeting for the Eagles this far into the season. With Cam Newton on the rise once more, Philadelphia was the only thing standing in Carolina's way. The match was a hard-fought and close affair as both sides swapped leads several times. Ultimately, the game came down to stamina as the Eagles' defensive line completely halted the opposing run game, thus forcing Newton to overthrow and exhaust himself, resulting in a pair of late interceptions that halted all hope for a comeback. The Eagles had done it again in the clutch, proving that they were definitely a team to keep an eye on. Wentz in a Lifetime In the following week, the Eagles would go on to host a divisional Monday Night Football game for the ages against the Redskins. More specifically, Carson Wentz would go on and shred Washington in the air for 268 yards and four touchdowns. This standout game for Wentz would prove to be the platform for his potential MVP candidacy. Putting on a show all season long, he once again achieved some unbelievable feats by escaping collapsing pockets and making almost impossible throws all across the field. Truly, this was the start of something special for the Eagles' organization and its fans, as talks of a deep playoff run were brewing. Star Foles: A New Hope Rams versus Eagles, Goff versus Wentz: a great battle in the NFC as well as the NFL Game of the Week at the famous Coliseum. At this point in the season, Philadelphia was at the top of the league standings and was just one win away from clinching the NFC East Division title. It was perhaps the most thrilling matchup yet ""î or perhaps I'm just biased because I saw it all go down live in person ""î as both sides just couldn't stop scoring. Then, tragedy: Wentz goes down with an ACL tear after diving into the end zone in order to hand his team the lead. As Philly fans held their breath, they looked to backup quarterback Nick Foles to save the day. He'd go on to do more than just that, as we all know. Thus, the start of the Foles era began in the midst of a potentially abrupt end to the season and minute hope for what he could possibly achieve in the playoffs. ""úThey're the Best Defense in the League; You Can't Win!""ù Thirty-eight total points, that was just how much the Eagles dropped on what pundits proclaimed as, ""òthe best defense in the NFL.' The Vikings visited Lincoln Financial Field in hopes of earning a one-way ticket to the Super Bowl, which would be held in Minnesota regardless ""î that is, unless Foles and the Eagles had something to say about it. Starting with a pick-six by veteran cornerback Patrick Robinson, the floodgates were opened in Philly as the scores began to rain down on the opposing defense. Running backs LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi ground pounded, tight end Zach Ertz caught on third down to move the chains and Foles flung it into the end zone from deep ""¶ The Eagles had done it. They had finally earned their chance to return to the Super Bowl, this time in hopes of exacting revenge upon a familiar enemy. Super Bowl LII: Eagles 41 ""ì Patriots 33 The previous section's subheader was a critic's quote for a reason. I can't even begin to tell you the number of Eagles nonbelievers that were present in both national coverage and local media. You would think after all the counting out going on during the season and through the playoffs that the dialogue would change from ""úyou can't""ù to ""úmaybe you can.""ù Inevitably, the Eagles went on and achieved as the underdogs once more. It was Brady, the G.O.A.T., versus Foles, the hope. Early on the Eagles took and maintained the lead. Following a pair of field goals on each side, a deep throw from Foles found its way into Jeffery's control as he made a spectacular catch that resulted into a 34-yard touchdown. With a score of 9-3 early in the 2nd quarter, the Patriots would go on to travel all the way down the field until eventually missing on a muffed field goal attempt. The Eagles would go on and take advantage of Patriots turnovers on downs and hand the ball to Blount for a 21-yard rushing touchdown and extend their lead to 15-3. New England would soon respond after with a made long field goal, interception near the end zone, and a James White rushing touchdown with no extra point after. Halftime was on the horizon, but second year head coach Doug Pederson had something special planned for the Patriots on 4th and Goal; the ""úPhilly Special""ù that is. The ""úPhilly Special""ù play will go down in the Super Bowl history books as one of the best trick plays ever accomplished. This formation featured Foles ushering over to the shotgun position as yelled at his offensive line in order to distract New England's defense. The ball was then abruptly snapped to halfback Corey Clement who ran left until he lateral passed possession to tight end Trey Burton. All the meanwhile Foles had sneakily walked unmarked into the right side of the goal line, then catching the easy touchdown pass from Burton. I'll be honest, I screamed at the top of my lungs when I saw this entire maneuver get pulled off on the big screen in real-time. As the halftime whistle was blown, the Eagles entered the locker room with a lead of 22-12 and were just two full quarters away from the franchise's biggest victory ever. Entering the third, Brady had a point to prove, likely relating to his moniker of ""òthe Comeback Kid.' He ended the first possession of the new half with a darting touchdown pass to his favorite target in tight end Rob Gronkowski, bringing the score to 19-22. Foles then responded on the following drive with a touchdown pass of his own to Clement and expanded the Eagles' lead once more to 29-19, but it was still a game that could burst wide open at any second. Then, as if the current trend was a surprise to anyone, Brady brought it back to within a score by way of touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Hogan. The 4th quarter whistle would then bring the game to its most crucial point as time appeared to slow down entirely in this for the most part fast paced game. The Eagles started the last quarter of the match with a long field goal kick courtesy of Elliott, Philadelphia lead 32-26. On the next drive, Brady knew a touchdown would be enough to earn the Patriots the lead and shift the momentum in his side's favor. Considering this game broke the record for most offensive yards in a Super Bowl back in the 3rd quarter, this possession was no different as Brady had his team travel down the field as he once again delivered a touchdown pass to Gronkowski. Down for the first time since the field goal exchange in the first quarter, Foles and the Eagles needed one last feat of skillful endurance as the clock wound down with the score still at 32-33.
Clutch player spoiler, here comes Zach Ertz. Following a pair of first-down catches made by Ertz himself, the star tight end went on to catch the game-winning score that put Philadelphia up 38-33 late in the game. The two-point conversion failed but that didn't matter because it was still all hands on deck regardless if the Eagles defense had any chance of stopping Brady and his bunch. Then, the greatest defensive play in Eagles history occurred right before everyone's eyes. ""úBrady gets hit, the ball is out!""ù yelled play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan as Philadelphia defensive end Brandon Graham strips possession away from the New England quarterback's grasp. The ball ended up getting recovered by Eagles first-round drafted rookie Derek Barnett and his side was now in prime position to run out the clock and earn their first ever Super Bowl. Goosebumps ran rampant on both sides' fans as each hoped for the best. Ultimately the Patriots would go on to hold the Eagles to only a field goal, but used up all their timeouts in the process. With the score at 41-33 and the clock within the final minute of play, the Eagles just needed a single defensive stop on downs. Playing deep in their own secondary, the Eagles only allowed Brady to get into a Hail Mary passing range as the whole nation held its breath for the last play of Super Bowl 52. They had done it. It was over. The Eagles had won. The final play resulted in that Hail Mary pass and the obvious target of Gronkowski's huge frame was covered by six different Eagles cornerbacks. As the failed ball fell on the ground, so did all the green confetti. It was a night to remember for a new dynasty, and a night to forget for the old dynasty. We can all now breathe a sigh of relief Eagles fans; we made it into the circle of champions. Hopes were high for this glorious match and hopes will remain high as our team's future remains bright with the help of both Wentz and Foles, the young and experienced star core on both offense and defense, as well as the coaching and administrative talents involved with the Eagles organization. Now as the offseason approaches and we let this win sink in, all I have to say is one last thing""¶ Go Birds.

sports,An Exciting Time: Hosmer Joins San Diego Padres,22-Feb-18,5:09 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/an-exciting-time-hosmer-joins-san-diego-padres/,"Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus As a San Diego Padres fan, I'm excited for the start of the Major League Baseball season. No, that was not a typo. For the first time in my recent memory, following the Padres acquisition of All-Star first baseman Eric Hosmer, I am legitimately, unequivocally excited for the season to start. I can't remember the last time I felt like this. Going into the 2015 season, I had a tempered form of excitement, but it was more the excitement you feel when you get the new iPhone you wanted three years prior, only to find out that they've made about 15 new models in the meantime. I was pumped to finally have people with name recognition on the team, but I wouldn't really call a well-past-his-prime Matt Kemp, an ever-inconsistent Justin Upton and a James Shields that had more mileage on his arm than my ""ò03 Highlander a reason for true, genuine excitement. Even before that, when the Padres were perennial NL West champions, I didn't feel this energy, this searing excitement at the sheer thought of baseball season. Those teams were solid, don't get me wrong. With Jake Peavy at the front of our rotation and newly-minted hall-of-famer Trevor Hoffman at the back end, our dependable pitching always kept us in games. But despite all of their success, there was never a feeling we were truly competing for a title. In reality, we were lucky when we didn't get swept in the first round of the playoffs ""ì a yearly occurrence for a team that lacked any semblance of a threatening lineup. But when I got that notification on my phone in bold letters, ""úHosmer decides to sign with Padres,""ù everything changed. San Diego has never, in my entire lifetime, signed an all-star in the midst of his prime ""ì that is, until now. Hosmer is only 28 and is coming off a career season in which he hit .318 with 25 homers at the plate. Two seasons ago, this man was named the All-Star Game MVP at Petco Park, proving that perhaps he can overcome the mental mistakes of hitters in the past and actually have success hitting at Petco. As a lefty, those odds are even more likely. The city needed this. It was about a year ago that Dean Spanos screwed over an entire city of loyal fans by moving the Chargers. San Diego State Basketball hasn't been up to par since Steve Fisher retired ""ì even before that, if we're being honest. We need a team to get behind, to energize the fan base, to get ""úAmerica's Finest City""ù excited about something again. I'm not quixotic enough to really believe that signing Hosmer will automatically catapult us into the title conversation; in fact, I'm not even sure it makes us a playoff team this year. Putting Hosmer at first pushes Wil Myers to the outfield, a position that he once said he ""úgets bored playing.""ù Myers gladly signed on to the move, but by no means is he a Gold Glover out there.
In addition, our rotation is still a mess, to put it mildly. Half of our rotation is probably closer to being in a retirement home than an adequate major league starter. I mean, Chris Young was a good starter for the Padres ""¶ in 2006. If Kemp was the old iPhone model, then Young is an iPod Touch Generation Two. With that being said, it supports my notion that the Padres lack an ideal major league rotation. Pundits have been all too kind in pointing this out, questioning the fit and the Padres decision to dole out over $140 million to a player who has been inconsistent at times throughout his career. But Hosmer has two things that his stats can't account for: leadership and experience. He's been to the World Series with the Royals. According to Ken Rosenthal, reviews have been ""úglowing""ù on Hosmer's clubhouse presence. He can provide invaluable insight for a young rebuilding roster that boasts one of the best farm systems in the majors. And because of his age, he still fits in the Padres' long-term plans. The goal the entire time was to ""úcompete""ù in 2019; at that point, Hosmer will still only be 29. Plus, the deal is front-loaded to allow the Padres to get rid of him after five years with a much lesser salary hit. Most importantly, we have a reason to celebrate, to see the clear vision of the front office and to applaud them for finally being willing to spend money. We have a reason to cheer again. Just like every year in the recent past, I'll be attending opening day with my dad. This time, however, I will do so with renewed hope. This time, I will do so with the belief that we are on the cusp of finally bringing a title back to the city I hold so dear.

sports,Gauchos Hope to Earn Quality Road Wins Versus No. 40 Utah & No. 48 New Mexico,22-Feb-18,5:05 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/gauchos-hope-to-earn-quality-road-wins-versus-no-40-utah-no-48-new-mexico/,"Simon Freund serves to his opponent. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following back-to-back wins this past weekend, the UCSB men's tennis team will travel to Albuquerque to take on the University of Utah on Saturday, followed by the University of New Mexico on Sunday. The Gauchos bounced back from their loss against USD two weeks ago with a 7-0 dismantling of USF on Saturday. Perhaps more important than the victory itself was the confidence it instilled in the team; senior Simon Freund cited his victory as ""úa much needed win.""ù In that victory, the Gauchos once again proved their depth when Freshman Henrik Atlevi, who subbed in just before the start of singles, put Santa Barbara ahead 1-0 with his first ever victory in a Gaucho uniform. In their 5-2 victory over Pacific, the court one doubles pairing of Juniors Nicolas Moreno De Alboran and Anders Holm got a much needed victory over the 24th-ranked doubles pairing in the nation. The entire team will have to carry that confidence into their match on Saturday when they take on a red hot Utes team that has won seven matches in a row, coming into their matchup against the Gauchos with an overall 12-1 record. However, the Utes have failed to secure any marquee victories this season, the closest semblance to one being their 4-3 victory over Utah State, who is 7-3 on the season. While they lack key victories, however, Utah also lacks any bad losses ""î their only loss of the season came on the road against Harvard, a historically powerhouse school who currently sits at 9-2. ""úThe upcoming matches will be very challenging as we'll be trying to adjust to playing indoors at 5,300 feet of altitude,""ù Head Coach Marty Davis said. Moreno De Alboran will have his hands full on court one when he likely takes on junior Dan Little for the Utes. Last season, Little took down two ranked opponents, including the No. 41 player in the nation. Moreno De Alboran will have to depend on his dominant forehand if he hopes to avoid the upset. For doubles ""î an area that has often caused the Gauchos trouble this year ""î Utah has the freshman duo of Randy Cory and Russell Benkaim on court one. While young, both ranked in the top ten in doubles in the UTSA rankings and were the only doubles pair to win in the match against Harvard. Much like UCSB, the Utes boast strong depth ""î the only match they won by less than two was the aforementioned match against Utah State. With freshman Viktor Krustev still dealing with an injury, junior Hironori Koyanagi will have to continue to play solid tennis on court five for the Gauchos. Also working in Santa Barbara's favor will be the fatigue factor. On Friday, Utah will have to take on a strong New Mexico team before their matchup with the Gauchos 24 hours later. On Sunday, UCSB will take on that same New Mexico team, who enters the weekend with a 5-3 record. Earlier this year, the Lobos fought the 25th-ranked Texas Tech Red Raiders in Lubbock, only losing by a score of 4-3. That being said, the team has battled inconsistency, as is demonstrated by a loss to a Northern Arizona squad that Utah easily handled. In part, that loss can be attributed to injuries and the spread of the flu, but the loss underscores the lack of depth on a team that only fields eight players total. The Lobos most consistent contributor this season has been Senior Bart Van Leijsen. He has been named All-Mountain West for both singles and doubles the last two seasons, and in his sophomore year won the sixth most doubles matches in New Mexico history. Junior Ricky Hernandez Tong has also led a top-heavy squad this season; as a freshman, his .679 win percentage lead the team. The Lobos will be a difficult matchup for the Gauchos, especially considering that they will have an extra day of rest. UCSB will likely have a tough match against the Utes, and could be playing on tired legs against New Mexico. ""úObviously, winning on the road against two ranked teams would be very helpful [for our ranking],""ù Davis said. The Gauchos will take on Utah on Saturday at 12 p.m., followed by their match against New Mexico on Sunday at 12 p.m. as well.

sports,UCSB Falls 3-2 to Pepperdine in Reverse Fixture at Home,22-Feb-18,11:04 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-22/ucsb-falls-3-2-to-pepperdine-in-reverse-fixture-at-home/,"Nexus File Photo It was a close game throughout it all, but UCSB just couldn't find their rhythm against the visiting side. Ultimately, Pepperdine ousted the home side's comeback and took the fifth and final set. With the final result ending at 2-3 in favor of the Waves, the Gauchos will look to get these errors under wraps and find their form just in time for the start of this new Big West Conference season. Wednesday night started off fairly even on both ends of the court as each time attempted to break free from the tied scores. However, it was Pepperdine's set as the Gauchos always seemed to be either trailing or close to bringing it all even. The deciding point in the match eventually came in the latter half once the Waves found their momentum and a 21-18 lead. At that point the Gauchos couldn't break the separation in points and the set was soon lost by a score of 25-22. By the second set, the Gauchos came out of the break with much more intensity. Thanks to an improvement in performance on the defensive side of the ball, UCSB maintained a cushion of two to three points over Pepperdine for most of the second†set. The Gauchos went on to take this set by a 25-21 final score, as it was 1-all on the night's volleyball meet. The third set proved to be not only the closest but also a crucial one, as both offenses were battling it out at the net. Gaucho junior outside hitter Corey Chavers was the key player in this one as he put up an impressive 8 kill total in this set alone. However, it was not enough as Pepperdine managed to clutch it out and hold off UCSB in the final points of the set; earning them 2-1 on the night by a set score of 26-24. Now in desperation mode, the Gauchos fought back once again and managed to take the game to a fifth set following several errors on the Waves' side. This was also due in part because of a mid set run that allowed enough momentum for UCSB to bolster a 7-point lead, that they ultimately carried through to the end final result of 25-22. Unfortunately, this rollercoaster of a match didn't go as planned for the home side as the Gauchos just couldn't find an answer for Pepperdine's junior outside hitter David Wieczorek, who tallied 5 total kills and led his team to the 15-12 final set win. UCSB were really only able to keep it close in the beginning of this set, but couldn't get the job done; Pepperdine had won this reverse fixture by a dramatic 3-2 win. This Friday marks the first inaugural match of the new Men's Volleyball league sponsored under the Big West Conference. They face UC San Diego and enter with high expectations of potentially challenging the NCAA's No. 1, Long Beach State.

Santa Barbara will attempt to pull off the upset against a 13-1 Bruin squad. The teams met earlier this year on Jan. 21, where the Bruins came away with a 10-6 victory over the Gauchos. UCLA started the season hot beginning with a 12-0 start, but lost its first match of the season against No. 3 USC two weeks ago. The Bruins bounced back with a win against No. 7 UC Irvine but again showed glimpses of a team that could be beat as they only just pulled away from the Anteaters with an 8-7 victory in double overtime. It was their first overtime win of the year. Sophomore attacker Maddie Musselman scored the game winner with 1:42 remaining to stun the Anteaters. She leads UCLA with 24 goals and 16 assists. Despite a solid performance by its cohort of utilities ""ì a scoring hat trick and two assists from junior Kate Pipkin, two goals from junior Sarah Kreiser and a goal from freshman Amelia Meckelborg ""ì UCSB was unable to keep UCLA from finding the back of the net. The 10 goals allowed tied the most given up by UCSB this season. A total of 10 games have taken place since this first meeting with UCLA, and improvements on defense have definitely been made. UCSB has given up just an average of four goals during that 10-match stretch. ""úWe focus on defense,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay said. ""úDefense wins championships, and that's what fuels the counterattack in transition and into the frontcourt. Keeping teams under eight is always our goal.""ù The Gauchos head into this game with a one-game losing streak after a devastating 7-6 loss to Loyola Marymount on Feb. 11. With a 6-6 tie going into the fourth period, the Lions' Katie Hungerford was able to convert on a late goal with three minutes left to seal the victory. The narrow loss snapped a two-game winning streak for the Gauchos, where they scored 20 goals and only gave up nine goals between both games. In order for the Gauchos to come out with a win this Friday, it will be crucial to limit the high-powered Bruin offense. UCSB's sophomore utility Sarah Snyder comes into this game with 30 goals, leading not only the team but also the Big West Conference. ""úSnyder fills the role of not only a center, but she also plays on the perimeter,""ù Kay said. ""úI think that has freed her up a little bit, which has been a very positive thing.""ù Contributing to the scoring process are players like Pipkin, who leads both the Gauchos and Big West with 21 assists and 45 points. ""úPip has a very high game IQ,""ù Kay explained. ""úIt's obvious in her points, leading in assists and then being high up there in goals scored. She plays a huge part on the mental aspect of the game, making sure that she is the glue that keeps everyone together.""ù As the Gauchos approach conference play, they will look to follow the mantra that has led them to their early success thus far this season. ""úWork hard, be resilient and trust the process,""ù Kay said. Santa Barbara will play UCLA at 1:45 p.m. this Friday, Feb. 23, at the Anteater Aquatics Complex in Irvine. UCSB will also compete two more times after their matchup with the Bruins where wins and losses will predict what future teams they'll face during the weekend.

The home side Gauchos were hosting the first conference meet of the new season, as well as the commencement of the new Big West sponsorship in Men's volleyball. There were lead changes and extended sets galore as this game went all the way, ultimately resulting in a spectacular first conference win for UCSB. Santa Barbara is now back to .500 on the season with a 5-5 overall mark and became the conference's first winner. UC San Diego is now 8-7 on the year, 0-1 in the Big West. The Gauchos started this match in fine fettle as they started the night off with a first set victory in which a late set run allowed for UCSB to pull away to the 25-20 final result. Sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders got the night's offensive show rolling as he notched a total of 8 kills in this first set alone. The Tritons fought back in a big way as they kept the score much tighter in the second set. However, the versatility of Gaucho sophomore setter Randy DeWeese, on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball, was too much for San Diego as he led his team to their 2-0 lead on the night by a score of 30-28. The third set also resulted in a 30-28 result, except this time it was in favor of the visiting UC San Diego. Triton senior opposite/setter Tanner Syftestad helped his side to their first set victory of the night and would also go on to earn a team leading 20 total kills by the match's end. San Diego would eventually bring the set score to two-all after a poor fourth set from Santa Barbara. The final score for that one ended at a sub-par 25-16 as the Gauchos never really found their momentum whilst the Tritons seemed to have everything going right their way. This fifth and final set would be the second instance in just two days considering a similar scenario occurred on Wednesday versus Pepperdine, however, that didn't end as planned. Thankfully, stamina was of no concern and the Gauchos found their rhythm once more, even through a nail biting 20-18 win which granted them the overall win and 1-0 record in the Big West standings. ""úWe did a lot of good things, especially early on; we just got a little complacent. San Diego is a really good team, you give them an inch and they're going to jump on it, which they did. It could have gone either way,""ù said head coach Rick McLaughlin. This was a big win for UCSB not just because it was a conference match, but also because it showed it has the resiliency and stamina to hold onto a solid five-set win. ""úWe played a good fifth game, and that's got to be a heartbreaking loss for them [San Diego]; we've been on the other end of that [Wednesday against Pepperdine],""ù McLaughlin said. ""úI think this was because we started to not serve great, they stepped up their game, and you got to give them credit""¶we're still a little bit young in that area where you think you have it in your hand and then all of a sudden the team starts challenging you, we start to do some funny things. We got to stop doing that and hopefully it was a learning experience.""ù Overall, it was a great showing from both teams and a night to remember for each side's fans. Considering the Gauchos recent performances, hopefully this gritty win should ignite UCSB's high expectations on the season once more. ""úBeing in this conference is the best thing for men's volleyball""¶it's awesome what the league is doing for us and I'm glad we put on a great five set show tonight,""ù McLaughlin said. The Gauchos will be on the road next week as they will face off against USC on Thursday, March 1st, at 7PM for a non-conference regular season matchup.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus It was Senior Night in the Thunderdome on Saturday, and the crowd was rocking. Just when the game seemed to be heading for overtime, seconds were put back on the clock, and the UCSB women's basketball team came out with the win. The seniors were all set for sendoff, as small forward Chaya Durr, forward Drew Edleman, guard Makala Roper, and point guard Drea Toler all accepted accolades for their tenure with the UCSB women's basketball team right before their final home game of the regular season. Up against UC Riverside, the Gauchos managed to use a forceful balanced attack to come back and win the game 72-20, within the last few seconds. This win puts Santa Barbara at 12-15 overall, and 9-6 in the Big West ""ì with UC Riverside dropping to 8-20 overall, and 5-9 in conference play. Trailing for most of the game, the Gauchos struggled initially, allowing their opponents to shoot at nearly 50 percent shooting. It was 35-24 at the end of the first half, the visitors having the 11-point advantage over their opponents. Riverside had some monster performances by senior guard Michelle Curry, and redshirt senior guard Lauren Holt. Curry racked up an amazing double-double, scoring a game-high 31 points and 14 rebounds, while Holt had a well-rounded 5 rebounds and 5 assists to go along with her 21-point performance. Edelman had another dominating double-double night, draining a team-high 27 points, and grabbing 14 boards, which was tied with Riverside's Curry for the most in the game. With just under 9 minutes left to play in regulation, UCSB trailed by 11, the score sitting at 53-42 in favor of the road team. The fourth quarter began to heat up for the Gauchos, as Edelman and redshirt sophomore guard Tal Sahar combined for an explosive 25 of the team's 32 points in the last quarter. Despite their valiant effort, though, the home team still trailed by six, the score 68-62 with only 41 seconds left to play. Sahar scored a clutch three-pointer from beyond the arc, and after the opponents scored, Sahar attempted to drain another shot from downtown, but was fouled and knocked down all three free throw attempts, to bring the game to 69-68, UCSB behind by just 1 point. After the Highlanders were fouled and scored just one of their two free throws, redshirt junior guard Sarah Porter passed the ball to Edelman who had a good look and shot the ball in to tie the game up at 70, with just 8 seconds left on the clock. Curry attempted a shot to take the game for UCR, but the shot fell out of bounds, possession then belonging to the home team. It looked as if the Gauchos would be set up to play their first overtime game since the 2014-2015 season, but that turned out to not be the case. While regulation seemingly ended with the score tied up at 70-70, the officials put 1.5 seconds back on the game clock after review. That last second and a half was sufficient enough for the home team to get the walk off win. Toler inbounded the pass to freshman guard Sarah Bates who was fouled and forced to leave the game after being injured on the play. Coming in to complete the play by shooting her free throws, Bates knocked in both attempts, allowing UCSB to win the game without extra OT minutes. It was a special night in the Thunderdome, as the 27 points for Edelman are tied for her career-high, with this being her sixth double-double in the last seven games. Toler had 10 dimes, which is also tied for her career-high in assists, and her second straight home game dishing out double digits assists. Sahar ended the game with a season-high 21 points, and just two points away from her career-high. UCSB shot at 46.3 percent on 25-for-54 shooting, while UCR scored at a slightly higher 49.1 percent on 27-for-55 shooting. Both teams were aggressive offensively, the home team just showing more assertiveness late down the stretch. The Gauchos are geared to play their last game of the regular season on the road against Hawai'i on Thursday, Mar. 1 at 9:00 p.m.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After two games in which they shot a combined 32 percent from the field, the UCSB men's basketball team needed to get their offense back in order. It seems they took a significant step in that direction on Saturday evening against Cal State Northridge. The Gauchos topped the Matadors 82-73 for their first win since in a week and a half, and cracked the 50 percent mark on field goals for the first time in just as long. The win bumped UCSB back up into a tie for first place in the Big West with UC Irvine at 10-4. Saturday night's game was full of positive signs for the Gaucho offense. UCSB went 11-22 from three-point land, their first time shooting over 35 percent from distance since a February 8 victory over UC Davis. In a major departure from their five total assists against UC Irvine on Thursday, the Gauchos racked up 19 assists against CSUN. That's the team's highest total in over a month, and representative of their rejuvenated generosity. Leland King II seemed similarly rejuvenated. The graduate transfer put up 25 points and 12 rebounds while shooting 73 percent from the field and dishing out five assists. That last number is tied for a season-high for King, who turned the ball over just twice. King's strong performance Saturday night was a significant turnaround from his previous two games, in which he scored a combined total of nine points. The 6-7 forward also knocked down his first two three-pointers in the last four games. Point guard Marcus Jackson led all Gauchos with eight assists against just one turnover, as the graduate transfer provided a stable and generous hand at the top of the offense. Guards Gabe Vincent and Max Heidegger particularly benefited from their teammates' generosity. Both guards notched 17 points and knocked down four threes, while putting up balanced stat sheets outside of the point totals. The Gauchos were very starter-heavy, getting only ten points from their bench, but that didn't matter much Saturday night. CSUN took an early 3-2 lead on a Carl Brown three-pointer, but UCSB controlled the game from that point. King had 17 of his 25 points in the first half, and was far and away the most effective player on either team for those first 20 minutes. The Matadors simply had no answer for the graduate transfer, who single-handedly outscored his hosts by a 9-5 margin over a five-minute stretch late in the first half. UCSB took a 39-25 lead into halftime, and managed to expand their advantage to 19 with 16:31 to go in the second. That was as large as their lead would get, but it was more than enough for the Gauchos to close things out. CSUN did put up a tough fight in that second half, outscoring UCSB 48-43 over the last 20 minutes. A Matador run cut the Gaucho lead to just five with 6:50 to go, but that was as close as Northridge would get to pulling off the comeback. Slowly but surely, the Gauchos pulled away down the stretch. A pair of three-pointers, the first from Jackson and the second from Vincent, pushed the UCSB lead back up to ten, and a broad offensive effort from the starters ensured that things never got much closer than that. CSUN's Tavrion Dawson had perhaps the most balanced stat sheet of the night with 22 points, eight rebonds and six assists. Dawson was the primary offensive engine behind the Matadors' late-game gasp, as the 6-8 senior forward poured in 16 points in just the second half alone. While Saturday's game was a real reversal of the Gauchos' prior offensive woes, it was by no means a guarantee of similar things to come. For that, UCSB will have to put up points against a team that isn't sitting at the bottom of the Big West standings. The Gauchos will have that chance next week when they take on Long Beach State, just before they try to avenge their heartbreaking last-second loss to Cal Poly way back at the beginning of conference play.

sports,UCSB Splits Weekend at UCI Invite,25-Feb-18,10:48 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-02-25/ucsb-splits-weekend-at-uci-invite/,"Nexus File Photo The No. 17 ranked UCSB women's water polo team, who now stand at 10-8 overall, played a total of four matches throughout the weekend at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational in Irvine. The tournament consisted of 16 of the top 20 teams in the country, nine of them being in the top 10. The Gauchos started off with a rematch with the No. 4 UCLA Bruins, who they had played earlier this year in a 10-6 defeat in Santa Barbara. From the start, the Bruins seized control of the game with a 4-0 run to open up the first period. Despite the large lead, the Gauchos started to find their rhythm in the second period with goals from sophomore attacker Natalie Selin and sophomore utility Kate Coski to cut the deficit to 4-2. This was the closest the Gauchos came to the Bruins as they went on a 7-0 run to seemingly put the game out of reach making the score 11-2 at the time. UCLA won the game with a final score of 13-3 with the 13 points being the most goals the Gauchos have given up this season. Sophomore attacker Maddie Musselman led the way for the Bruins with three goals. Despite the loss on Friday, the Gauchos still had a chance to make their way into winning bracket if they were able to win both the games they played in on Saturday. However, UCSB ended up splitting the day with two thrillers against San Diego State and Michigan, both teams they had played and lost too earlier this year as well. The Gauchos were able to edge out San Diego State with a 5-4 victory. Sophomore phenom Sarah Snyder scored an early goal but the hero of the game was Selin, who scored two goals in the final period, including the game winner with a little over 1:30 left, to seal the win. The Aztecs were led by GCC player of the week Emily Bennett, however, the freshman utility only mustered one goal the entire match. It took a tremendous defensive effort by the Gauchos to hold San Diego State to just four goals as they average ten goals per game on the season. UCSB played in yet another close game against the Michigan Wolverines later that afternoon. The teams had met previously this year with the Wolverines winning by a score of 10-7. The Gauchos led 4-3 early in the final period but the Wolverines would go on a 4-0 run to help put the game out of reach. The final score of the game made the score 7-5, with junior Kate Pipkin scoring a late goal with four seconds left. Pipkin led the team with three goals while sophomore attacker Sarah Snyder and junior utility Sarah Kreiser scored a goal each. Santa Barbara would finish the tournament with a morning game on Sunday where they faced Loyola Marymount University. The two teams had met previously this year in a nail biter where the Lions escaped with a 7-6 victory. Despite a quick start out of the gates from the Gauchos with two early goals from Selin and freshman attacker Mollie Simmons, LMU went on a 4-0 run between the end of the first period to the end of the third period. Snyder was able to find the back of the net with a little over three minutes left to make it a one goal game but the team was unable to complete the comeback with such little time remaining. LMU won the close match 4-3 and was†led by Morgan Molloy who scored two goals and eight key saves from goalkeeper Claire Wright. UCSB will look to get back on track as they play two games against Redlands and Pomona-Pitzer at the Claremont Convergence Tournament on Saturday, March 3rd.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following a 4-3 loss to SMU on Tuesday, the UCSB women's tennis team will travel to Arizona on Friday to face the University of Arizona, followed by No. 33 Arizona State on Saturday. The Gauchos, who are 5-7 overall, are coming off of a missed chance to extend their win streak to three consecutive matches for the first time this season. The final score was not indicative of how intense the match actually was, as UCSB trailed the Mustangs for most of the match and opted to play its remaining matches out on each court after SMU secured the match point at 4-1. Tuesday's loss was a disappointing one for the Gauchos, who fell just one match short of sweeping their most recent three-match stint at home. The Gauchos will not have much time to rest and recover, as they will have to face yet another challenging opponent, Arizona, on Friday. The Wildcats are currently unranked on the season, but have experienced a solid 7-4 season despite having a schedule dotted with a number of top ranked opponents. Unlike UCSB, Arizona has had nearly a whole week of rest after falling 7-0 to No. 39 NC State on Saturday and is motivated to break out of its most recent two-game losing streak which began with a 4-0 loss to No. 8 Texas Tech last Friday. Friday's match is shaping up to be quite the uphill battle for the Gauchos. The weekend will not get much easier for the Gauchos, who will face No. 33 Arizona State the next day. The 5-3 Sun Devils have had an impressive season, with only three narrow losses to top ranked teams in No. 19 Oklahoma State, No. 15 Kentucky and No. 11 Ohio State. ASU is coming off a nail-biting 4-3 road loss to No. 11 Ohio State on Sunday and will likely put up a serious fight against UCSB. Arizona State's roster features two nationally ranked singles players with No. 84 freshman Lauryn John-Baptiste and No. 107 sophomore Savannah Slaysman. John-Baptiste has been dominant this season, dropping just one loss in singles play to Oklahoma State, leaving her with a personal record of 5-1. UCSB's doubles battle against ASU will likely be its most difficult test of the weekend, as the Sun Devils' roster also features two nationally ranked doubles pairings. The Sun Devils' No. 27 ranked tandem of Slaysman and freshman Tereza Kolarova, and No. 46 tandem of seniors Kelley Anderson and Nicole Fossa Huergo have dominated opponents this season and will look to do the same against UCSB. Doubles play has been one of the Gauchos' more prominent struggles this season, who at one point dropped three doubles points in a row to opponents. Despite lacking consistency in doubles play overall, UCSB has experienced exemplary play by its No. 57 ranked duo of seniors Natalie Da Silveira and Palina Duvabets, who are currently on a three game winning streak in doubles play. The Gauchos' tandem of Da Silveira and Duvabets are not unaccustomed to upsets, after having defeated No. 44 Cal's No. 1 doubles pairing on Feb. 18. While Arizona State appears to be one of the Gauchos' biggest threats in doubles play this season, fans can certainly expect strong play from their duo of seniors, with the possibility of a major upset. This weekend will prove to be quite tough for the 5-7 Gauchos, who have experienced a recent onslaught of matches without much rest in between. However, the prospect of toppling challenging foes continues to be a motivating factor for UCSB, which has yet to secure a victory in any of its ranked matchups this season. The Gauchos will face Arizona on Friday, Feb. 2, at the Robson Tennis Center in Tucson, Arizona. Santa Barbara's match against Arizona State is scheduled to take place the day after on Saturday, Feb. 3, at the Whiteman Tennis Center in Tempe, Ariz.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following a packed Gaucho Classic that resulted in two wins and two losses, the UCSB softball team fell below the .500 mark.†Santa Barbara will hope to surpass an even record as it will travel this upcoming weekend to Kissimmee, Florida, to compete in a five-game stretch for the 2018 Citrus Classic II. It's been a bumpy season for UCSB thus far, which boasts just a 7-8 overall record, but nevertheless, many positive aspects give the team hope and promise for the latter half of the season. Sophomore infielder Alyssa Diaz fired out of the gate early in the season, leading the Gauchos to a 5-1 commanding start to the year and batting 11-20 (.550) in those six matches. Since then, however, Diaz has been lacking similar tenacity at the plate, putting up a below-average .346 (7-28) batting average as the team has struggled, dropping seven of its past nine games. Overall, in 15 games this season, the pitching staff has been pretty solid for UCSB. As a bullpen, the Gauchos have a 3.51 ERA. However, in losses, UCSB gives up 6.25 runs per game compared to just four runs per game in wins. The ""òChos will kick off this upcoming weekend with a matchup against the Florida International University Panthers on Friday, who are led by junior outfielder Tatyana Forbes. Forbes has been on a tear as of late, leading the Panthers to a 9-8 overall record on the year and batting .395 this season. Ace sophomore pitcher Shannon Saile looks to make her mark on the tournament herself, currently tossing a strong 1.13 ERA and sporting a 6-3 record, as she has displayed overwhelming dominance right out of the gate. Once the tournament is underway, the Gauchos will take on Troy University to complete a doubleheader on day one of the tournament. Troy, currently boasting an 8-6 mark, is coming off a 9-3 loss to Tennessee Tech, and will look to bounce back in the Citrus Classic II as they face UCSB and Florida International in a doubleheader of their own. Sophomore catcher Katie Webb leads the team in batting at .356 while slugging over .367 and adding two deep fly bombs over 12 RBIs on the season. Saturday's workload doesn't decrease much for the ""òChos as they shift their focus to another doubleheader, opening up with a matchup against Niagara University. The Purple Eagles have had a tough start to the season, losing six of their first nine games to bring their record to 3-6 heading into the tournament. In its six losses this year, Niagara has given up an average of nearly nine runs per game and has actually been shut out three times this season. Immediately following the contest against Niagara, UCSB will take on the Binghamton University Bearcats, who look to make a dent into their early season win count. Owners of a 1-3 record, the Bearcats have been quiet this season, but look to rebound with a seven-game stretch over four days in Florida this upcoming weekend. UCSB's action-packed Citrus Classic run will end on Sunday morning as the Gauchos look to end on a strong note against the 5-4 University of Massachusetts Minutemen. Boasting a four-game win streak, UMass is quarterbacked by redshirt senior shortstop Jena Cozza, who has flashed excellence and poise alike over the team's recent four-game ride to success. Cozza, hitting 8-13 (.458) and blasting five long balls over that span, is on pace for a stand-out season in her final year with Amherst. Other teams competing in the 2018 Citrus Classic II include University of Notre Dame, Fordham University, Ball State, Robert Morris University, University of Delaware and the Czech National Team; however, UCSB has its slate complete. Santa Barbara will begin its tournament run at 11:30 a.m. on Friday, March 2, at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.

sports,Gauchos Visit Hawaii To Close Out Conference Season,1-Mar-18,5:07 AM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/gauchos-visit-hawaii-to-close-out-conference-season/,"Mira Shulman looks for a teammate to pass to. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus In its final conference game of the regular season, the UCSB women's basketball team will travel off the mainland and to the island of O'ahu in order to face the Rainbow Wahine this Thursday. With the Big West conference tournament rapidly approaching, the fourth-place Gauchos will aim to close out the regular season with what would be their second win in a row before the postseason gets underway next week. Following their recent win at home against Riverside, the Gauchos are 9-6 in Big West competition and 12-15 overall. Hawai'i, sitting at seventh in the Big West standings, is 4-10 in conference play and 11-16 overall. The Rainbow Wahine are looking to bounce back after a road loss to Long Beach State over the weekend. Additionally, UCSB will hope to defeat Hawai'i for the fourth time in a row, as Hawai'i's last win over Santa Barbara took place in the 2015-2016 season. Crucial to UCSB's success in the Big West this season has been redshirt senior Drew Edelman. The 6'4""ù forward is averaging a double-double in conference play with 16.9 points per game and 10.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 60.8 percent from the field. In addition to her offensive efficiency, Edelman has scored in double figures against Big West opponents in all but two games this season. ""úI told her a few weeks ago just how proud I was of her,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úJust being able to maintain poise and composure because she gets a lot of attention, a lot of traffic, a lot of physicality. She's done a really good job of handling that pressure and not playing backwards because of a missed call or bad call.""ù In the Gauchos' home victory over Riverside, Edelman led her team with 27 points, tying her season high for points in a single game. Luckily for UCSB, Edelman's other 27-point game this season came against none other than Hawai'i. In their visit to the Thunderdome on Feb. 3, the Rainbow Wahine were outrebounded 32-26 by the Gauchos and outscored in the paint 42-27, a sign of Edelman's significant paint presence on both ends of the floor. A concern for the Gauchos will be whether or not they can replicate their efficient shooting against Hawai'i, since Santa Barbara shot 48 percent overall, 50 percent from beyond the arc and 90 percent from the free-throw line in the last meeting. For Hawai'i, disrupting UCSB's offense early and limiting Edelman's paint touches will be key, but the Rainbow Wahine have a weapon of their own: Sarah Toeaina. In her senior season, guard Toeaina is averaging 16 points per game and 6.1 rebounds per contest while shooting 51.5 percent overall from the field. Toeaina scored 25 points in Hawai'i's latest visit to the Thunderdome, and the senior has drawn high praise from coach Henrickson. ""úShe's a kid who really competes. She's composed and has a great mid-range game. She gets on the offensive glass and gets out in transition, so we've got our hands full, we've got to be prepared.""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe need to limit where they like to catch it, what shots they like to get, where they're most efficient and be more disruptive in that action. She leads the league in free-throw attempts, she's coming off a game where she had 19 against Long Beach State. That's not the answer because now she's scoring while she's resting.""ù Toeaina will certainly be a tough assignment for the Santa Barbara guards and help defenders; however, one of UCSB's freshman guards, Sarah Bates, has drawn praise from her head coach as well. Averaging 13.6 points per game in Big West competition, Bates is the Gauchos' second-leading scorer and knocks down 43.8 percent of shots from beyond the arc. ""úIn a role where she's played a ton of minutes, and we've needed her to do a lot of different things for us,""ù Henrickson said. ""úShe's been able to step up and answer that which has been important for us.""ù With the Big West Tournament scheduled for next week, Thursday's game marks the last of the regular season, but UCSB remains focused on what's next. ""úThis time of the year we're just trying to eliminate game slippage and understand what our responsibilities are to find success,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe want to build momentum off the other night and build momentum getting a road win and be able to get as many conference wins before the tournament since we've been here, which is a little milestone for us.""ù The Gauchos will take on Hawai'i on Thursday, March 1, with tip-off scheduled for 9 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu.

sports,March Is Here! The Race for First Continues for UCSB,1-Mar-18,5:10 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-01/march-is-here-the-race-for-first-continues-for-ucsb/,"Sitting just a half game out of first place in the Big West, the UCSB men's basketball team is staring down the most important week of the season to date. Two home games, the first against Long Beach State and the second against Cal Poly, will determine how the Gauchos enter the Big West Tournament and likely what seed they'll hold. Only a week and a half ago, UCSB sat in the driver's seat of the Big West. Two tough losses ""ì the first against UC Davis and the second against UC Irvine ""ì dropped the Gauchos behind the Anteaters and into a tie for second with the Aggies, a much more precarious position. Those two losses were the result of two of the worst offensive performances the Gauchos, now 21-7 overall and 10-4 in the Big West, have had all year, but the team showed signs of a resurgence in their win on Saturday over CSUN. ""úThe game [against CSUN] was our best offensive efficiency game of the year,""ù Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úI thought our guys did a great job of sharing the basketball and getting great shots on offense, which the previous two games we struggled with.""ù Thursday night's game against the Beach will be a test of the sustainability of the rediscovered offensive success for both the team and its key players. Graduate transfer forward Leland King II bounced back from a combined nine points against Davis and Irvine with a 25-point, 12-rebound performance against CSUN, and his continued production will be essential to the Gauchos' success. Equally important to offensive production, of course, is defensive performance. In Pasternack's eyes, the two are directly tied together, as defensive success directly feeds offensive success. ""úThis week, our complete focus is being able to defend and rebound for 40 minutes,""ù Pasternack said. ""úWhen we do that, our offense will take care of itself. When the ball is coming out of the net, we don't get fast break points. When we can get stops and run, that's when we're at our best.""ù The return of senior forward Jalen Canty will likely be a big help in both the defensive and offensive departments. Canty missed the last six games due to a suspension for violating team rules, but will return on Thursday night against Long Beach, giving UCSB some sorely needed shot-blocking and offensive diversity. Long Beach State will enter the Thunderdome as losers of its last three games and in a tie for fifth place in the Big West at 7-7. The Beach has struggled to get stops in each of their last three games, surrendering at least 70 points in all of them and 80 points twice. After seeing an opening, Marcus Jackson heads for the hoop. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The story offensively for Long Beach State is the same as it was when UCSB traveled to the Walter Pyramid a few weeks ago: senior forward Gabe Levin is the one to stop. Levin is leading the Big West in conference scoring per game, but he doesn't have another teammate in the top 20. After Long Beach State on Thursday, the Gauchos will take on Cal Poly in the Thunderdome on Saturday for Senior Night. The Mustangs have just four wins in Big West play this season, but one of those came at UCSB's expense all the way back on Jan. 4, so Saturday's Blue-Green Rivalry matchup has the added motivation of a revenge game for the Gauchos. As UCSB's last game before the Big West Tournament, the matchup against Cal Poly will also be an important tune-up for the team. Working Canty back into the lineup and continuing to rehabilitate the offense will both take time, something the Gauchos won't have much of once the tournament starts. As evidenced by their 9-19 overall record and 4-10 mark in conference play, the Mustangs have had a rough go of things this season. That Jan. 4 win over UCSB, secured with three last-second free throws, may have been the high point of Cal Poly's season. All the same, the Gauchos can't afford to overlook the Mustangs, as tempting as it might be with the Big West Tournament in sight. Guards Victor Joseph and Donovan Fields hurt UCSB the first time around and are coming off of strong games against CSUN. Joseph is sixth in the Big West in points per game in conference play with 15.8 and has knocked down 40.9 of his three-point attempts against conference opponents. The senior guard dropped 36 points in the Mustangs' double-overtime win over the Marauders, and will test the Gauchos' ability to provide 40 minutes of solid defense. A sweep of this week would give UCSB a home record of 13-1 for the year, its best since at least the 1980-81 season. Two strong games by King and Max Heidegger would also likely push the pair into third place on the list of all time UCSB scoring duos, as they currently sit just 41 points behind Michael Bryson and Gabe Vincent, who combined for 1,042 points in 2015-16. There's a lot on the line for the Gauchos this week, but most important is the first-place slot in the Big West. Two wins guarantee UCSB at least a half-share of the regular season crown, an incredible turnaround for a team that finished in dead last at 4-12 last season. The Gauchos host Long Beach State on Thursday night at 8 p.m. in an ESPNU-televised matchup, and then close their season in the Thunderdome against Cal Poly on Saturday at 7 p.m. for Senior Night.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After two disappointing road losses, the UCSB men's tennis team will look to bounce back at home Saturday against St Mary's. In particular, the Gauchos were devastated by their loss against New Mexico on Sunday, a match in which they held a 3-0 lead. But the Lobos rallied all the way back, and senior captain Simon Freund, who was playing through an injury, couldn't keep his lead on court two. With the availability of Freund in question for the match, Santa Barbara will have to lean on its younger team members to come away with the victory. In particular, they will look to standout sophomore Joseph Guillin to right the ship should Freund miss time. Guillin has been a surprise revelation for the Gauchos so far this year, winning seven singles matches in a row heading into the matchup with the Gaels and sporting an 8-1 overall mark. ""ú[Guillin] has demonstrated he's going to win at the three and four position, but we'd like to move him up high and see what his top end is,""ù Head Coach Marty Davis said. ""úHis tennis IQ is super high, and he sees the game well which means we don't have to spend time coaching him during matches.""ù While St Mary's enters the match with a 2-5 record, they are coming off a 4-3 victory over Grand Canyon in their last match. In addition, while UCSB defeated the Gaels 7-0 last year, four of the six singles matches went to a third set, and another was forced to drop out because of injury. This year, St Mary's returns much of that team, including their top two players, sophomore Damon Kesaris and senior Nash Vollenweider. ""úTheir top two players are both really good, and they're definitely better than their record shows,""ù Davis said. In particular, Kesaris has been playing dominant tennis this year. Last year, the South African was named the WCC freshman of the year, as well as All-WCC first team singles. This year, he has built on that success, kicking the season off with a 6-1 record in singles. Junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran barely beat him in three sets last year, and the rematch should prove to be an entertaining bout on court one. The court one doubles duo of Kesaris and Vollenweider will also pose a challenge to the Gauchos; last season, the two were named All-WCC honorable mentions for doubles. With Moreno de Alboran and junior Anders Holm playing well on court one, that matchup should also shape up to be a nail-biter. Where the Gaels have struggled, however, has been on the lower courts. In two of their seven matches this season, Kesaris was the only player on the team to notch a victory. If the Gauchos are to pull off the victory on Saturday, they will have to depend on Holm, freshman Viktor Krustev and junior Hironori Koyanagi to win their individual matches. In his return from injury last week, Krustev went 1-1, losing his match against Utah but winning in straight sets against the Lobos. He will need to build on that momentum on Saturday for UCSB to alleviate pressure off of Moreno de Alboran and Guillin. For the Gauchos, this match will be their first of four in the next two weeks because of their reshuffled schedule following the Thomas fire. Less than 24 hours after the game, the team will leave to Tucson to take on the University of Arizona. Santa Barbara currently holds a 6-0 record in the all-time series against St Mary's and will look to remain unbeaten against the Gaels. UCSB will take on St. Mary's at 1 p.m. on Saturday, March 3, at the Rec Cen courts.

Away from home for a regular season matchup, Santa Barbara traveled down to USC for the first of two road games this week. It was a high scoring night full of close scoring totals, yet the Gauchos seemed to come up clutch when it most mattered as the Trojans just couldn't keep up. In the end, it was a four set encounter which had UCSB pulling through by a 3-1 victory on the night. Ultimately, this game was fought in the trenches. Starting in the first set, Trojan errors allowed a consecutive five-point streak for their opponents as the Gauchos got off to an early lead of 7-2. Halfway through it, USC were able to bring back to within 1 at 19-18. Regardless, another flurry of both attacking and defensive mistakes, resulting in a game-high of seven errors, was what cost the home side a set one victory. In the next set, the UCSB attack proved almost perfect as they earned a game-high hitting percentage of .520, more than twice as much as their counterparts in the same time. Still, the USC defense was able to match the tempo this time and actually allowed the hosts a small margin of the lead for the majority of the second set. However, once Santa Barbara broke into the lead they never gave it up again, as even a 2 point lead was enough for them to take the second set at a score of 25-23. With momentum now fully in favor of the visitors, USC sought to steal this third set away in hopes of sparking a reverse sweep comeback. Running away with an early 6-2 lead, the Trojans came out of the break at full throttle. Meanwhile, closing out the final set was and remained to be a recurring issue as the Gauchos continuously trailed through it all. At a final set score of 22-25, UCSB really needed to tighten up their play if the wished to ensure this away game win. And that they did as the scoring talents of sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders and junior outside hitter Corey Chavers made their presence known the most in the fourth and final set. These two were both on fire as they combined for a whopping 15 kills in this set alone. Luckily, they also had sophomore setter Randy DeWeese to take control of this game by the reigns as he got it done on both ends of assists and blocking; DeWeese accounted for 47 of the teams 52 assists on the night. With all respects to USC, they seemed to trail UCSB this last set in both scoring and pace of play. That would eventually be their downfall as they took a defeat in their own home and as the Gauchos earned the 3-1 win on the road. The Gauchos' two-game mini road trip continues this week as they head down south to face off against UC San Diego for another Big West Conference matchup.

In the midst of its worst season under then-Head Coach Bob Williams, the team hosted CSUF with an abysmal 3-16 overall mark and just one win in conference play. The one thing UCSB had going for them was guard Gabe Vincent. At the time, Vincent was the team's leading scorer, averaging 14.8 points per game, and added along 3.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. His 51 threes were the most on the team and, just a week and a half earlier, he had become the 28th Gaucho to score 1,000 points in a career. The point is, Vincent was good. The former Big West Freshman of the Year and All-Big West Honorable Mention was still having a great season despite his teams' poor play. SETBACK Going up against Fullerton, Vincent was still showing the same fire he showed all season. Nothing was going to stop the Stockton, Calif. native;† not if he had anything to say about it, at least. Unfortunately for him, there was nothing he could do about what happened late in the first half. Gabe Vincent dribbles to the basket. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After driving into the lane, Vincent jumped in the air and drew the foul, but when he fell, he landed awkwardly on his left knee. The crowd quieted down, the coaching staff looked worried, and Vincent went to the bench with a grimacing look. UCSB would go on to lose the match 79-53, and worse, the Gauchos feared that they would lose Vincent for the remainder of the season. Their fears were realized just one day later when an MRI revealed he had suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and would be sidelined for a minimum of six-to-eight months. Vincent said that all he could think about was, ""úHow soon can I play again?""ù ""úI never really second-guessed [the timetable] I was given. It took me a few weeks to really process what was going on, but after that I went through the motions of trying to come back and getting healthy.""ù For Coach Williams, the injury hurt him just the same. After all, he was the man that recruited Vincent to UCSB. ""úI am heartbroken for Gabe and the team,""ù Williams said to UCSB Athletics. ""úHe's been a stud for three years and has also become our team's leader. Knowing Gabe, I believe he will bounce back from this and be stronger than ever.""ù Williams got it right with that last statement. CHANGE Once the 2017 season ended, Vincent was met with the bad news that his senior season would come with the shellshock of having to work with an entirely new coaching staff. Following a disappointing 6-22 season and missing the Big West Tournament, the university decided not to extend Williams's contract and go in a different direction. While obviously saddened by the news, Vincent knew he had his own worries that he needed to take care of. ""úIt really hurt a lot; me and Bob [Williams] were close, and he recruited me, and he was a big part of the reason I came to UCSB,""ù Vincent said. ""úWith that being said, that's how this business goes, and we knew we had to move forward, and we responded well.""ù While coming back from an ACL tear is nothing new in this day and age thanks to wonderful medical advances, it is still a long grind, and not everyone returns to peak form. To Vincent's credit, he never thought negatively. He put his head down and worked every single day to be ready come the season opener in 2018. ""úEvery day was a struggle. I don't think there is anyone that has been hurt in that way who can tell you it is easy,""ù Vincent said. ""úIt's not a fun process, not easy, but you just have to take it day by day. You have good days and bad days, but at the end you're working to come back.""ù And while Vincent was working hard, the UCSB administrative staff was working hard as well, hoping to add another great basketball coach to the rotation. On April 4, UCSB introduced Joe Pasternack as their new head coach, and right away he went to work adding graduate transfers Marcus Jackson and Leland King II. Along with the additions, Pasternack was adamant about bringing his new philosophy to this team and bring a new attitude. Most importantly, he wanted to bring a new culture, one that ""úhonors the process.""ù ""úCoach Pasternack did a great job of bringing in a great staff and great guys like Marcus and Leland to help us compete,""ù Vincent said. ""úHe is a real competitor and he loves to win, and that's what he is all about.""ù All this constant activity and excitement only made the former St. Mary's High School standout anxious. RESURGENCE Still, all his hard work would pay off as on Saturday, Nov. 11, Vincent returned right on schedule to start the season opener against North Dakota State. While breakout sophomore guard Max Heidegger stole the stage with an astonishing 33 points in the Gauchos 85-66 win, Vincent was still there, playing as hard as ever. The senior would finish the night with seven points and a career high of eight assists on just 17 minutes. ""úMy greatest memory [in these last four years] is probably my first game back from injury,""ù Vincent said. ""úSuiting back up with the guys again after something that happened so tragically, and in the midst of such a terrible season, to turning it around to what this season has become is unbelievable.""ù Coming back after a torn left ACL, Gabe Vincent jumps for the hoop. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus As games kept coming and going, Vincent and the Gauchos would just get better and better. Against UC Irvine at the Thunderdome, a game that was televised on ESPNU, Vincent stole the show. The senior dropped a then season-high 21 points on the Anteaters and led the Gauchos to a primetime win. Even better, it was his first full game without his knee brace, as it broke just a few nights earlier against, coincidentally enough, Cal State Fullerton. ""úI planned on getting out of the brace a week later so really it just came early; so it was different, but it worked out well, and now I feel stronger and stronger every day,""ù Vincent said. Fast-forward to the current day, and UCSB has more than tripled its win total from the last season with a 21-7 overall mark and is currently fighting for first place in the conference standings heading into the final week of the regular season. From six wins to 21, this season has been a complete 180 for Vincent. ""úIt is special. I mean, this group we have in general is special. They are a big part of the reason why I wanted to get back so quickly ""¶ because I saw the potential this team had,""ù Vincent said. ""úNow we just have to finish this the right way and set out what we wanted to accomplish at the beginning of the year.""ù Like Vincent said at the end, however, the mission is still not over. The Gauchos still have goals of winning the Big West Tournament and making an NCAA run. That doesn't mean the former Big West Freshman of the Year shouldn't enjoy his final home games, though. In a 70-69 loss against LBSU on Thursday, Vincent scored a career high 28 points. The loss may have overshadowed Vincent's new career high, but if Thursday highlighted anything, it is that Vincent is back and he will be a problem come tournament time. The senior is now averaging 12.6 points per game, on a career high 45 percent shooting heading into his final game at the Thunderdome to culminate what will be a spectacular career. ""úTo be honest, this whole season has been pretty emotional, coming back from injury, day by day knowing it's my last season, so things have been building up,""ù Vincent said. ""úI'm sure it will be emotional, but I just have to harness it into a good game.""ù RIVALRY/FINALE As luck would have it, Vincent's final home game will be Saturday against the Gauchos biggest rival, Cal Poly. The Mustangs stole the first meeting between the Blue-Green rivals, 80-79. ""úThe rivalry is real; I don't know how else to put it. Even being at SLO is just different,""ù Vincent said. ""úBut I am happy to compete against them again, especially after dropping that last game. It was my first loss to Cal Poly during my time here. I took it real personally, so I am excited to get them back over here.""ù With Saturday marking the end of Vincent's brilliant career, one might surmise that he wants to be the one to steal the show. But those who know him personally know that Vincent is as humble as they come. ""úIt's going to be just another game. If I go off, I go off, and if I don't, I don't, but as long as we get a win at the end of the day,""ù Vincent said. Beyond this season, if there is one thing Vincent loves, it is basketball. This will not be his final stop, something he is very adamant about. ""úNBA is the dream, always has been and definitely is not something I plan on giving up on now,""ù Vincent said. ""úEven if I can't make it, this is still going to be my career. I have to make money somehow so whether it be overseas or G-League, I am just going to be excited to continue my career.""ù If there is one thing this piece highlights, it is that Vincent is as resilient as they come. The senior is going to leave behind quite a legacy here at UCSB, and yet, all he wants to be remembered as is ""úa good teammate and a guy that loves to compete and win.""ù That will not be a problem, Gabe.

Play at Claremont Convergence Tournament,3-Mar-18,1:30 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-03/ucsb-continues-non-conf-play-at-claremont-convergence-tournament/,"Nexus File Photo The No. 16 UCSB women's water polo team, who currently stands at 10-8 overall, will head to Claremont this weekend where it will play two games on Saturday at the Claremont Convergence Tournament. To start the weekend, the Gauchos will play the University of Redlands, who has struggled this season with a 1-8 record overall. The Bulldogs have only won one game this season against Occidental on Feb. 21. Later that afternoon, Santa Barbara will face Pomona-Pitzer, who is 4-2 on the season. Both teams are looking to snap their respective losing streaks, with Santa Barbara currently in a two game skid while the Bulldogs are in a four game drought. Redlands last played against No. 10 UC Davis in the Santa Clara Invite Tournament in which it suffered a devastating 24-5 loss at the hands of the Aggies. Looking ahead to UCSB's second opponent on the day, Pomona-Pitzer is likely to present more of a challenge. Although the Sagehens have only played a total of six games this year, they have averaged 11 goals, and have given up an average of just seven goals per game. Senior Attacker Morgan McCracken leads the team with 17 goals thus far. UCSB last played in the Barbara Kalbus Invitational last Sunday, where it endured a heartbreaking loss to Loyola Marymount by a score of 4-3. Despite a couple of early goals from sophomore attacker Natalie Selin and freshman attacker Mollie Simmons, the ""òChos fell behind after a 4-0 run by the Lions between the end of the first period to the end of the third period. Sophomore Utility Sarah Snyder was able to find the back of the net with a little over three minutes left but the Gauchos were unable to complete the comeback. Selin, in particular, had not only an impressive game against LMU but also made her presence felt in the other three games of the Invitational, scoring a total of four goals this past weekend. ""úShe has done a great job,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay said. ""úShe is only a sophomore and she has really stepped up this year with having one year under her belt. She creates tempo in transition and moves a lot in the front court.""ù Even though UCSB is currently on a two game losing streak, the young Gauchos' are still confident that they can get back on track. ""úOur confidence is good,""ù Kay explained. ""úIt is important that we understand we are right in the middle of this season. Patience and really focusing on the little things is what is going to be important at this moment.""ù UCSB has played a total of 18 games this season, with many of those matches going against schools that are ranked in the top 10 in the country. ""úIt helps us grow as a team,""ù Selin stated. ""úEverything at this point is meant to help further develop us as a team.""ù Santa Barbara will look to get back in the win column as it will play Redlands at 1 p.m. and Pomona-Pitzer at 5 p.m. on Saturday, March 3 at the Claremont Convergence Tournament.

sports,Gauchos Blowout Cal Poly in Senior Night Finale,4-Mar-18,6:58 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-blowout-cal-poly-in-senior-night-finale/,"After bringing the ball back in play, Max Heidegger moves up the court. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus A 86-61 rout of Blue-Green rival Cal Poly on Senior Night secured the second best regular season finish in school history for the UCSB men's basketball team. The Gauchos were knocked out of first place contention in the Big West with the loss to Long beach State on Thursday, yet their 22-8 overall, 11-5 conference record was good for second place and the second seed in the Big West tournament. Cal Poly ended the regular season with a 9-21 overall, 4-12 conference record and a date with UCSB in the first round. One of the key messages Coach Pasternack has been pushing since the beginning of his tenure with the Gauchos is the importance of a strong home court advantage. After a shaky season last year due to injuries, the revitalization of the Thunderdome has been huge both for the team and the school. The season finale was almost filled to capacity thirty minutes before the game, and the difference in atmosphere compared to the two home losses last week shows that the team really does feed off the hype of the crowd. ""úWhile we are playing for ourselves, we're also playing for the fans and everybody out there""ù, Max Heidegger explained postgame. ""úThat energy carries over so when they get excited we get more excited.""ù The Gauchos were almost a little too excited to start off the match Sunday night, but once the pre-game jitters wore off they composed one of their best offensive games of the year. Early in the first half it was the usual suspects leading the way on the offense, as both graduate transfer Leland King II and sophomore Max Heidegger caught fire. The forward/guard duo combined for 26 of SB's 38 points, which is a welcome sight heading into the tournament after the dip in production they've both had these last weeks. King II's hot three point shooting helped UCSB build a double digit lead about halfway through the first period, and they ended the half up by eight. On the defensive end, center Jalen Canty's return has energized the team. The Gauchos limited Cal Poly to 33.3% shooting in the first half, and a big part of it is how the senior anchors the defense. Other than junior Josh Martin who got much of his 23 points in garbage time, the Mustangs were not able to get anything going in the interior. While Canty does average almost 2 blocks per game, it's actually his knack for getting defensive rebounds to close out possessions that really changes the game for UCSB. Cutting off second chance opportunities will be huge for the Gauchos going into the tournament, as previous losses against teams like Irvine and Davis show how vital winning the rebound battle is. UCSB blew the game open in the second half, and in the process put on a passing showcase. The team finished with a season high 27 assists, which is a school record, and shot 67% overall from the field for the half. Although ball movement has been a core tenet of this team since Coach Pasternack took over, it seems that the offensive synergy of the squad is picking up just at the right moment. ""úI don't think I've ever been part of a team that's gotten 27 assists in a game""ù, Coach Pasternack admitted. ""ú I think what we learned is that when we share the ball, when we have five people on the court that can shoot it's hard to decide who to focus on""¶ and if we share the ball like this we're going to be tough to beat.""ù Unsurprisingly it was guard Gabe Vincent who led the team in assists with 7 in his final home game as a Gaucho. The senior received a standing ovation as he left the court, and although he didn't score as much his facilitation was what made the offense run smoothly. His ability to lead by sharing and yet still get points when needed are why he's been the key player for this school for years. †While the team looks ahead to the tournament, it's important to commemorate Vincent's already amazing career as a Gaucho. Moving forward, UCSB plays the seventh-ranked Mustangs again on Thursday in the first round of the Big West tournament. Although this last game was a blowout, Coach Pasternack stressed postgame that the Gauchos are not underestimating their opponent. Coming off of a season where they didn't even make the Big West tournament there's no doubt that this team is hungry, it's just gonna be up to the players to execute the gameplan.

sports,"Gauchos Clinch Series With Solid One-Hitter, Shutout Performance",4-Mar-18,11:13 PM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-04/gauchos-clinch-series-with-solid-one-hitter-shutout-performance/,"Jason Willow swings at a high fastball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The midway game of the series between the UCSB baseball team and the Penn State Nittany Lions was headlined by the stellar pitching by the home team as both junior Noah Davis and redshirt junior Chris Clements pitched a combined one-hitter, shutout to clinch the series victory for UCSB. Sunday's victory inches the Gauchos closer to a more respectable mark as they boast a 4-6 overall record. The win also preserved the ""òChos unbeaten 3-0 record at home. Penn State falls to 3-5 on the year and has lost its fifth-consecutive match. Davis took the mound for the first time Sunday afternoon since making his first start on February 16th and allowed a single up the middle in the first to junior catcher Ryan Sloniger. Davis got out of the first inning jam with two men on base and quickly settled into a rhythm in the subsequent innings. The Huntington Beach native was consistent in his six innings of work and only appeared to get better as the game went on. The junior notched nine strikeouts and managed to strike out the side swinging in the top of the fifth before making his exit an inning later. As usual the Gaucho bats took some time to heat up, but like in previous games the team managed to get the offense going in the fourth inning. Sophomore catcher Eric Yang hit an extra-base shot to left field which pushed sophomore utility Armani Smith across the plate for the first run scored in the game. In what would eventually be three consecutive innings with at least one run scored, Clay Fisher had his own extra-base drive to center right where he picked up two RBI's to increase the UCSB lead to 3-0 at the top of the 6th. The home team's final run of the game was scored by the quick-thinking feet of sophomore Tommy Jew and junior Thomas Rowan. After advancing to third on Jew's single to center, Rowan was able to score on a throw to second as Jew was trying to steal the bag. The 4-0 lead was enough for skipper Andrew Checketts to pull Davis and put in Chris Clements for his opportunity to pick up a save. Like Davis, Clements was outstanding on the mound: allowing zero hits, zero runs, and striking out five over his three innings of work. The Gauchos cruised to victory after putting up two in the fifth, snagging the win, 4-0. Clements made well of his first save opportunity of the season and should the redshirt junior be able to carry his pitching success in starting as well as in relief he looks to be a valuable tool for the team if they make another deep run into the NCAA tournament. With today's solid start, Davis bounced back from his previous outing against San Diego State where the junior was pulled in less than two innings in a game where he allowed three hits and five earned runs. The Gauchos' bats have been active all series against this Penn State pitching staff and the big four are making their usual impact felt in these important early season games. Penn State starter Taylor Lehman pitched a solid five innings with two earned runs allowed, but with an offense that was completely stifled behind him the pitching staff could only do the best they could to keep the lead from getting worse. Connor Larkin was called into the final two innings for the Penn State Nittany Lions and pitched well with no runs allowed. They are surely hoping for a bounce back game with a more active offense to support them. UCSB will play the final game of the series against Penn State on Monday, March 5th at 2 PM PST at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Now on a three-game win streak, the UCSB men's volleyball team found itself in fine form after its most recent conquest against the conference opponent Tritons. This was the second and last matchup of the Gauchos mini road trip as they came out on top once again with a 3-0 sweep victory over UCSD. Last time out, these two teams battled for it all throughout five intense sets. Fortunately, the Santa Barbara home side prevailed in a 3-2 win. This time around the home court was in their counterpart's favor and the Gauchos got the job done once more and in even better style. Friday night's matchup got off to a great start as both teams showed a high intensity that proved they came to play. Most of the first set always had each team within a few points difference of each other, but it wasn't until UCSB notched on a 3 point run to their lead that put the score at 20-13. Promptly after this San Diego called a time out to attempt to quell the momentum, which it temporarily did. Nonetheless, UCSB's emphasized practice, of minimizing free point mistakes and focusing on finishing, was newly on display as they coasted through to the end by a final result of 25-20. In the second set, it was again another close affair until about the halfway point. Then at the 9-9 split mark, the Tritons turned the tables and went on a four point streak that brought the game to 12-9 in their favor. Then as similar as the first set, a timeout from the opposite end halted the game momentum and the Gauchos went on to score 7 points to the Tritons' single point in that same allotted time. This burst back into the set ultimately gave the visiting Gauchos their second win of the night, at 25-21, and brought the set score to 2-0. There were many key players involved in UCSB's crushing road victory last Friday, however it was particularly sophomore setter Randy DeWeese and sophomore middle blocker Brandon Hopper who took over control defensively late in the third set closer; the pair combined for a total of 13 blocks this match. On the night the Gauchos' hitting percentage was finalized at .326, as compared to the Tritons' .244; Santa Barbara also had 5 times more aces and almost twice as many blocks, truly showing the difference in class as proven by the Gauchos' still nationally ranked spot at No. 15. Following this defeat, San Diego still remains winless in this young conference campaign; whereas this most recent win for UCSB continues to solidify their lead as the number one spot in the Big West Conference standings. Volleyball returns next week as well, as the Gauchos return home for a short pair of regular season games as they'll first face off against Fort Wayne on Friday, March 9th, then against No. 11 Ball State on Saturday, March 10th; both games to be held at 7PM in the Robertson Gymnasium.

The two teams looked like even competitors right out of the gate, ending the first inning with a score of 1 to 2, Gauchos ahead. Together, the teams totaled a combined 22 hits and two home runs after seven innings. UCSB's sophomore Alyssa Diaz homered into left center for 2 RBIs in the first inning. UMass's redshirt senior Jena Cozza, who also leads the team's offensive lineup with a .462 batting average, followed suit in the sixth inning. However, UCSB granted Umass two unearned runs in the third inning, giving them the lead with it. From then on, UCSB found themselves trying to catch-up and failed to regain their place on top. UMass rookie pitcher Kiara Oliver started her first game of the series and successfully kept UCSB off-balance at the plate. She had ten strikeouts on the day and of her 125 pitches threw 81 strikes, capping her strike percentage at 70%. Where the Gauchos only scored in the first and fifth innings, UMass racked up runs in four out of the seven innings played. In total, the Gauchos gave up four unearned runs, potentially accounting for the four-point deficit in their final score. The team's offensive statistics for the Citrus Classic II series ended with a .300 batting average,† dropping from the .315 average they maintained before game five of the weekend. In the five games, the Gauchos gave up twelve unearned runs and made thirteen errors. Their lack of offensive and defensive solidity resulted in a tough blow to the team as they now come back home and continue their pre-season games. UCSB looks to decrease their win-loss deficit at home in a double header against Florida Gulf Coast on Wednesday, March 7.

Santa Barbara started the tournament against the University of Redlands, a team that has been struggling with a 2-9 record on the year. After winning a thriller earlier in the day against Mckendree with a 6-5 win, the Bulldogs were finally able to snap their six game losing streak. In the first half, the ""òChos scored a total of 12 goals while also preserving their clean sheet by not allowing a goal against them. Junior Utility Kate Pipkin had a hat trick in the first half and finished the game with three goals and two assists. The second half featured more of the same with Santa Barbara scoring seven more goals. Sophomore Attacker Natalie Selin was able to find the back of the net with five minutes left in the game to complete her hat trick. Despite being held scoreless in the first half, the Bulldogs were able convert twice in the second half. Sophomore Attacker Courtney Gray was able to convert at the three minute mark in the third period while Junior Center Kolby Kahahawai was able to score at the six minute mark in the fourth period. UCSB won the game by a final score of 19-2 behind an impressive defensive performance. Despite the Bulldogs having 24 shots on goal, they were only able to beat Freshman Goalkeeper Becca Buck twice. Later that afternoon, Santa Barbara played against the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens who came into the game with an overall record of 6-4 after dropping a game earlier in the day to Cal Baptist. The two teams last met at the Winter Invitational in Santa Barbara last year, where the Gauchos dominated and won the game with a final a score of 15-5. Both teams started the first period red hot offensively with the Gauchos taking an early 3-2 lead behind Sophomore Utility Sarah Snyder netting a goal as well as assisting on Sophomore Utility Kate Coski's goal. The momentum quickly swung in Santa Barbara's favor in the second period with the ""òChos tallying up two more goals while keeping the Sagehens off the board to complete the first half with a 5-2 lead. The Sagehens started to find their rhythm in the third period as they found the back of the net three times, with two of them coming from their star player Senior Attacker Morgan McCracken. UCSB's Pipkin was able to convert on a goal in the middle of the Sagehens' rally off of an assist from Selin.† Although Santa Barbara gave up three goals in the third period, they still had a 6-5 lead heading into the fourth period. In dramatic fashion, McCracken was able to score the only goal between both teams in the fourth period to send the game into overtime. Pomona-Pitzer's' Junior Utility Nohea Kahaulelio started the first overtime period with a goal at the two minute mark but Santa Barbara's Junior Utility Sarah Kreiser responded to knot the game up at 7-7 with only one minute left in the second overtime. This set the stage for the sudden death period where the next team to score would win the match. With two seconds left in the period, Pipkin was able to find the back of the net, handing the Gauchos an 8-7 win. Santa Barbara will look to continue their two game winning streak next weekend as they head to Long Beach to take on Long Beach State at 12 p.m. on Saturday March 10th.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After just two days of rest following a 4-3 loss to SMU, the UCSB women's tennis team fought through two tough road matches against Arizona and No. 33 Arizona State on Friday and Saturday. Despite having little time off from play, the Gauchos were able to route the Wildcats 4-0 on Friday, before falling 4-0 to the Sun Devils the day after. The 6-8 Gauchos came to play on Friday, and kicked off their weekend in style with a quick 4-0 shutout of Arizona. The Wildcats had dominated their home courts in the weeks prior to Friday's match, with just one home loss to No. 49 Houston on Feb. 11. UCSB handed Arizona its second home loss of the season, due to a resurgence in doubles and singles play. After a shocking lapse in doubles play last Tuesday, the Gauchos bounced back on Friday against the Wildcats, securing an early lead in their first match of the weekend. UCSB's star No. 57 ranked duo of seniors Natalie Da Silveira and Palina Duvabets were exemplary as usual, defeating Arizona's duo of freshman Mary Lewis and sophomore Marie Van Aelst 6-2, and extending their doubles win streak to four in-a-row. Doubles play quickly became more contentious, following Arizona's 6-0 defeat of the Gauchos' duo of sophomore Amit Lev Ari and junior Stephanie Yamada. However, UCSB quickly locked up the doubles point with a 6-3 win from its duo of senior Amanda Atanasson and freshman Lise Sentenac. Duvabets and Atanasson were quick to add to the Gauchos' point total in singles play, with two back-to-back wins against the Wildcats. The match point was secured shortly after by Lev Ari, who defeated Arizona's freshman Gitte Heynemans 6-3 and 7-6 in two sets. Lev Ari has been dominant in her recent singles appearances, boasting a record of 4-1 in her last five games. The Gauchos' weekend headed in the opposite direction the day after, which ended in a 4-0 shutout to Arizona State. UCSB had no answer for ASU, which took every single set of the afternoon, and appeared to be on track to a 7-0 victory had the unfinished matches played out. ASU split up its two ranked doubles pairings heading into its match against the Gauchos, which amounted to a very swift doubles point victory. The Sun Devils set the tone of the match with an early 6-0 victory, from their duo of sophomore Savannah Slaysman and freshman Sasa Klanecek, against the Gauchos' Sentenac and Atanasson. ASU's freshman Lauryn John-Baptiste and sophomore Ilze Hattingh dealt with UCSB's Lev Ari and Yamada in a similar fashion, defeating the duo 6-1 and locking up the doubles point. The Gauchos' struggles against the Sun Devils continued in singles play. ASU's freshman Tereza Kolarova kicked things off with a near shutout of UCSB's Yamada, defeating her 6-1 and 6-0 in two sets. Kolarova's victory was followed by another dominant victory by ASU's Hattingh, who pulled off a shutout against Atanasson, with scores of 6-0 in both sets. Securing the match point for ASU was No. 84 ranked John-Baptiste, who defeated the Gauchos' Duvabets 6-2 and 6-3 in two sets, and secured a shutout for her team. UCSB has struggled against ranked opponents this season, with five losses to nationally ranked teams and† a single win against No. 32 USC. With two more ranked opponents on their radar leading up to the Big West tournament, it is clear that things will remain challenging for the 6-8 Gauchos. After taking this week to rest and recover, the Gauchos will return to their home courts for a match against Penn on Saturday followed by Loyola Marymount on Sunday. With an increased amount of time to prepare, UCSB will hope to elevate its record to the .500 mark this weekend.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following its loss to No. 8 Hawaii in the final game of the regular season, the UCSB women's basketball team will travel to Fullerton, Calif., where they'll be awaiting their second-round matchup. The Gauchos finished fourth in the Big West at 9-7 and closed out the season 12-16 overall. Considering that this team preparing for a playoff run lost nine games in a row earlier this season is remarkable and demonstrates Santa Barbara's ability to adapt as well as the coaching staff's ability to get the best out of players over the course of a season. ""úThis time of year you have to be familiar and dust off the cobwebs,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úKnowing personnel sets what we need to do. It's more about your effort, your activity level, your energy and your toughness at this point. We've got to manufacture some offense from the free-throw line and in transition.""ù Due to the interesting playoff format of the Big West, UCSB doesn't actually have a set opponent yet. The Gauchos have a bye for round one, in which teams seeded 5-8 will compete. Out of those four teams (No. 5 CSUN versus No. 8 Hawaii, No. 6 UC Riverside versus No. 7 LBSU), the two winners will advance to play either UCSB or No. 3 UC Irvine. Santa Barbara will take on the highest seed to advance while Irvine will take on the lowest. First place UC Davis as well as second place Cal Poly each receive a double-bye and will await the winners of the UCSB and Irvine games. ""ú[The season] really has played itself out to be an exciting week in tournament play because of so many single-digit games. Everybody's got to show up and produce and bring what they can bring, and that gives you a chance""ù said Henrickson. Because UCSB is forced to play the highest-seeded team to advance, the Gauchos are able to rule out No. 8 Hawaii from the equation. This means that following Tuesday night's games, the Gauchos will be met by either CSU Northridge, Riverside or Long Beach in Wednesday night's matchup. During the conference season, the Gauchos split the series 1-1 with both Northridge and Riverside while defeating Long Beach in both meetings. Despite losing both regular-season games to the Gauchos, Long Beach (6-10, 8-22 overall) is on a five-game winning streak that saw the 49ers take down their scheduled opponent for Tuesday night, UC Riverside. The Highlanders (6-10, 9-21 overall), in spite of falling to Long Beach in the two teams' most recent meeting, closed out their regular season with a 76-62 win over top-seeded UC Davis, the Aggies' second loss in conference play. For Riverside, the timely win broke its three-game losing streak and saw the Highlanders' two leading scorers, senior guard Michelle Curry and redshirt senior guard Lauren Holt, combine for 43 points. While the Gauchos can rule out facing Hawaii in the second round, they know they'll play Northridge (8-8, 15-15 overall) given that the Matadors win against the Rainbow Wahine. Northridge's Channon Fluker, a junior center and the Big West Player of the Year for the second consecutive season, leads the Big West in rebounds, double-doubles, blocked shots and free throws made. The Matadors obviously rely on Fluker on both ends of the floor, as she's also averaged 18.9 points per game. On Jan. 31, Northridge defeated UCSB in the Thunderdome 48-30, a game in which Fluker had 15 points, 12 boards and 5 blocks. The Gauchos were held to their lowest field-goal percentage in program history, converting on only 20.3 percent of shots. ""úWe didn't attack, we took some ill-advised shots, but we've got to get some touches in the paint, some kick-outs and some rhythm,""ù said Henrickson. ""úWe need to execute down the stretch, get them off the glass.""ù Although the Gauchos dropped their final regular season game in Hawaii, Santa Barbara holds a determined mindset heading into the postseason. ""úIt's not who you play, it's not where you play, it's how you play,""ù continued Henrickson. ""úAnd you've got to own your how. You've got to be dialed in, you've got to know what you're doing, you've got to be disciplined. We've got to be committed to making fewer mistakes and forcing mistakes on the other end.""ù The Gauchos will face either Riverside, Long Beach or Northridge on Wednesday, March 7, with tip-off scheduled for 8:30 p.m. With a win, UCSB advances to face either UC Davis or Cal Poly in the semifinals. Games will be broadcast on ESPN3 as the Gauchos aim to return to the Championship, where they lost to Long Beach last year.

sports,Gloomy Day DoubleHeader: UCSB Welcomes FGCU for Wednesday Showdown,7-Mar-18,12:52 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-07/gloomy-day-doubleheader-ucsb-welcomes-fgcu-for-wednesday-showdown/,"When fielding a ground ball, Sammy Fabian prepares to throw to home plate. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB softball team has a lot to prove as it heads back home from the Sunshine State for a double header against Florida Gulf Coast this Wednesday. Following four disappointing losses and only a single win in the five-game Citrus Classic II, the Gauchos hope to regain some momentum and change the direction of their non-conference season thus far. With an overall record of 14-4, however, Florida Gulf Coast will be a tough team to beat for Santa Barbara, whose record stands at 8-12 overall after the rough weekend. Nonetheless, the Gauchos may have caught the Eagles at the perfect time. All four of FGC's losses happened in its most recent series at the FSU Unconquered Invitational, consequently breaking its hefty 13-match winning streak. Where the Gauchos have been notorious for both high-scoring wins and losses, the Eagles have kept their score-deficit low. In nine of their 13 wins, the team has scored five runs or less, and in 11 of the 13 wins it has kept their opponent to a score of three or below. As a result, Florida Gulf Coast's pitchers have each maintained a low ERA, cumulatively averaging 1.40. It is here that the Gauchos' .347 home-team batting and lofty .484 slugging averages will be tested. Looking to add to her 10-game hitting streak is freshman outfielder Sammy Fabian. Her now .455 batting average reigns high above the others and has proven to be a vital piece of UCSB's offensive game. Veteran infielder Sierra Altmeyer also has played a significant role in the latest series, finishing with five hits throughout the weekend. The senior doubled against Florida International and homered against Niagara on Saturday, contributing a run to the team's only win of the classic. Though it has not yet translated into many successful outcomes, Santa Barbara's lineup as a whole looks very competitive against Florida Gulf Coast's. Whereas six Gauchos have batting averages of .300 and above, the Eagles only have three. Junior Racquel Fournet seems to be the most threatening of the three, boasting 19 hits and a .352 average. A permanent member of FGC's starting lineup, the outfielder has driven in 10 runs for her teammates and has herself scored seven. Following a weekend scattered with errors, unearned runs and multiple pitching changes, the 'Chos will need to adjust their defensive game. The veteran-heavy pitching lineup includes freshman Emily Schuttish, sophomore Lilliana Rodriguez, sophomore Felisha Noriega, senior Lena Mayer, and junior Veronika Gulvin. The latter three have consistently appeared in the past games. In the five games played over the weekend, the pitching staff's ERA capped at 7.62; on the season they average a 4.33 ERA. Comparatively, Florida Gulf Coast sports an aforementioned ERA of 1.40, as none of their pitchers individually exceed 1.80. Left-handed pitcher Riley Randolph's consistency and accuracy has played a key role in the defensive success of the Eagles. The junior powerhouse leads both her own team and the Gauchos in strikeouts ""î 41 to be exact ""î and has allowed just seven walks in her seven starts throughout the preseason. Admittedly, one consistently strong pitcher like Randolph has not emerged from UCSB's bullpen quite yet. The girls have instead depended on each other on a game-to-game basis; one pitcher rarely starts and finishes an entire game. In fact, in four out of the five games of the Citrus Classic II, the Gauchos' opponents saw at least three members of the five-person pitching lineup per game. All things considered, this double header has the potential to be a pivotal transition for the 'Chos. With the comfort of home-team advantage and fans to help them out, the team can hopefully pull together their offensive and defensive games to maximize their chance to add a few wins to their record. The back-to-back games against FGC begins at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., respectively, at Campus Diamond. Tickets are $11 for visitors.

sports,Coast to Coast: Florida Gulf Coast Dominated UCSB Wednesday's Doubleheader,8-Mar-18,12:17 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/coast-to-coast-florida-gulf-coast-dominated-ucsb-wednesdays-doubleheader/,"Alyssa Diaz swings at a low strike. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following an unusually disappointing week for the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles after they went 1-4 in the Florida State University Unconquered Invitational, the trip to sunny Santa Barbara helped regain some footing as the Eagles swept the UCSB softball team in a doubleheader on Wednesday. The Gauchos, now 8-14 overall on the season, couldn't get their bats in a groove as Florida Gulf Coast showboated lights out pitching in a commanding style to blow past a struggling UCSB team. FGCU now improves to 16-4 on the season and will look to carry over that momentum into the Loyola Marymount Tournament on March 8th. First Game The Eagles' attack was spearheaded by junior southpaw Riley Randolph who wheeled and dealed in her start on Wednesday. Randolph blew past Gaucho batters and displayed a tenacity that the UCSB team was not accustomed to by tossing 6.1 scoreless innings while only allowing four hits in her sixth win of the season. After her powerful pitching performance against the ""òChos, Randolph now leads the Eagles with a 1.33 ERA on the season and sports a 6-2 record as a starter. For UCSB, junior pitcher Veronika Gulvin was credited with the loss in the first game of the day. Gulvin allowed two runs over her seven inning, complete game outing. This, however, came without any help on the offensive side of the ball as she suffered her sixth loss of the season and she now sports a 3-6 record with a 4.20 ERA on the season. Through the first four innings, the Gauchos were held hit less as the Eagles displayed end of the line defense and covered every inch of the ballpark. Freshman infielder Maci Fines broke up Randolph's no hit bid with a single in the fifth, but just as the Gauchos seemed to grasp a spec of footing, FGCU defense stepped up once again as senior catcher Samantha Lujan hit a shot to deep left field curving foul. A sure hit that could've changed the complexion of the match was taken away when Eagles senior left fielder Kelsey Huff ranged over and covered 40 feet of field to lay out and make a spectacular diving catch to nab the second out of the inning to maintain a 1-0 lead over the ""òChos. In the bottom of the seventh, the Gauchos were down by two, threatening again with the bases loaded and one out to force a pitching change. Freshman closer Taylor Bauman entered the game in relief and stopped the streaking UCSB bats in their tracks as she grabbed the final two outs of the game along with her ninth save of the season. Bauman now boasts a 0.59 ERA on the season in her freshman campaign. Second Game The Gauchos came alive in the second game of the doubleheader as sophomore starter Morgan White only lasted three innings while allowing two earned runs on four hits. She was pulled with no outs in the bottom of the fourth after a two-RBI bomb by junior second base stand-out Sierra Altmeyer who hit her first home run of the season. Freshman pitcher Marissa Mesiemore shined in relief for the Eagles posting two innings of scoreless softball and picking up the win in the process to advance her record to 7-1 on the season. After taking over and shutting down the Gauchos in the fourth, freshman shortstop Haley Morrell blasted a homer to deep center field to break the tie and put the Eagles up by one and from there FGCU pitching took over. The closer, Bauman, entered the game in the bottom of the sixth for the Eagles and completed a six-out close to finish out the back-to-back games with her second appearance of the day. Bauman also grabbed her tenth save of the season in the process. For the Gauchos, they look to bounce back after their tough back-to-back losses against FGCU as they shift gears and head to the Bay to compete in the Bulldog Classic in Fresno, California. UCSB will begin the tournament with doubleheader against Cal Berkeley and Fresno State on Friday, March 9th at†Margie Wright Diamond.

sports,Guess Who's Back? Gauchos Return to Big West Postseason,8-Mar-18,5:10 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/guess-whos-back-gauchos-return-to-big-west-postseason/,"Jalen Canty slams the ball through the hoop. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus A year ago at this time, the UCSB men's basketball team was sitting at home after a last-place finish in the Big West, watching the conference tournament kick off in Anaheim. Just one year later, the Gauchos are the second seed heading into the tournament with first-year Head Coach Joe Pasternack at the helm. UCSB returns to the Big West tourney following a 6-22, 4-12 conference finish last season. It's a remarkable turnaround, and one that seemed unlikely heading into this year's campaign. However, as things progressed and the Gauchos kept winning on their way to a 22-8 overall and 11-5 Big West regular season finish, the unlikely became reality. Such a turnaround alone would make for a successful season. Now that they're here, though, the Gauchos might as well keep things going.
The first step in that process comes on Thursday night when the team takes on Cal Poly in its first-round matchup at the Honda Center. Should the Gauchos take that game, they'll be just two wins away from the Big West title and a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Those other two games, however, aren't on UCSB's radar at all. They're focused instead on Cal Poly, as if this was any other week. ""úWe're just focused on one game at a time,""ù Pasternack said. ""úWe're treating this like a normal Thursday-Saturday week, and we're locked into this one game. We'll worry about the next one if we win [on Thursday].""ù Of course, it isn't just a normal week, no matter what Pasternack says. In a single-elimination tournament, even a game against No. 7-seeded Cal Poly has more on the line than any other game the Gauchos have played this season, but that doesn't mean the team is completely new to the bright lights. ""úWe've played on big stages this season,""ù Pasternack explained. ""úWe've played against Pitt, Texas A&M and USC, and we didn't win but we were competitive. We went to UC Davis and got a big win. Our guys are battle-tested.""ù UCSB really couldn't have asked for a better opponent than Cal Poly to kick off the conference tournament. The two teams met just this past Saturday, when the Gauchos dismantled the Mustangs 86-61 in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos had one of their best offensive games in weeks, as those 86 points were the most the team had scored since Feb. 8, along with its 27 assists going down as a season-high. ""úThat game [against Cal Poly] gave our guys a great deal of confidence. They're hungry to get back on the court,""ù Pasternack said. Max Heidegger, UCSB's leading scorer this season at 19.4 points per game, had a little bit of a bounce back game offensively against the Mustangs, something the team is hoping carries through into the tournament. The sophomore guard had 23 points, knocked down five three-pointers and shot 50 percent from the field for the first time since Jan. 17. ""úFor Max, you have to look at his complete body of work,""ù Pasternack said. ""úYou can't get caught up in his last game or his last few games. He's shooting 40 percent from three this season, and he's got the defense focused on him. He's a complete player, and he dominated on defense last game.""ù The timely return of Jalen Canty two games ago gave the Gauchos just enough time to work the talented senior big man back into the lineup. That's important for a UCSB offense that flows a lot smoother with both Canty and graduate transfer forward Leland King II attracting attention inside, and for a defense that relies on Canty's menacing rim presence. Canty's positive influence on the offensive end was obvious last Saturday against the Mustangs. Having two major inside threats forced the Cal Poly defense to pull some of their attention away from the three-point line, something that didn't happen much while the forward was out. That was key in the Gauchos' 86-point performance, which was more than enough offense given UCSB's defensive performance. The Mustangs shot just 39 percent from the field and had only two players score in the double digits. One of those players was senior guard Victor Joseph, who led the Mustangs with 14.4 points per game, and had 16 points on Saturday, good for second on the team.
Junior point guard Donovan Fields, who averaged 13.3 points per game, typically seconds Joseph but on Saturday it was Josh Martin and his 20 points that shouldered the rest of the offensive load. Cal Poly's 9-21 overall record and 4-12 record in the Big West don't do much to hype them up as a potential spoiler of UCSB's title hopes, but both recent and not-quite-as-recent history suggests they still shouldn't be taken lightly. The Gauchos suffered a last-second loss in their first Big West game of the year at the hands of the Mustangs on Jan. 4, just over two months ago, which gave Saturday's drubbing some revenge flavoring. In 2015, UCSB took on Cal Poly in the exact same 2-7 matchup in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament, and just escaped with a 54-50 victory. That tournament matchup was, of course, three years ago, and Saturday's win turned the Jan. 4 matchup into history, but both games should give any UCSB fan or player looking past the coming contest reason to reconsider. The turnaround from a year ago began with the final whistle of Big West play and the early April hiring of Pasternack. Much of the success in fact, stems from the team forgetting what exactly they were bouncing back from. ""úOur guys have just locked into the process,""ù Pasternack said. ""úThey've had a chip on their shoulder for the last ten months, but they didn't worry about last season. They've been focused on this one.""ù While Pasternack and his players may claim to be focused on just the upcoming Cal Poly game, there's no question that the whole tournament looms large. Three tournament victories, and the Gauchos can put the ultimate cap on their remarkable turnaround. UCSB takes on Cal Poly on Thursday night at 8:30 p.m. in the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament at the Honda Center in Anaheim.

Santa Barbara is currently riding a two-game winning streak and will look to keep the success going against a Long Beach State team that is 6-9 on the year. Long Beach State struggled mightily to start its season as it had lost nine of its first 10 games by an average margin of six goals. In their previous matchup at the Triton Invitational Tournament in San Diego, the Gauchos won by a score of 10-5 behind four goals from sophomore utility Sarah Snyder. Despite their early struggles, the 49ers have found recent success as of late as they went 3-1 at the Wolverine Invitational in Ann Arbor, Mich. Sophomore utility Maria Mimidi led the team with a total of six goals in the four games they played in. In its last six games, Long Beach State has averaged nine goals per game which means that UCSB must continue to be stout defensively in order to come out with a win. UCSB has seemed to have found their rhythm offensively after scoring a total of 27 goals in their past two games. ""úI think we are starting to gel a little bit better,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay said. ""úIt is an area that we need to keep improving on, which just comes with time.""ù After struggling at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational in Irvine, the 'Chos were able to regain their confidence with two wins this past weekend. ""úPart of the process is adversity and rebounding after losses,""ù Kay said. ""úIf you continue to get hit, it definitely breaks you down, so it was nice to come out with two wins.""ù
Junior utility Kate Pipkin in particular has been on a hot streak, as she netted five goals and assisted on four this past weekend at the Claremont Convergence Tournament. For the season, Pipkin has 32 goals and a team-leading 27 assists and 59 total points accumulated. ""úShe can do a little bit of everything,""ù Kay said. ""úIt just depends on who we are playing. She is a very powerful threat. When she is on, watch out.""ù Santa Barbara will also hope to rely on sophomore attacker Natalie Selin, whose five goals and four steal performance at the Barbara Kalbus Invitational led to her being picked as the Big West Player of the Week on Feb. 28. After netting four more goals this past weekend, Selin, the California native, has tallied 24 goals on the season. Moreover, freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder have started to dominate as Buck recorded 12 saves against the University of Redlands and Snyder recorded 10 saves against Pomona-Pitzer. ""úThey have done a great job,""ù Kay said. ""úThe goalies have been splitting time so Becca played the first game that day and Kenzie Snyder played the second game against Pomona. I am really proud of both of them and excited about the future.""ù Santa Barbara will look to add on to their win streak this weekend at Long Beach on March 10 as they face a red-hot 49er squad at 12 p.m. A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the March 8, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,UCSB Eliminated From Big West Tournament Following Loss to CSUN in Second Round,8-Mar-18,12:30 PM,['Kendra Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-08/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament-following-loss-to-csun-in-second-round/,"Sarah Bates looks to pass over a defender. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Last season, despite a sub-par regular season, the UCSB women's basketball team was able to rally and make it to the Big West Championship game with a chance at an NCAA berth on the line. Unfortunately, no such magic was in the works for the Gauchos this season as a 72-63 loss,which included a killer 11-0 run in the final minutes of the fourth, to CSUN late last night sent them home for the season. With the win, Cal-State Northridge advances to the Semifinals of the Big West Tournament, which will continue at the Honda Center, while Santa Barbara concludes its season with a 12-17 overall record. The game was played in Fullerton, California at the Titan Gym, and was not lacking excitement. After a slow start for Cal State Northridge, the teams slowly began trading buckets, in what was shaping up to be a thrilling game. Santa Barbara had a strict game plan, which they implemented early on. Knowing that Defensive Player of the Year, junior center Channon Fluker, is dangerous in the paint, the Gauchos were determined to contain her. UCSB came out with forceful defense to start the game, causing the Matadors to fall behind early after missing their first six shots. On fire in the first quarter and clicking on all cylinders, Santa Barbara's offense exploded. Senior forward Drew Edelman had two early baskets in the post, making her presence in the game known early. Edelman punching in her two shots, combined with senior guard Makala Roper splashing in two three-pointers in the beginning minutes, made it look as if the team was poised to run away with the victory. The Big West Tournament is not for the faint of heart, though, as the Matadors were down but not out. Despite being behind early, the stellar three-point shooting from CSUN brought them back in the game. UCSB's opponents shot 9-for-22 from beyond the arc (44.1 percent), causing a world of trouble for the unsuspecting Gauchos ""ì especially since UCSB only shot at 31.6 percent from three themselves. The ""òChos held a solid 20-13 advantage mid second quarter, but a great 17-8 rally by the Matadors before the end of the first half gave them a 30-28 lead into the break. Making second half adjustments, CSUN knew they had to allow Fluker the opportunity to make an impact if they wanted to end up victorious in the game. Feeding her as soon as halftime was over, and the third quarter began, Fluker scored four-straight points for the Matadors, and UCSB knew they had to put in work to offset her influence. The Gauchos quickly answered her challenge, when redshirt senior point guard Drea Toler responded with four points of her own ""ì and the back and forth action was alive and well. This constant trading of baskets continued up until nearly midway through the fourth quarter of regulation. All knotted up at 53-53 halfway through quarter four, CSUN edged ahead and managed to get up by four, after a pair of free throws from senior forward Tessa Boagni and a stop causing another scoring opportunity. This was a pivotal point in the game, as Santa Barbara seemingly did not have an answer and simply could not stop the bleeding. After the four points scored by Boagni, Fluker and Boagni made back-to-back baskets, as Cal State Northridge proceeded to go on a run that lasted over three minutes in the last quarter. This 11-0 run was unanswered, and the Gauchos were backed in a corner late, as the score sat at 64-53 with 2:44 remaining on the game clock. The Gauchos clawed their way back and cut the deficit to 6, on baskets from redshirt junior Sarah Porter, freshman guard Sarah Bates, and another shot by Toler; but it was not enough as CSUN hit a pair of clutch free throws to solidify the outcome of the game, regulation ending with the score at 72-63. In her last game as a Gaucho, Edelman enforced her way to yet another double-double, with an amazing 18-point, 12-rebound show. Porter also had a great game, scoring 15, and Toler ended with double digits as well, notching 13 points of her own. Boagni led CSUN with a dominating 16 points, scoring 10 of them in the fourth quarter. Freshman guard Destiny Brooks had an impressive 15 points which all came from beyond the arc, and Fluker had a double-double for her squad, as she notched 10-points and grabbed 13 boards. Santa Barbara shot at 39.1 percent in the game, on 25-for-64 shooting; while their opponents had a field goal percentage of 44.1 percent on 26-for-59 shooting. This was the final game for four seniors on the Santa Barbara roster: Edelman, Toler, Roper and small forward Chaya Durr. With the loss, one has to wonder where the ""òChos will go from here. They still have great young talent such as freshman Sarah Bates, but losing Toler, Edelman, Roper and Durr will be tough. Luckily they have all summer to figure it out.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After splitting its weekend matches on the road in Arizona, the UCSB women's tennis team will return to its home court to host both the University of Pennsylvania on Saturday and Loyola Marymount on Sunday. The Gauchos, who are currently 6-8, are returning from a brief road tour that resulted in a 4-0 victory against Arizona and a 4-0 loss to then No. 33 Arizona State the day after. UCSB experienced a slight regression in doubles play against the two teams, narrowly defeating Arizona 2-1 in doubles and falling to ASU 2-0. Penn comes into Santa Barbara with a 5-7 record and is currently on a three-match losing streak. It is now 0-1 against Big West opponents following its 4-3 loss to Long Beach State on Tuesday. The Quakers are winless on the road with an 0-3 record. LMU has been very impressive as of late as it has won six matches straight to sit at 7-2. The Lions are 3-0 against Big West teams this season with wins over Cal Poly, Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State. Despite lacking consistency in doubles play overall, the Gauchos have experienced exemplary play by their duo of seniors Natalie Da Silveira and Palina Duvabets, who recently moved up to No. 39 in ITA doubles rankings, jumping nearly 20 spots from No. 57. The pair has established an impressive four-game win streak in doubles play, which has made up for their team's struggles on the other two doubles courts. During preparation for its upcoming opponents, UCSB will look to straighten out some of the issues it has experienced in doubles play in recent matches. ""úWe obviously are very strong at one, and we need to improve the consistency at numbers two and three,""ù Head Coach Simon Thibodeau said. ""úWe have to help a few players improve their doubles skills and strategy, and we're going to work on that this week.""ù Due to a lack of success when playing from behind, UCSB will also look to improve upon certain issues that its individual players have faced in singles play, going into what will likely be a challenging weekend against Penn and LMU. ""úPenn has beat Harvard this year, and LMU beat SMU, who we just lost to, so they're going to be good matches,""ù Thibodeau explained. ""úThis week we're going to do a lot of private lessons and focus on the things that each of them need, and then collectively, we know we need to step up when it's time to compete.""ù The Gauchos will kick off their weekend at home against Penn on Saturday. UCSB will be the fourth stop for the Quakers on a grueling week-long road tour as Penn is coming off its loss to LBSU. The rigorous nature of its road tour, which includes a match against No. 2 ranked Pepperdine on Thursday, will likely put Penn at a disadvantage in its match against UCSB. ""úWe're going to see them on the fourth match of their trip, so we might have a bit of an advantage, but we have to be ready. We have six players now, so everyone needs to show up, and there's no one who can rest,""ù Thibodeau said. The next day, the Gauchos will round out their difficult weekend against a familiar opponent, Loyola Marymount. Helping Loyola ascend is in part due to outstanding play by No. 30 ranked freshman Veronica Miroshnichenko, who has gone 7-1 in dual singles matches. Miroshnichenko will also give UCSB a run for its money in doubles play, where she and fellow freshman Eva Marie Voracek stand at No. 22 in ITA doubles rankings. Despite the looming challenge of a very talented player, the Gauchos are confident in their ability to come out on top, provided they show up to play. ""úWe know them really well, they are really strong at the top of their lineup. We've beat them in the past, but now they have an improved team. I think it's very even,""ù Thibodeau said. ""úWe can win at each position but we can also lose, so it's about who competes the best on that day.""ù If UCSB comes ready to play against Penn and LMU, it could put an end to its chase of reaching the .500 mark. The Gauchos play Penn, this Saturday, March 10 at 11 a.m. and will continue their weekend with a matchup against LMU on Sunday, March 11 at 12 p.m. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the March 8, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Host Texas State Hoping to Get Back to .500,9-Mar-18,1:19 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-09/gauchos-host-texas-state-hoping-to-get-back-to-500/,"Tevin Mitchell watches the ball soar. Lianna Nakashima/Daily Nexus Following its first series win of the season over Penn State, the UCSB baseball team will hope to maintain that momentum with yet another home series at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium this time against Texas State. This is the second of the six consecutive home series Santa Barbara has over the next month and a half. The Gauchos host the Bobcats with just an 4-7 overall mark but does boast a solid 3-1 home record. The visiting team is 7-4 on the year and has played just one road game this season, against Rice University, and lost 8-6. This is the first ever match-up between these two programs. UCSB comes into this weekend with a very exciting possibility. While difficult, if it could sweep Texas State, then it would be back to an even record at 7-7 and just like that it is back to being in a power position to try to get back to good form. What will Santa Barbara need to make this happen? Simple, it will need good pitching. In their four wins this season the Gauchos have given up an average of three runs per outing. In their seven losses, they have given up 6.71 runs per game. Conversely, in wins, UCSB scores 7.35 runs while in losses it only bats in 3.3 runs per game. Overall, the key word for Santa Barbara is consistency. If it can become a more consistent team in all facets of play then it will have much more success. Being at home certainly helps a young team like them to become more consistent. At home, the ""òChos bat .307 at the plate, .394 slugging with and have a .404 on-base percentage. They also have double the RBI's at home (22) then on the road (11) despite having played one less game in Santa Barbara. Strikeouts have also been a problem for UCSB this season especially early in the season. After it's first series of the season, Santa Barbara already accumulated 35 strikeouts. Additionally, UCSB has struck out 79 times on the road compared to just 22 at home. If the point hasn't been driven home already, it is that Santa Barbara has a really good opportunity not just this weekend but in its next 18 of 19 games which will be at home. Key players that the Gauchos have relied on this season at the plate includes redshirt juniors Clay Fisher and Thomas Rowan. Despite not having been fully healed from his injury to play his normal shortstop position, Fisher has not missed a beat when up to bat. He currently slashes a very efficient .306/.340/.388. Rowan is the teams leader in batting average hitting .333 at the plate. He and Fisher are the only two Gauchos batting above .300. For Texas State, their normal Friday starting pitcher has been a beast which will make it difficult for the ""òChos to get the first victory of the series. Sophomore right-handed pitcher Nicholas Fraze currently owns a 2-1 record and has a 0.93 ERA and 18 strikeouts on the season. Senior Dylan Paul has been getting it done for the Bobcats on the offensive side of the game. Last weekend, he led the Bobcats at the plate with a .545 average (6-for-11).† The utility also added in four runs and hit a walk-off triple in the series finale. For the season, he leads the team with a†.395 (17-for-43) batting average. The 2018 Preseason All-Sun Belt Conference First Team has also batted in eight runs and holds a solid .938 fielding percentage. Santa Barbara has 18 of its next 19 games at home and so far it has taken advantage of that opportunity but it cannot stop there. UCSB is still a program on the rise despite a sub-par last season but that will not be true forever if it cannot return to its former glory. UCSB takes on Texas State in the first of a three-game series at 2 p.m. on Friday, March 9th at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Tying the school record of 23 wins in a season, the UCSB men's basketball team pummeled the Cal Poly Mustangs 75-53 in the first game of the Big West tournament. The Gauchos put on the most dominating display of the day, as even though all top seeded seeds won their quarterfinals, the other three games were decided by a combined margin of seven points.  The Mustangs ended their 2017-18 season 9-22 overall, good for a seventh place finish in the Big West conference. To call this game an absolute wire to wire blowout would be an understatement. Whether it was the fact that four out of five starters scored within the first five possessions for the Gauchos, the fact that Cal Poly did not lead a single second of this game, or even the fact that at halftime UCSB more than doubled up Cal Poly in any important offensive statistic, the first half was one of the most lopsided in tournament history.  The Gauchos were hot from the jump, as an early 9-2 lead ballooned to 30-10 about halfway through the first half. Although his box score numbers don't quite reflect it, the play of center Jalen Canty is a huge reason for the late-season revitalization of the offense.  The senior did finish the game with 10 points and 8 rebounds in 20 minutes, however those numbers don't speak to the spacing he creates by being an offensive threat down low. And it's not just the pure shooters like Heidegger and senior guard Gabe Vincent benefiting from the big man's return, in fact forward Leland King II might be the happiest to see him back out there.  In the games that Canty has been back King's assist and shooting numbers have risen rapidly, and the synergy between them could be key to maintaining a strong inside presence throughout March. In terms of defense, the Gauchos put together one of their most stifling performances of the year. In the first half they limited Cal Poly to 18 points on 24 percent shooting from the field, and the buzzer beater victory that the Mustangs pulled off in their first match-up definitely was a motivating factor. ""úWe learned about our defense,""ù Vincent said. ""úWe learned about what went wrong and what happens when we play defense the wrong way.""ù Vincent himself had two steals in the game, and his constant pressure on the Cal Poly ball-handlers caused almost all of their seven turnovers.  The senior made history on the other side of the ball, setting the record for most threes in a season with 242 and also climbing up the UCSB all-time scoring list to 10th all-time with 1,430 points. Him and the rest of the Gaucho starters were actually able to rest going into halftime up 45-18. Because of the huge lead, the second half was a great opportunity for the UCSB rotation players to get ready for the later rounds. Both guard Christian Terrell and Center Ami Lakoju were huge off the bench for the Gauchos, a great sign both for future years and the rest of this tournament.  Lakoju had a 10/10 double double and Terrell added 12 points of his own in really the first game that these two have been as aggressive off the bench. They captained the bench rotation which was on the court for most of the second half that never let the lead go below 20, and ultimately closed out the game up 22. Looking ahead, UCSB is taking on the third-ranked UCI Anteaters Friday in the semi-finals. Irvine is coming off a last second comeback victory over Hawaii in the first round, yet they can also claim an advantage over the Gauchos because of their blowout win last time these two teams met.  A big difference maker is going to be Canty, who was suspended for the last matchup between these two teams. The matchup down low with him and forward Tommy Rutherford will be big in determining who has control of the paint, something that Coach Pasternack has been emphasizing coming into the tournament.  The best record in school history and a trip to the Big West finals is on the line Friday, it's time for the Gauchos to go all out. UCSB will face UC Irvine at 9 p.m. on Saturday, March 10th at the Honda Center. The game will also be televised on ESPNU.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The regular season rolls on as the recently in-form tied for No. 14 UCSB men's volleyball team will want to continue their winning ways. This week, the Gauchos are set to host the Fort Wayne Mastodons on Friday, then a nationally ranked program in the No. 10 Ball State Cardinals on Saturday. Taking a break from conference play, these matchups will still prove just as challenging. They will also put the team's overall stamina to the test as they prepare for next week's pair of back to back Big West matches against conference and NCAA powerhouse: No. 1 Long Beach State. The Gauchos are currently at a 7-5 overall record on the year, as they are also experiencing a three-game win streak following a couple of wins over conference counterparts UC San Diego and regular season opponent USC. In terms of conference standings, UCSB's flawless 2-0 record is tied, at the moment, with Long Beach State for first place on the Big West league table. As for this week's first visitor, Fort Wayne boasts a 13-4 overall record so far through the season and is on a four- game win streak as of recent. However, their four total losses this season all come from top-10 nationally ranked NCAA programs; three of which, Ohio State, Loyola Chicago and Lewis, share the same MIVA Conference as the Mastodons. Between now and the Friday game, Fort Wayne will also travel this Wednesday to face Big West's UC Irvine, so proper on-the-road rest will be an upcoming game factor. One player to look out for on the Mastodons' side is sophomore outside hitter Pelegrin Vargas who leads his team as the only player to break two hundred kills so far at 230 on the season. His partner in playmaking, junior setter Michael Keegan, also leads Fort Wayne in assists with 485, three times more than the next runner up. The No. 10 weekend visitor, Ball State, currently holds an overall record of 10-7. Out of Santa Barbara and Fort Wayne, the Cardinals hold the longest current win streak at five in a row. They are also MIVA associates and are fourth in league rankings at 4-2, whilst Fort Wayne is fifth at 3-3. Nationally speaking, the Cardinals were previously 11th in NCAA ran kings until their bump up the leader boards. Ball State's team leaders include their trifecta of attacking production in outside attackers, sophomore Blake Reardon, sophomore Matt Szews and senior Matt Walsh. Together, the trio combines for a whopping 470 kills this season, more than half of the team total. In UCSB news, a pair of Gauchos is being recognized with Big West Player of the Week honors. Sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders is Player of the Week as his top offensive performances have him hitting .469. He also averaged a 5.43 kills per set ratio last week. Sophomore setter Randy DeWeese earns the Defensive Player of the Week award after a 1.57 in blocks and a 2.86 in digs. The Gauchos will face Fort Wayne this Friday, March 9, and Ball State this Saturday, March 10, both at 7 p.m. in the Robertson Gymnasium.

For UCSB, this is its first time finishing in fourth place this season. It has earned one-first place finish and two-second place finishes this season. The fourth-place finish was also a nice change of pace from its 16-place finish at the†John A. Burns Intercollegiate†three weeks ago. After Monday's first round, the Gauchos were 16-over par and were ranked near the bottom of the 12 teams competing. In the second round, however, UCSB shot an 8-under par 280, the best round of the tournament, to get back in contention. Sophomore Brett Bennett had the best individual finish of all the competing UCSB athletes tying for third place after shooting 2-under par 214. Junior Nick Swanson†also finished in the top-20 with a 5-over par 221 to tie for 18th place. Sophomore Matt Moomjian was right behind him shooting 7-over 223 to finish tied for 26th while senior Brandon Bauman†was 13-over par and tied for 42nd. Senior Willy Moffly†rounded out UCSB's lineup with at 15-over 231 to finish in 51st of the 72 total competing athletes. Long Beach State's junior Joe Fryer won individual medalist honors finishing 6-under par 210 putting him two shots ahead of UC Irvine's David Kim and four better than Bennett and Grand Canyon's senior Vinnie Murphy. Overall, a fourth-place finish was a solid way to end the invite especially after starting it off so poorly. Now, UCSB has no time to rest as it will take part in the Jackrabbit Invitational starting this Friday for its final invite of March. The tournament is hosted by South Dakota State in Boulder City, Nevada and will sport 15 teams including Santa Barbara. The other participating teams are†No. 21 UCLA, No. 35 UNLV, No. 70 Nevada, South Dakota, South Dakota State, Northern Illinois, Southern Illinois-Edwardsville, Weber State, Northern Kentucky, Binghamton, Creighton, Youngstown State, Detroit and Alabama State. UCSB will be expected to use the same five that it had participate in the Sac State invite.

The Gauchos seem to have begun to lose control of their non-conference season, now sporting a low 8-14 record and currently running a three-game losing streak. It is imperative the Gauchos prepare for their best game as they debut against former competitor UC Berkeley to whom they have lost to twice so far including one game racking up a lofty score of 11-0. The No. 17 Pac-12 powerhouse boasts an impressive 18-3 overall record. Though UCSB's second challenger Fresno State holds a more comparable record at 9-10, its game history contains a significantly more competitive lineup of teams including No. 3 Oregon and No. 7 Arizona. The team previously beat Notre Dame, who just last weekend dominated Santa Barbara in just five innings. The Gauchos will conclude the series against the Bulldogs as well. Cleveland State, currently boasting an 8-6 overall mark, is next in line for Santa Barbara come Saturday morning. Evident in their overall record, the team has had a slow non-conference season with only 14 games as compared to the 22 games played by UCSB. Cleveland State has lost four of its last five games, a statistic UCSB will hopefully be able to capitalize on to secure a win. Immediately after UCSB will face the 4-4 overall Monmouth University. This will be only the eleventh game for Monmouth who has evenly split their non-conference season so far against a range of small east coast teams. Perhaps Cal's all-star pitcher Kamalani Dung poses the greatest threat to Santa Barbara and the tournament as a whole in the upcoming weekend. Responsible for three attributed wins in Cal's latest tournament, the junior native of Hawaii pitched her first collegiate perfect game against the University of Texas, El Paso. Dung struck out over half of the batters she saw at the mound. Berkeley's roster is stacked with fierce forces at the plate. Their consistently strong offense has so far totaled 174 hits, averaging a .455 slugging percentage. Though new to the collegiate softball scene, Mikayla Coelho holds the team's highest batting average at .411. The outfielder has started in all 21 of the Bears' games, accumulating 30 hits in her rookie year. Fresno State's Savannah McHellon similarly leads her team in hits and averages with an outstanding 0.720 slugging average. In her 19 starts, the senior pitcher/infielder has hit six home runs, more than any batter in both UCSB's and its competitors' lineups. Neither Cleveland State and Monmouth's rosters present any unusual standout players. Barely having gotten into the season, the teams have not faced the high-caliber teams that Cal, Fresno, and even UCSB have. It is in these games that the Gauchos can hopefully begin to restore their record and regain some momentum for the rest of the non-conference slate before Big West play rolls around. In order to do so, however, the ""òChos must look to their offensive strategies. In five of the Gauchos' last games, the team's hit-count has remained at nine or below. However, as its history shows, when Santa Barbara exceeds ten hits its chances of winning are much greater. In fact, 71 percent of the time that Gauchos hit ten or more times, they win. UCSB may look to infielder Sierra Altmeyer, whose five-game hitting streak has resulted in four RBI's. In her latest appearance at the plate against Florida Gulf Coast the junior homered down the left-field line, driving in the only two runs the home team mustered that day. Only weeks away from their conference debut, the Bulldog Classic is one of the Gauchos' last shots at rebooting their non-conference record. The classic hosts a variety of competitors that will challenge Santa Barbara's strengths and weaknesses both offensively and defensively. This weekend the Gauchos play in Fresno. The classic's schedule is as follows, respectively: Friday at 2:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., Saturday double header beginning at 11:00 a.m., and Sunday at 11:30 a.m.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Starting Friday pitcher Jack Dashwood did all he could Friday afternoon to give his team an opportunity to score, turning in seven innings of work with just one run allowed, but a lack of offensive execution in scoring opportunities from the UCSB baseball teams' lineup led to the Texas State Bobcats squeaking out a 1-0 win. With the loss, Santa Barbara drops to 4-8 overall on the season and now misses on an opportunity to possibly be .500 come the end of this series if it could've pulled off a sweep. Texas State improves to 8-4 overall on the season picking up its first road win of the season. The redshirt freshman Dashwood wasted no time in taking control of the game early, allowing no hits, no base runners, and notching three strikeouts over the first four innings of the game. The southpaw was clearly dominant, getting batters to groundout when he wasn't forcing them to swing at strike three. Dashwood still looked to be in control headed into the top of the sixth despite allowing a single hit in the fifth, but the big lefty found himself in trouble after retiring the first batter he faced. Texas State junior Jacob Almendarez shot a single up the middle to reach first base who would reach second base in a tough play on a squibber down the line that would leave two men on first and second. Senior Derek Scheible certainly capitalized on what was perhaps Texas State's only scoring opportunity, sending a shot into left field which brought Almendarez home from second base. Dashwood would pitch a clean 7th inning, before being pulled before the 8th to end his night. The bottom of the 7th was where the Gauchos found themselves the closest to home they would get during the game. The Bobcats quickly retired the first two batters in the inning, but the team would load the bases after a trio of batters were either hit by pitch or walked. Sophomore Eric Yang approached the plate looking to pick up the necessary RBI's for the lead, but the catcher would strikeout swinging to end the threat from UCSB. The Gauchos put together an exciting two-out bottom of the 9th, when Jason Willow and Marcos Castanon each singled off of Bobcat reliever Cam Baird. Tevin Mitchell would take off to first after striking out swinging where a bobble from the Texas State catcher and a throw from his knees that enough to beat Mitchell who was called out at first on the last play of the game. Prior to starting Friday's game, Dashwood struggled in his previous three starts where the southpaw allowed at least 3-plus earned runs, 6-plus hits, and 1-plus home runs. Also noteworthy before today's game, Dashwood had not pitched past the sixth inning and only had 7 strikeouts on the season. Scheible's lone RBI of the game was the senior's team-leading 12th RBI of the season. The senior has been just a part of the prime offensive contributors for the Bobcats so far this season. The trio of Almendarez, Ortega, and Schieble each have 11+ hits on the season and their combination in the lineup clearly made an impact in the game. The big lefty responded well to his prior challenges, marking the first time he did not feature the same imperfections present on his stat sheet as previously mentioned. Should Dashwood continue in this newfound direction of success, he looks to be a key part of the Gauchos' pitching rotation as they continue this season. The Gauchos will play the midway game of the weekend series against the Texas State Bobcats on Saturday, March 10th at 2 p.m. Editor's note: Due to poor weather conditions the match scheduled for March 10th at 2 p.m. will be played on Sunday, March 11th in a doubleheader.

The in-form squad came to play right from the very first whistle as it bested the visiting Mastodons by a clean sweep, 3-0. With the victory, Santa Barbara has now won four-straight matches with the last two being shutouts and pushes its overall record to an impressive 8-5 mark. The loss dropped Fort Wayne to 14-4 overall on the season. Hopes were high that the Gauchos would be able to continue their winning ways through this week, but the mindset was still as focused as ever considering the match-ups at hand. ""ú[Fort Wayne] just beat UC Irvine, who is No. 3 in the country, so they're going to be good. They're always a well coached team, and always do a great job,""ù Head coach Rick McLaughlin said. ""úThey play fast, really a few fast sets to the pins and we just cannot get caught sleeping.""ù As expected, the first set got off to a quick and intense start. Luckily, the Gauchos were able to match this pace of play and keep the score line tight throughout the majority of play. Then, in about almost an hour into play, the game remained level at 25-25 with Fort Wayne in charge of possession. A service error on the Mastodons behalf set up UCSB to then take it all on the final rally, as the final deciding point was earned off clutch blocks by sophomore outside hitter Roy McFarland and junior middle blocker Connor Drake. Up 1-0, the always vital second set became the closest one of the night as each team passed the 30-point mark. It was once again even all around as several lead changes were experienced and the biggest point difference through it all was only three. UCSB's sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders had six kills in this set alone. In the end, it would be McFarland once more and his pair of set ending kills that would earn UCSB the 33-31 victory in the second. The third and final set went away from the earlier norm as it turned one-sided very quickly. The Gauchos would run away with this one early on as a 7-0 sprint following the start would keep them at a cozy lead throughout the rest of the set. 25-13 was the final score on the lasr set as UCSB posted yet another clean sweep and extended its winning streak to currently four games. ""úThe goal for us is to serve tough, and get their pass off the net so they can't run the offense that want to run,""ù previously said by UCSB's head coach; and that they did as the Gauchos are still historically undefeated against Fort Wayne, 3-0, in the Rick McLaughlin era. An even tougher opponent is now on the way to Santa Barbara as the NCAA's No. 10 team in the nation, Ball State, is set to make their first ever appearance versus UCSB. Santa Barbara will host the Cardinals for the last game this week on Saturday, March 10th, at 7 PM in the Robertson Gymnasium.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's tennis team stayed unbeaten at home on the season after their 6-1 drubbing of Boise State on Sunday. After their away match against Loyola Marymount got cancelled on Saturday due to inclimate weather, the Gauchos were able to direct their full attention to the Broncos""ì a team that has struggled so far this season, entering the game with a 3-8 record. Santa Barbara came out firing in doubles, with the pairing of Sophomore Joseph Guillin and Freshman Viktor Krustev winning 6-0 on court three. On court one, Juniors Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno De Alboran jumped out to an early 3-0 lead, in large part behind the strong net play from the two. However, their opponents slowly fought back, eventually bringing the score to 5-4. But behind some strong serving from Moreno De Alboran, the Gauchos were able to clinch the set as well as the doubles point to take a 1-0 advantage. ""úWe definitely took charge of the match right away,""ù Senior captain Simon Freund said. ""úWe were able to cruise through the doubles matches and take that into the singles matches.""ù From the outset of the singles matches, it was clear that UCSB was determined to dominate their opponent as much as possible. On three of the six singles courts, the Gauchos took the first set by a score of 6-0. As has been the case all season for the Broncos, they struggled to pick up victories on the higher courts. On court one, after winning his first set 6-0, Moreno De Alboran continued to harrass his opponent, using his signature forehand shot to send him scattering ball after ball. His opponent ultimately retired due to injury in the second set, giving Santa Barbara a 2-0 victory. On court three, in only his second match back from injury, Freund looked to be back to his old self. He dominated his opponent, winning the first set 6-0 and the second set 6-1 in order to give the Gauchos a 3-0 lead and put them on the verge of victory. ""úI've been getting better and better at working around the injury,""ù Freund said. ""úI've even had a higher serving percentage since getting back from my injury.""ù UCSB clinched the victory when Guillin won his match on court two in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1. Per usual, Guillin seemed to be one step ahead of his opponent throughout the match, and frustrated his opponent by picking on his weaknesses. The win moves Guillin to 11-1 on the season, and gives him a ten game winning streak in singles despite having played his last two matches at the number two spot. Even after the match was already clinched for UCSB, Holm and Krustev picked up dominant victories on courts four and five, respectively, in order to boost their confidence heading into a tough match on Tuesday against LMU. ""úEven though we might not have played the best team, it's always nice to win with authority,""ù Freund said. ""úIt builds a lot of confidence when you roll like we did.""ù With the victory, Santa Barbara now moves to 7-5 on the season, while Boise State drop to 3-9. In addition, UCSB remains unbeaten at home on the season with an overall home record of 6-0. ""úOne of our goals is to stay unbeaten at home, so I guess we're all extra hungry to keep that streak alive,""ù Freund said. The Gauchos now turn their attention to No.36 LMU, who they will face on Tuesday following their rained out match over the weekend. Once again, UCSB will be looking for their first road victory of the season in that match, as well as a victory against a top-tier team.

sports,UCSB Eliminated from Big West Tourney by UCI,11-Mar-18,10:57 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-11/ucsb-eliminated-from-big-west-tourney-by-uci/,"Jarriesse Blackmon shoots the ball over a defender. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Falling just short of the Big West Tournament championship game, the UCSB Men's basketball team lost Friday night 61-58 against the UC Irvine Anteaters. The loss in the semi-finals brought the Gauchos incredible turn-around season to an end, however this team certainly established their place in UCSB history. They ultimately finished 23-9 on the year, tying the school record for most wins in a season. Irvine moved up to 18-16 after the victory and are now set to take on Cal State Fullerton in the tournament finale. The game was back and forth for almost the entirety of the first half, as neither team held a lead larger than five until the Gauchos went on a streak with a couple minutes to go. Sophomore Max Heidegger did most of the heavy lifting on offense for UCSB. The guard scored 15 of his 18 points in the first half en-route to leading both teams in scoring and getting his first All-Tournament First Team selection. While he cooled down in the second half, as the game went on the spacing that his three point shooting created opened lanes in the interior that both Leland King II and Jalen Canty took advantage of. The Anteater's only double digit scorer in the first half was guard Max Hazzard, who was one of the best shooters in the conference this season. The sophomore notched 10 points in the half and knocked down back to back buckets with six minutes to go to give Irvine their largest lead of the night, before the Gauchos closed the half on a run to go up 37-35 at halftime. Both teams struggled to create offense throughout the second half, but again the Gauchos built up a little cushion early on. Senior Jalen Canty was a force in the paint for UCSB, he officially got 3 blocks in the half but changed countless more shots. He also pulled down six rebounds, establishing his presence inside on both side of the court. The center succumbed to the same problem as the rest of the starters later on however, which was not knocking down makeable shots. No Gaucho shot over 33% in the second half, and while Irvine did play great defense a lot of the misses were open. †Because of a lack of consistency on offense for the Gauchos, the Anteaters were able to hang around even with shooting problems of their own. ""úWe got some pretty good looks. Sometimes shots don't fall. That's just how basketball works sometimes. It happens, but we competed,""ù Forward Leland King pointed out postgame. ""úThat's all you can care about and worry about because offense is gonna be there sometimes and sometimes it's not.""ù When the offense isn't there it becomes that much more important for the team to make it up in rebounds and second chance opportunities, both areas that the Gauchos couldn't succeed at. In the second half Irvine out-rebounded UCSB by 4, and won the overall battle 40-38. One of the most worrying statistics was the fact that the Gaucho bench was outscored 31-1 in the game. Because four of five starters aren't returning next year, it's going to be vital for some of the younger players to gain confidence going into next season. Even with all the shooting struggles, the game came down to the final few possessions. After Heidegger went one for one from the line with 2 minutes to go, sophomore guard Essayu Worku came down to the other end and hit a jumper to put the Anteaters up 61-58 with 45 seconds to go. Senior Gabe Vincent couldn't knock down a three-pointer on the left wing in the next possession, and the Gauchos opted not to foul Irvine on defense. This actually gave UCSB the last shot of the game which was a desperation heave by guard Marcus Jackson that clanked off the rim. This certainly was a disappointing loss for one of the best basketball teams in school history. The Gauchos were looking at a potential 14 seed in the NCAA tournament if they had gone all the way, and it could have been a storybook ending for the veteran squad. Instead they won't be in the Big Dance, but that shouldn't take away form the amazing year that this team had. While they couldn't make it to March Madness, this team brought new life to the Thunderdome and UCSB in general, and they'll always have that.

sports,Gauchos End 5-Game Stretch With a 2-3 Finish at Bulldog Classic,12-Mar-18,12:16 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/gauchos-end-5-game-stretch-with-a-2-3-finish-at-bulldog-classic/,"Alyssa Diaz swings at a low strike. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus March hasn't been too kind to the UCSB softball team. Current owners of a 10-17 record, UCSB has lost nine of its last twelve games in March as it heads into its break as student-athletes focus on ending the quarter with final exams. The Gauchos spent the weekend competing in the Bulldog Classic in Fresno, CA, as they split their tournament, finishing the stretch of games with a 2-3 mark. The Gauchos are now 10-17 overall. On Friday, the Gauchos kicked off their Bulldog Classic competition with a double header against the Cal Berkeley Bears, boasting a 20-3 record, in the afternoon, before matching up with the Fresno State Bulldogs,11-10, in the evening. Redshirt Junior pitcher Zoe Conley came out as a commanding ace against the ""òChos, allowing zero earned runs throughout her 5-inning complete game, improving to 9-3 on the year with this 12-2 mercy victory against Santa Barbara. UCSB bats had no answer for the sheer dominance displayed by Conley, but while their hitting struggles were aggravatingly obvious, the Gauchos pitching was gruelingly worse. The bears got off to a hot start against Junior pitcher Veronika Gulvin as they flashed two doubles out of the gate to take a 1-0 lead. Gulvin was pulled with two outs in the first after an error by junior shortstop Melanie Menor and a single to left field from the next batter. She allowed four runs, three of which were unearned, picking up her seventh loss of the season, now sporting a 3-7 record. The latter half of the day didn't bode over any better for the ""òChos as they dropped their second blowout loss of the day, this time against Fresno State University by a score of 8-0. The Bulldogs shut down Gaucho hitting to a bare minimum as they shutout UCSB over the six-inning mercy match only allowing a single hit, which came in the top of the fifth inning as senior catch Samantha Lujan hit a single up the middle to center field. Senior right handed pitcher Savannah Mchellon was lights out for the Bulldogs improving her record to 1-1 on the season with her one hit shutout. Saturday brought a sliver of hope for the Gauchos as they played their second doubleheader in as many days, this time around, however, Santa Barbara took on the Monmouth University Hawks. UCSB split the series with the Hawks after losing the first game of the day by a score of 12-4. The ""òChos bounced back with a 6-3 victory of their own, snapping a six-game losing skid, and in turn introduced a little life into their bats again. After minimal damage through the first three innings, Lena Mayer allowed a double and a walk to give way to a two-out rally. Meyer was pulled with two down in the fourth for sophomore pitcher Felisha Noriega. Noriega endured a couple of poor outings over the weekend, including a relief appearance in the fourth in which she walked the bases loaded and then allowed two back-to-back singles which drove in four runs and opened the game up for the Hawks. Senior righty Lena Mayer was accredited with the loss, dropping her record to 3-5 on the year. On the other side of the ball, senior pitcher Amanda Riley got the win for Monmouth in the first matchup of the day from her 5 inning, 4 run performance, advancing her record to 4-2 on the season. The highlight of the weekend came with the second game of the day as freshman pitcher Emily Schuttish took the mound for her second start of the season. Schuttish allowed only one earned run on 9 hits over her 7-inning complete game appearance and improved her record to 1-0 on the year. The Gauchos batted around in their third inning rally as they scored six runs, topped off by a one-out, 2 RBI blast to deep right center field by sophomore first baseman slugger Alyssa Diaz, her fourth home run on the year. Santa Barbara's second Saturday outing got the bats rolling as the Gauchos carried over their powerful hitting parade onto Sunday morning when UCSB overcame the Cleveland State University Vikings by a score of 7-4, extending their win streak to two games to cap off the Bulldog Classic. Heading into the top of the fourth down by 1, the Gauchos came alive once again and dropped in four runs on five hits in the inning. Senior Samantha Lujan tied up the game with a one out, RBI single to center field. Two batters later, freshman outfielder Alyssa Latzatin busted the game wide open with a 3 RBI double to deep left center field. After a couple of poor outings earlier in the weekend, sophomore Felisha Noriega bounced back with a relief win of her own as she advanced her record to 3-5 on the season. Senior right handed pitcher Mackenzie Joecken picked up her third loss of the season for Cleveland State as her record dropped to 4-3 this season. The end of the Bulldog Classic brought two much needed wins for UCSB as the team heads into a two week break while students focus on their end of the quarter finals. As the ""òChos picked up their second and third wins in March, their record advances to 10-17 on the season heading into the twelve-day break. The two-week gap commences on Friday, March 23 as UCSB hosts the Gaucho Classic II and kicks off the tournament with a doubleheader against Cal State Bakersfield and St. Mary's College.

sports,UCSB Continues Win Streak Over Ball State,12-Mar-18,11:23 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/ucsb-continues-win-streak-over-ball-state/,"Grady Yould dives forward to keep the ball in play. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After five total wins in a row, and three of which were clean sweeps, the Gauchos are now officially on fire. Their fine form and recent string of dominant performances are now beginning to cement their status as a top 15 men's volleyball program in the nation. Considering their most recent conquest was against a top 10 team, this helps their case for elite play even more. On Saturday night, No. 14 UCSB hosted No. 10 Ball State for a non-league matchup as the two schools met historically for the first time. Ultimately, it would be the home side that would come out on top as the Gauchos bested the Cardinals after an entertaining encounter which resulted in a 3-0 clean sweep. Heading into the weekend's matchup, head coach Rick McLaughlin had this to say, ""úthey're a different team than IPFW, since they focus on different players, they set their opposite more rather than their outsides. So they're a little bit different and their offenses are a little bit different, but we'll be ready for them. We have good film and we'll do our studying.""ù Quite clearly, this was the Gauchos' show as the visiting Cardinals never found their rhythm throughout it all. Ball State kept it fairly close in the first half of the first set, but a five point run in favor of the host soon had UCSB up 20-9. A flurry of service errors and defensive mistakes by the visitors would then grant the 1st set win to the Gauchos by a score of 25-13. The second set started off with a 6-1 sprint by UCSB, but Ball State would soon quell that momentum by the halfway mark. Unfortunately, it appeared that the visitors' timeouts weren't very beneficial as they once again allowed the Gauchos to recollect themselves and go on yet another run. Improvements were made, but the Cardinals dropped the set again which resulted in a 17-25 loss. The third and final set proved to be the closest and most competitive one of the night as Ball State almost always kept it within 4. Still, the errors never stopped mounting and plays abruptly vanished at and away from the net. Overall, the passing was never quite there for the Cardinals throughout the matchup, and UCSB made them pay for it every time as they earned the final 25-19 set which wrapped up the clean sweep. Final stat tallies showed the difference in quality as UCSB hit for .329 whilst Ball State was subpar at .071; the ace count was also very one sided as the former put up 8 to the latter's 0. Gaucho sophomore middle blocker Keenan Sanders had a game leading 14 kills on the night, and sophomore libero Grady Yould had 9 of the team's 35 total digs. Tune in next week when Big West Conference play returns, as the Gauchos take on No. 1 Long Beach State in back to back 7 PM meets starting on the road this Thursday, March 15th, and then at home on Friday, March 16.

sports,UCSB vs Texas St. Results in 4-4 Tie,12-Mar-18,11:39 AM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-12/ucsb-vs-texas-st-results-in-4-4-tie/,"Luke Andrews pitches to the batter. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Immediately following its loss in the first of Sunday's scheduled games, the UCSB baseball team attempted to salvage the final game of the series but were unable to push the go-ahead run in the latter innings of the game as both teams benefitted from quality relief appearances which kept the score all tied up at 4 by the time the game was called in the 8th inning. Taking the mound for UCSB was redshirt junior RHP Chris Clements who was able to get out of a jam with a man on third by forcing infielder Jaylen Hubbard to ground out to third base. Texas State's sophomore RHP Zachary Leigh was not so lucky to escape his inaugural inning unscathed, as the one hit he allowed in the first frame was a deep shot to left which was good for Andrew Martinez's second home run of the season. It didn't take long for the Bobcats to put up their own equalizing run on the board in the top of the second. After a walk and single allowed by Clements, the run was brought home from third on a scoring sacrifice fly tying the game at one a piece. UCSB had their biggest offensive inning in the second where five runners each reached base. Leigh quickly allowed the bases to be loaded after Sam Cohen and Jason Willow each singled and Michael McAdoo was walked. The bases-loaded pressure clearly rattled the Bobcat's starter, as evidenced by the two more walks he would allow, and essentially gave UCSB an effortless 3-1 lead once the Bobcats made the final out. Similar to the first inning, the Gauchos' redshirt junior allowed the first batter he faced on base and was unfortunately never able to recover for the rest of the 3rd inning. The runner was subsequently able to get around to third on a two-out single to Jaylen Hubbard where he was finally brought home on a single to left by senior Luke Sherley. The Bobcats would put up another run in the frame off of a bases clearing, double by freshman John Wuthrich to give his team the lead 4-3. The extra-base blow was too much for Clements as he was pulled with one out remaining in the inning in exchange for Luke Andrews in relief. Leigh would go on to allow two hits in the fourth inning, giving the Gauchos the run they needed to tie the game at 4-4. The game would subsequently be called in the 8th inning as a tie, due to a travel regulation for the visiting team. The appearances by Luke Andrews and Chris Troye always kept UCSB in the game, as both pitchers were able to absolutely stifle the Texas State batters who could not come up with an answer to the Gaucho bullpen. From just before the third inning until the end of the game the two relievers would pitch a combined two-hitter with seven strikeouts. Not to be outdone the Bobcat bullpen was equally stellar in their relief appearances as three reliever hurled their own two-hitter after the fourth inning. The bullpens four innings of work preserved the lead for their team as starter Zachary Leigh's struggles nearly became too much for Texas State to recover from. The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play their next game at home against Dartmouth University Wednesday, March 14 at 3 p.m. PST.

sports,The Time is Now: Gauchos Will Attempt to Pull Off Upset Of No. 1 LBSU,15-Mar-18,12:25 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-15/the-time-is-now-gauchos-will-attempt-to-pull-off-upset-of-no-1-lbsu/,"This week is sure to be an exciting spectacle as the UCSB men's volleyball team will visit No. 1 Long Beach State on Thursday. The Gauchos will play host to the 49ers the following day. These next couple of games are also back-to-back Big West Conference matchups, as both schools will be fighting for the first place position in the league table standings. The Gauchos win streak still currently stands at five in a row, as the team will work to the best of their abilities to keep their momentum alive. The last time UCSB faced the same opponent in back to back days was against BYU, whom they split the meetings evenly with at a sweep win and sweep loss of 3-0. Nationally speaking, the Gauchos are on the rise as they were just recently bumped up two spots, from No. 14 to No. 12, in the NCAA rankings. Santa Barbara will continue to look towards their sophomore setter Randy DeWeese, who has been playing lights out as of recent considering both his offensive and defensive contributions. In terms of standout performances last week, junior middle blocker Connor Drake was recognized as the Big West Defensive Player of the Week for his blocking, as well as hitting, work against Fort Wayne and No. 10 Ball State. As for the opposite side of the court, the 49ers have been almost flawless all season long. Long Beach State is currently undefeated through 17 games and have literally only given up 3 sets to their opponents throughout it all. This will easily be the Gauchos' toughest challenge so far into the season, but it would also prove to be their greatest feat if they manage to topple, according to NCAA poll rankings, the current best men's volleyball program in the nation. Players to look out for would be their dynamic attacking duo in junior opposite Kyle Ensing and junior outside hitter TJ DeFalco. They are both nearing that 200-kill mark on the season as they remain almost even at 192 and 191 respectively. In particular, DeFalco's production is standout even on the Big West league level as he is the statistical first place leader in the hitting percentage category, with an average of .422; Ensing follows nearby at fourth place with a .398 average. Historically speaking, these two programs have been locked in heated competition as the Gauchos barely lead at 50-47. However, as of recent years, Long Beach State has displayed elite levels of play and has currently beaten UCSB in their past 4 matchups; their most recent victory resulting in a 3-0 clean sweep at Santa Barbara. UCSB and Long Beach State are both currently sitting tied, at 2-0, atop the Big West Conference standings. Plenty will be on the line this week as win streaks and league dominance will start to come into question. Tune in Thursday, March 15, as the Gauchos will be on the road versus the 49ers, then again on Friday, March 16, where reverse fixture match will be hosted at Santa Barbara's Robertson Gymansium. Both matches will be set to start at 7 PM sharp.

sports,March Sadness? Pre-Tourney Regional Predictions I Thought Were Safe,20-Mar-18,12:45 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-20/march-sadness-pre-tourney-regional-predictions-i-thought-were-safe/,"One reason I love March Madness so much is the sheer unpredictability. No one knows what's going to happen. I can't tell you how many articles I've read over the years that ""úclaim""ù to have all the answers for your bracket. No matter how much research you do, no matter how much you think you know about college basketball, you won't get a perfect bracket. Sorry. I'm not going to claim to have any definite answers here; I've been making brackets since age seven, and I can't even tell you how many years someone who has no knowledge of basketball has beaten me. What I do aim to do, however, is to break down each region, and at least tell you what to look for in the incredible time that is March Madness. With the Sweet 16 set to begin on Thursday, March 22, my reasoning for not having any ""údefinite answers""ù should speak for itself. Man, UMBC!? Who would have have ever thought? Not to mention the other upsets that have taken place within this past week. Update: Like many of my fellow March Madness viewers, my bracket is busted. All I can say is wow. Just one of my Final Four picks from below remains. With that being said, welcome to March Sadness.  Anyways, without further ado ""¶ here was my take heading into the start of the NCAA Tournament. Is there anyway I can get a redo? Photo courtesy of bleacherreport.com East region Favorite: No defense can stop Villanova. They lead the nation in points per game, coming into the tournament averaging a cool 87.1 ppg""ì and that's in the Big East, by no means a weak conference this year. Their offense runs through veteran Jaelin Brunson, who played a key role in ""òNova's championship two years ago. One of the most efficient players in the nation, Brunson averages 19 points a game on only 13 shots a game, and has 2.5:1 turnover to assist ratio. Junior wing Mikal Bridges helps shoulder some of the load as well, scoring 18 points a game for a team that shoots almost 40 percent from the three point line. In fact, the Wildcats have scored at least 71 points in every game this season. Cinderella Story Pinch me if you've heard this one before: Stephen F. Austin. As a 14 seed, picking them has a chance to backfire in my face very, very hard. But the Lumberjacks are 28-6 on the season, and it was just two years ago that they knocked off VCU in an overtime thriller. SFA has the ability to disrupt a team's offense, leading the NCAA in turnovers created per game, and take on a Texas Tech team that seems to have peaked too early in the season. There's the potential Keenan Evans goes off for the Red Raiders, but I'd bet on the Lumberjacks here. Dark Horse I think the two potential dark horses in this bracket come from the top half: 8th seeded Virginia Tech and 4th seeded Wichita State. Purdue should run through the bottom half of this bracket, given their size advantage over the other teams. If Virginia Tech can get past Collin Sexton and Alabama in the first game, they have the chance to make some noise against ""òNova. Virginia Tech has already beaten Virginia, UNC, and Duke this season,and while they struggled at times against inferior competition, they could give the Wildcats a run for their money. If Wichita State can navigate past ""úPress Virginia""ù, they could also find themselves in a heated battle with Villanova. One of the most efficient teams in the nation, they are led by Point Guard Landry Shamet, who is averaging five assists per game and shooting 46 percent from beyond the arc. Gregg Marshall has proven in the past that the Shockers aren't scared of any opponent, and with their balanced offensive attack (83 ppg), they're one of the few teams in the field that can keep up with ""òNova. My pick: Despite the hurdles of Wichita State and Virginia Tech, I think Villanova just has too much firepower. Purdue has a size advantage, but the Wildcats will be too quick and explosive. West Region Favorite: In my opinion, the West is far and away the weakest region, led by the worst number one seed, Xavier. Guard Trevon Bluiett is a bonafide star, averaging nearly 20 points per game, and has a balanced attack behind him in which seven other players average at least seven points a game. Xavier only lost five games all season in a tough Big East, and two of those losses came at the hands of Villanova. They can score, and they can score in bunches. What worries me the most about Xavier is their subpar defense""ì they give up almost 75 points a game, quite a bit for a team on the one line. † Cinderella Story Sure, I'm biased, but don't be surprised if San Diego State makes a run in the tournament. The Aztecs have won nine games in a row, and just throttled a ranked Nevada team in the Mountain West tournament. While they lack a true star, Senior Guard Trey Kell has played outstanding of late, and San Diego State's depth at the guard position allows them to not turn the ball over late. In addition, this team has proved they can play with anyone, beating Gonzaga earlier in the year. Don't be surprised if they beat Houston in the first round, and give Michigan a run for their money in the second round. Dark Horse Speaking of the ""òZags, don't be surprised if they make yet another push late into March Madness. The key to this team is their balanced attack: at least five players average double digits. Senior forward Johnathan Williams can defend almost any position, and this team brings a heavy dose of experience to the table following their run last year. Averaging 84.5 points per game, don't be surprised if this team knocks off Xavier. My pick One team that we haven't talked about yet is last year's national champion: North Carolina. Powered by senior guard Joel Berry and junior forward Luke Maye, the Tar Heels are an experienced bunch that can easily make a deep run, despite their ten losses this season. Maye has been outstanding this season, averaging a double-double, and the experience of Berry means that UNC will be able to withstand close games. I'm not entirely infatuated with them""ì they ranked ninth in the ACC in three point percentage, and lack depth beyond their two stars. But in this weak region, I think they'll advance. South Favorite: The favorite in this region, and frankly the entire tournament,is Virginia. The Cavaliers play by far the best defense in the tournament, giving up less than 54 points per game. They are also efficient, if unspectacular, on the offensive end, putting up about 68 points per game. This UVA team is 31-2, and is able to control the pace of the game, slowing it down and making their defense the focal point of the game. A potential concern, however, is their lack of a true number one scoring option. Guard Kyle Guy averages about 13 points per game, and they don't have someone who can truly take over the game if they need to get a basket at the end of the game. Cinderella Story While it wouldn't shock me if Davidson knocks off Kentucky, my cinderella in this region is a Loyola-Illinois team that has been absolutely dominant the entire season. Coming in at 28-5, including a shocking victory over a very solid Florida team, the Ramblers have the make of a team that could make waves in the tournament. They have one of the top defenses in college basketball, giving up only about 62 points per game. On offense, they have four players that average over 10 points a game, and they each shoot greater than 50 percent from the floor. This efficient team will give fits to Miami in the first round, who will be without their star guard Bruce Brown. Look for the Ramblers to rumble on to the second round. Dark Horse It feels wrong to call such a celebrated program a dark horse, but, on the four line this season, my pick is the Arizona Wildcats. ""òZona is led by freshman phenom Deandre Ayton, widely projected to be the top pick in this years NBA draft. In the pac-12 tournament, Ayton hammered his opponents, combining for 64 points and 32 rebounds in the last two games. No, that was not a typo. The program had to deal with the adversity of the FBI findings earlier in the year, but that seemed to actually bring the team together, given how well they performed in the tournament. An explosive offensive team, Arizona can beat anybody. My pick Building on that, I think Arizona will pull off the upset here and knock off both Virginia and Cincinnati. As I mentioned before, Virginia and Cincinnati are both plodding teams that control the tempo of the game and lock down their opponents. I think Arizona will speed up the game through sophomore guard Alonzo Trier, and will force both teams to score. In the end, their offenses will let them down, and in his (likely) last year at Arizona, Sean Miller will finally make the final four. Midwest Favorite: It's hard to pick a favorite in such a top-heavy region, but on paper at least, the favorite is Kansas. Kansas is led by Senior guard Devonte Graham, who averages more than 17 points per game. That being said, this Jayhawk team has more cracks than most Bill Self teams. They've lost multiple times at Allen Fieldhouse this season""ì unheard of for a Kansas team, and how far they go depends on the health of their †sophomore center, Udona Azubuike. He is expected to be ready for their tournament opener, but he will need to be at full health for the Jayhawks to make a run. Cinderella Story One of the more popular upset picks this year is 12 seed New Mexico State, and for good reason. Historically, 12 seeds have the best chance of upsets""ì in the past five years, 10 different 12 seeds have won their first round game. But this Aggie team in general spells danger for Clemson, and even potentially Auburn. Senior guard Zach Lofton averages nearly 20 points a game, and could be a starter for most major programs. NMSU is 28-5 on the season, and their 38 ranking in BPI proves they can hang with anyone in the country. Clemson has struggled of late, going 6-5 since their star senior Donte Grantham went down with a torn ACL. And if they can get past the Tigers, Auburn has lost four of their last six games. Also, while I don't expect them to win, Penn is rated as one of the best 16 seeds of all time. They went 24-8 in the Ivy League, and shoot a high percentage from behind the arc. Of course, a 16 seed has never beaten a one, but they hold the best chance of anyone in the field to do so. Dark horse: There's no real dark horse in this incredibly top-heavy group. Kansas, Duke, and Michigan State all feature balanced and extremely talented teams, but all of the other top seeds in this region are inherently flawed (see above for Clemson and Auburn). TCU has struggled after being ranked in the top ten earlier in the year, and both Rhode Island and Oklahoma have played incredibly mediocre basketball of late. No matter how much Trae Young does, it won't matter unless the team looks like they want to play. That wasn't the case in the Big 12 tournament, and it's unlikely to be the case now. My pick This region is really a coinflip for me. This Kansas team isn't as good as Kansas teams of the recent past, especially last year's team with Frank Mason. Marvin Bagley could easily put Duke on his back, but they will only go as far as senior leader Grayson Allen will take them. He has been too inconsistent this year to trust him this year against both Michigan State and Kansas. When all is said and done, I think the Spartans will advance out of the region. Sophomore Miles Bridges plays with an IQ well beyond his age, and averages 17 points a game to lead the team. Freshman standout Jaren Jackson Jr., a likely lottery pick, has been able to dominate down low at times this year. And point guard Cassius Winston provides a steady hand at the point guard position, averaging seven assists a game compared to just over 2 turnovers a game. Ultimately, Tom Izzo will find a way to guide MSU to the final four.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus It was a rough week, but a learning experience nonetheless for the UCSB men's volleyball program. A pair of Big West Conference matches was on the agenda this past week as the Gauchos faced off against Long Beach State, the NCAA's top ranked team in the nation. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara's previous five-match win streak was cut short following its two matchups against the Beach.† Both appearances didn't go according to plan for the thriving Gauchos, as the pair of matches resulted in consecutive losses. The first set of match one on Thursday featured a shell-shocked visiting side in the Gauchos, as they found themselves down 4-10 quickly by their first timeout whistle. A few service errors and overall defensive mistakes on behalf of UCSB would eventually be their downfall as the set ran away from them with the final score of 17-25. The second set of day one was by far the closest of the night as the Gauchos kept the score always within a few scores as they found themselves nearly level at 17-18. Unfortunately, the 49ers would return to their proper defensive rhythm and allow the visitors only 2 more kills to their 7 scores; thus earning them the 25-19 result and a 2-0 lead. Early on it appeared the last set of Thursday night would be close as well once the teams found themselves tied at 3-3. However, Long Beach State had something to say about that as they then went on a 6 point run. That spur of momentum would then carryout through the remainder of the set as the hosts never lost that several point buffer. At another 25-19 result, the 49ers had secured the 3-0 sweep at home. Day 2 appeared much more promising at first as the Gauchos would take the early 1-0 lead following a thrilling 26-24 performance. The second set would once again then evade the Gauchos as they'd go on to lose 15-25, bringing the set count even at 1-1. Waves of errors and never really finding an offensive rhythm would then hinder the hosts in the third set as well, as UCSB would drop another by a result of 14-25. Ending on a high note, the Gauchos arguably played their best of both nights in their final set against the 49ers. In this one, UCSB lead for up until the halfway mark of the night. Still, the Long Beach State attacking talents of junior opposite Kyle Ensing and junior outside hitter TJ DeFalco were just too much in the end and lead their team to a closely narrow 25-20 win; thus allowing the 49ers a 3-1 match win, showing that there's both plenty of good and bad that UCSB must still review in order to compete with the nation's No. 1 side. Following this pair of results, UCSB are now at a 9-7 overall on the season. In terms of conference standings, the Gauchos are now split at 2-2; this now places them tied for third in the Big West, alongside league opponent CSUN whom they'll play their next pair of conference matchups against. UCSB also still retains its No. 12 status in the nation, for the time being. The Gauchos next opponent will be a week from now in a regular season matchup, which will take place on the road versus UCLA on Wednesday, March 28 at 7 p.m.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following its first successful sweep of the season, the UCSB baseball team heads on the road for a quick match against the University of Pepperdine where it hopes to pick up its first road win of the season. Winners of four of their last five matches, the Gauchos are currently 9-11-1 overall on the season. The match against Pepperdine will be Santa Barbara's final before it begins conference play. The Waves host the ""òChos†boasting just a 10-13 overall record and just recently dropped two of three against conference rival LMU. For what feels like the first time this season, UCSB has some real momentum heading into a road match. Being 0-5 on the road so far this season, a win against Pepperdine would be huge for Santa Barbara before it hosts Big West best Cal State Fullerton this weekend beginning Thursday. Having played ranked teams in SDSU and Mississippi St. as well as teams with excellent win-loss records such as Fresno St. and Texas St., the Gauchos' road so far this year has been among the toughest in the country, with a combined .531 winning percentage that ranks in the top-100 nationally. However, things may lighten up the rest of the way, as the Gauchos' future opponents have just a .461 winning percentage. In their most recent series, the Gauchos managed to rake the ball all over Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Against San Jose State, UCSB scored eight runs per game batting .265. Center fielder Tommy Jew played a huge factor in the Gauchos big weekend. Jew went 5-9 on the weekend with six RBI's. In the month of March, the sophomore has tallied 13 RBI's. After a slow start to the season, UCSB's offense is starting to show signs of life. The Gauchos are slashing .298/.373/.461 as a team in March and are averaging just under six runs per game, compared to a .204/.309/.295 line and under four runs per game in February.†Jason Willow†(.375 batting average),†Tommy Jew†(.353) and†Andrew Martinez†(.324) have been UCSB's hottest hitters this month. As for Pepperdine,†junior†Jordan Qsar†had a day that won't soon be forgotten ""ì and it happened in a four-inning span during the Waves' comeback 11-7 victory over New Mexico on Tuesday, March 13 in Malibu. Trailing 7-0, Qsar blasted a three-run home run to cut the Lobo lead to four. Qsar again stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the eighth with the game tied 7-7 with the bases loaded and blasted the first pitch he saw for a grand slam to give the Waves an 11-7 lead. The El Cajon, Calif., native then pitched a scoreless ninth inning to secure the win ""ì capping an impressive day that saw him set career highs for home runs (two) and RBI (seven). UCSB takes on Pepperdine at 3 p.m. on March 27th at Pepperdine baseball field.

sports,Big West Play Opens With UCSB Hosting Conf. Favorite Cal State Fullerton,29-Mar-18,7:07 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-29/big-west-play-opens-with-ucsb-hosting-conf-favorite-cal-state-fullerton/,"After fielding the ball, Andrew Martinez throws to first base. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus 22 games into the season, but none have mattered as much as these next three will for the UCSB baseball team as it begins conference play against one of the more consistently tough opponents in the Big West, Cal State Fullerton. Santa Barbara comes into the weekend match-up boasting just a 9-11-1 overall record while CSUF comes into town with a little worse 9-13 overall mark. UCSB is the hotter of the two teams having won five of its last eight games while Fullerton has lost three of its last four. Despite having represented the Big West in the College World Series last season, the Titans have struggled in 2018. To begin the year, CSUF was ranked No. 10 in the nation, however, a tough preseason schedule has led to its modest overall mark thus far. In their non-conference schedule, Fullerton has played No. 1 Oregon State, No. 3 Stanford and No. UCLA. All-time, this series has been very one-sided†as the Titans have amassed a 104-39 record against the Gauchos including a 49-19 record at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. 2014 was the last time UCSB defeated Cal State Fullerton in a three-game series. Overall, the key for the Gauchos this weekend will be to continue building off its recent success. Recently, the Santa Barbara starting weekend pitching staff has been solid as in the last five games and 27 innings they have only given up an average of 1.33 runs per game. Sophomore Chris Lincoln has been a huge part of this success. In his first two career Saturday starts, the Rancho Verde alum has only given up 2.53 runs per game in 10.2 inning pitched while also striking out nine batters. Overall, Lincoln has a 1.93 ERA this season. Similarly, senior Stevie Ledesma has also made a strong transition from the bullpen into a weekend starter. The SBCC transfer has posted a 0.81 ERA in his two Sunday starts while striking out five. With success coming in the latter starts, UCSB knows it needs more production from game one starter Jack Dashwood. The freshman has shown flashes of brilliance with his strong arm, but has also shown weaknesses. In six starts, the left-handed pitcher has accumulated a 4.78 ERA with a 1-3 record. However, Dashwood has only given up six runs in his last three starts. This, along with a revived offense is what has helped the Gauchos hit their stride a bit.†The Gauchos are slashing .291/.384/.451 as a team in March and have hit 11 dingers. This compared to a .204/.309/.295 line and one homer in February shows the positive trend for this team. Sophomore center fielder Tommy Jew has been a big factor in this department for the ""òChos. In the month of March, Jew has recorded a hit 11 of UCSB's 13 games including five games with multiple hits. Additionally, Jew has clipped an incredible .395 in the month of March to go along with 13 RBI's and two home runs. The California native's .324 batting average ranks ninth in the Big West while his .457 OBP ranks fifth and his .485 slugging ranks 12th. Defensively, Jew has also been incredible in the outfield. His diving catch a couple days ago against Pepperdine saved the Gauchos in the bottom of the 10th in what would've resulted in a loss had the ball fell. For the Titans, relying on sophomore catcher Daniel Cope will continue to be important. Cope has tallied hits in 13 of his last 15 batting .344 with three home runs, nine RBI's and 12 runs. On March 12th, Cope earned his first career Big West player of the year. Overall, this is a huge opportunity for the Gauchos to catch a struggling Titans team while their down. UCSB has not won a regular-season conference title in the Andrew Checketts' era, and in a season where it has struggled in conference play, it might need to if it wants to make it to the postseason. UCSB begins a three-game series against CSUF at 3 p.m. on Thursday, March 29 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

sports,Colton Eastman's No-Hitter Leads Titans Past Gauchos 3-0 in Big West Opener,29-Mar-18,8:06 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-03-29/colton-eastmans-no-hitter-leads-titans-past-gauchos-3-0-in-big-west-opener/,"Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus It was a tough day at the plate for the UCSB baseball team as CSUF's junior right-handed pitcher Colton Eastman tossed his first career no-hitter helping to lead the Titans past the Gauchos 3-0 in game one of this three-match conference series. In a battle of two nine-win†teams, it is Cal State Fullerton who gets to 10 wins first as it improves to 10-13 on the year, 1-0 Big West while Santa Barbara falls to 9-12-1 overall and 0-1 in conference. Eastman's no-hitter was the fifth in the storied program's entire history and Fullerton's first since 2014. The Fresno, California native had never pitched beyond the seventh inning before today's spectacular finish. From the beginning, Eastman looked dominant as the Gauchos were not even able to get a runner on base until he walked junior designated hitter Clay Fisher in the bottom the fourth with two outs on the board. By then, Cal State Fullerton had already accumulated†a 2-0 lead thanks to a strong second inning. Freshman southpaw Jack Dashwood was on the mound in Thursday's game and put together a solid outing despite a tough start. In the first inning, Dashwood gave up two singles giving CSUF runners on first and second with one out. What could've turned into a rough inning was saved by a brilliant 6-4-3 double play converted by freshman infielder Andrew Martinez. Still playing shortstop due to Fisher's surgery last season, Martinez has quickly become a dominant force on the defensive end. Despite not having the flash Fisher has shown, the California native has been a consistent force at short, something UCSB could not find last season when Fisher was first hurt. Despite that, Dashwood still found himself in trouble again in the second inning after Fullerton's lead-off batter freshman catcher Tyler Lasch reached first on an error by third baseman Jason Willow. After another single and a sac bunt, the Titans had runners on second and third with just one out. Freshman infielder Brett Borgogno then brought in a run with a single up the middle. CSUF would add one more run off a sac bunt to take the 2-0 lead. Despite early troubles, Dashwood settled down striking out the side in both the third and fourth before giving up just two hits in the fifth that were not converted into runs. In the sixth, however, Dashwood gave up one more run off another Borgogno RBI single. Borgogno finished the day 3-4 with two RBI's while Dashwood's day would end after the sixth inning. The freshman finished the day giving up eight hits, three runs, one earned and five K's. After yet another inning of nothing happening for the Gaucho offense in the bottom of the sixth, junior Kevin Chandler was called out of the bullpen in the seventh and played spectacularly. In three innings of relief work, the right-hander allowed just two hits and gave up one walk while striking out two. Chandler is what helped keep the Gauchos in the game long enough to hold out hope. In the bottom of the ninth, UCSB had its best chance to get the best of a tired Eastman. After Martinez struck out, sophomore center fielder Tommy Jew reached first after an error by the second baseman and then reached second base after a defensive indifference. With Jew on second, Fisher was up to the plate and took first after being hit by a pitch. Junior Sam Cohen advanced the runners to second and third after a hard groundout. With two outs, the game came down to freshman infielder Marcus Castanon. Like every batter before him on this day, Castanon was unable to get a hit off of Eastman and the game ended with Fullerton earning the 3-0 victory. Eastman would finish the game with the aforementioned no-hitter striking out seven batters. For UCSB, Thursday's loss is a tough one to swallow. Obviously, credit goes to Eastman for a spectacular performance, but his play highlighted the big problem for Santa Barbara the past two seasons: consistent play at the plate. UCSB will continue its series against CSUF at 3 p.m. on Friday, March 30 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus A big hit by freshman Drew Williams might have just saved the UCSB baseball team's season as his go-ahead RBI single in the bottom of the eighth inning did just enough to push the home team past the visiting Titans 6-5 and even the series up. ""úRegardless of the score, we needed to come back and play good quality baseball today after the series opener, and we did that,""ù said UCSB assistant coach Eddie Cornejo. ""úDrew has had minimal opportunities so far as a freshman, but he's put together good, competitive at-bats and we felt like he had a good chance against Conine there.""ù Santa Barbara is now 10-12-1 on the season and 1-1 in the Big West with a big opportunity to steal the series from CSUF who it has not beaten in a best of three series since 2014. With the loss, the Titans fall to 10-14-1 and also 1-1 in conference play. UCSB held the advantage for most of the afternoon jumping out to a†very early 3-0 lead and even holding suit with a 5-2 but Fullerton just kept whittling†away. The Gauchos put pressure on early, with†Andrew Martinez†leading off the bottom off the first with his team-leading fourth home run of the season and then†Armani Smith shooting a two-run double into right-center to stretch UCSB's lead to 3-0 in the second. CSUF's Ruben Cardenas was plunked by a pitch with one out in the third, then Cope singled to left to give the Titans a scoring threat, with runners at first and second and just one out. Tyler Lasch†then grounded out, but the runners advanced to second and third. Pavletich then came through with his biggest knock of the day, as he placed one perfectly in left center for a two-RBI single to make it just a 3-2 deficit. Junior shortstop Clay Fisher would add to that lead with an RBI triple in the fifth to give themselves a bit of distance with the lead now being 4-2. Sophomore center fielder Tommy Jew would push the lead up an extra run with an RBI single in the top of the seventh. Eventually, the Titans would catch the Gauchos after a two-run eighth inning tied the score up at 5-5. With that, CSUF looked like it had all the momentum going its way. However, Williams came through with the biggest hit of his young career, against one of the top closers in the country no less, to re-establish the lead for UCSB. His seeing-eye base hit back through the middle brought across junior right fielder†Michael McAdoo, who put the Gauchos in business by ripping a one-out double into the left-center field gap. That one run proved to be enough for UCSB sophomore right-hander†Shea Barry, who bounced back from a shaky eighth inning by rolling up three consecutive routine ground balls in the top of the ninth to seal the win. With the win, Santa Barbara now has the chance to go for the series win and pick up a much-needed victory against one of the Big West's most consistent baseball programs. Despite this being a down year for CSUF no one could doubt the importance of this series tomorrow. UCSB concludes its three-game series tomorrow at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

Santa Barbara comes into this game with an 11-3 overall, 0-2 conference record, with a loss in their most recent game against No. 7 UC Irvine by a score of 7-2. Sophomore utility Sarah Snyder led the way with two goals for the ""òChos with one coming off of an assist from freshman attacker Mollie Simmons. Cal State Northridge, currently 15-13 overall, has been on a hot streak as of late, winning four of its past six games by an average margin of nine goals. Two key players for CSUN during this stretch have been seniors Madeleine Sanchez and Niki Van Vugt. Sanchez leads the Matadors offense with 45 goals, which is the second highest tally in the Big West so far. The attacker has done a great job of sharing the ball as well, notching 30 assists, which puts her in the top five in the conference. Van Vugt has been one of the best goalkeepers in the conference so far, actually leading the Big West in saves with 163. The Matadors are fresh off a heartbreaking loss against No. 14 Long Beach State where they lost in overtime by a score of 10-8. Senior attacker Katelyn Fairchild netted a hat trick, giving her 42 goals on the year while Vugt had 14 saves on the day. UCSB will be looking to overcome the offensive struggles they've dealt with over the last two games. They have scored an average of just two goals per contest, far below their season average of nine. In order to regain their momentum, the Gauchos will depend on utility players Kate Pipkin and Snyder to create more opportunities to score, whether it be for their teammates or for themselves. Pipkin in particular has had a knack for setting up her teammates with opportunities to find the back of the net. She currently leads the team with 29 assists and is on pace for the best offensive season of her UCSB career. ""úShe is definitely someone on our team, whether she is scoring or assisting the ball, that has a hand on every play,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay said. Despite UCSB's current losing streak, the ""òChos continue to maintain a positive attitude with just three games remaining before the Big West Tournament. ""úThis is always an exciting time because it is the finale,""ù Kay explained. ""úFor us, we have to just play and realize that this is the end of the process. Now, it's time to play and execute.""ù One bright spot so far for the Gauchos has been the play of freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who have shared time in front of the cage for the past three games. The dynamic duo has averaged 11 saves per game together and will look to continue their success this weekend. ""úThey have both been doing a nice job,""ù Kay stated. ""úKenzi Snyder has started every game for us and sets the tone and Becca Buck, as a freshman, has done a nice job of settling in as well.""ù UCSB will look to take advantage of three straight home games, which they hope will lift their level of play.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following a very unfortunate sweep against Cal State Fullerton last week, the UCSB softball team seeks redemption in its upcoming conference series against UC Davis this Saturday and Sunday. The Gauchos' rocky debut in the Big West conference left them with a 0-3 record in conference play and an overall record of 13-23. They now run a five-game losing streak. The Aggies, on the other hand, competitively counter UCSB's records with two wins and a loss in Big West and a hefty 20-12 overall record. With three out of its five most recent losses being by eight or more runs, UCSB must look to minimize UCD's run count. Davis is coming off of two high-scoring wins against fellow Big West competitor CSUN in which it accumulated a total of 23 hits. Though comparatively Santa Barbara totaled a close 18 hits in its latest series, they simultaneously allowed 28 hits from the opposing team while UC Davis allowed just 13. It is here that the Gauchos will look to their bullpen. So far, the five-person pitching lineup has racked up a 4.74 ERA on the season. Freshman Emily Schuttish unfortunately bears the brunt of the lofty 8.00 ERA the women have accumulated in the Big West Conference, as she has pitched eight innings, the most of all the pitchers, in the past three games. Regardless of which combination of pitchers Coach Galicinao chooses to challenge Davis with, consistency and a strong defensive game both on the mound and in the field are imperative. When it comes to Gaucho hitting, however, the team has proven to be a much stronger force. They currently boast a .273 team batting average and an impressive .390 slugging percentage. Both of these cumulative numbers outweigh UC Davis, whose corresponding stats fall at .264 and .341. Alyssa Diaz, an infielder for Santa Barbara, will hopefully continue to be a pivotal player in the upcoming games. In addition to holding the second-highest batting average on the team so far, the sophomore's stellar performance at the plate in Big West has her at four hits and a consequent .500 batting average in conference games. The Aggies' freshman Alyse Rojas had a similar Big West debut with five hits, one of them being a home run. The utility player sports a .625 in-conference average. Though just a rookie, Rojas has proven to be a dominant offensive leader of the team as she boasts 43 hits and a stunning .410 batting average. Defensively, so far only freshman Brooke Yanez and sophomore Katie Kibby, both of whom have winning records and ERAs under 2.5, have seen the mound in conference play for Davis. Yanez has been a crucial aspect to the defensive stability of her team, congruent to her teammate Rojas's contributions to the Aggies' offensive game. In her 17 appearances, she has totaled a whopping 141 strikeouts, outnumbering all five Gaucho pitchers combined. The Gauchos' offensive downfalls fortunately are not typically tied to excessive strikeouts, but rather to a lack of execution in run-scoring. It is therefore imperative they capitalize on their above-average on-base percentage, which holds strong at .333. Ideally, if all aspects of its game fall into place, this three-game series will boost Santa Barbara's suffering record. At the very least it will act as a much-needed driving force that pushes them toward future success in the Big West conference. UCSB is away once again, playing on UC Davis territory this weekend at La Rue Field. The teams face each other in a double header on Saturday beginning at noon. The battle will conclude on Sunday at noon as well. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 5th, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

Santa Barbara went 1-1 on the weekend and finished the regular season with a 15-12 overall record, 2-3 conference record, as it could not find a rhythm offensively against the Rainbow Wahine but was able to rebound nicely against the Aggies on Senior Day. The Gauchos began the weekend by facing a Hawai'i squad, who are now 20-4 overall, with a 5-0 conference record, that came in riding a two-game winning streak. Freshman attacker Mollie Simmons won the opening sprint to start the game which gave UCSB early momentum. On the ""òChos second possession of the game, sophomore utility Sarah Snyder was able to find the back of the net to give UCSB an early 1-0 lead over the Rainbow Wahine. Less than 30 seconds later, Hawaii would respond with a goal from Junior utility Femke Aan, giving her 34 goals on the year to knot the game up at 1-1. With momentum on their side, the Rainbow Wahine were able to score another goal as freshman utility Carmen Baringo netted her first of two goals on the day to give Hawaii a 2-1 lead going into the second period. Hawaii would dominate the second period as they not only scored three goals but also did not allow UCSB to score a goal in the entire period, which put the halftime score at 5-1 in favor of the Rainbow Wahine. In the third period, Santa Barbara and Hawaii would both score on two straight possessions each to make things interesting after two goals from Simmons and junior utility Sarah Kreiser for the ""òChos and two goals for Hawaii from redshirt senior utility Chloe Barr to put the game at 7-3. Barr would score another goal later in the period, giving her five goals on the match and 42 on the year. With the score at 9-3 in favor of Hawaii to start the fourth period, UCSB would look to find some offensive rhythm to build upon for their match against the Aggies, just a day later. Junior center Emily Martin was able to end the scoring drought for Santa Barbara as she scored with just one minute left in the game. The Rainbow Wahine added two more goals in the period and the game ended with a final score of 11-4. Just 24 hours later, the Gauchos were back in the pool as they faced a red-hot Aggies squad, that is currently 18-9 overall on the year, with a 3-2 conference record. This game was the last regular season home game for Santa Barbara which meant that it was the last time senior defender Annie Mortimer would suit up for UCSB. Mortimer came into the game with five goals and six assists on the year and looked to get a win in her last home game for the ""òChos. In the first period, sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would start off strong for Santa Barbara as she had two early saves. On a power play with 3:54 remaining in the period, Simmons netted her first goal of the day off of a pass from Mortimer giving UCSB an early 1-0 lead. UC Davis did not have any offensive rhythm in the first period and looked to change that as the second period started. Just a minute into the period, sophomore attacker Kathleen Schafle would tie the game up for the Aggies. After a couple of defensive stands from both teams, Kreiser would score for the Gauchos giving them a one-goal advantage. Junior utility Annie Kutt would net her only goal of the game for UC Davis to lock things up at two goals apiece. Goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder would later score with two minutes remaining in the second period as she launched a ball over UC Davis' keeper but once again Schafle would score for the Aggies, putting the score at 3-3 going into halftime. Mortimer would start things off in the second half by scoring her first goal of the game which ignited the crowd at the Newport Beach Native was not only able to put a goal away on her senior day but also give Santa Barbara the lead. After the game was tied at five goals apiece, Simmons and Sophomore Attacker Natalie Selin would each net goals to give UCSB a 7-5 lead heading into the fourth period. Simmons would complete her hat trick in the fourth period off of a great pass from Sarah Snyder on a fast break and after two crucial saves from Kenzi Snyder, Kreiser would put the game away with a goal that put the final score at 9-5. Simmons led the way for the ""òChos as she finished the weekend with four goals, three steals, and one assist. Despite not being the biggest in the pool, Simmons continues to find ways to make a positive impact on her team. ""úPersonally, I am not a big player,""ù Simmons stated. ""úI have to use my mobility and speed to get goals.""ù With this marking Mortimer's last regular season for the ""òChos, she ended up finishing in style with one goal and two assists. ""úThis is definitely bittersweet,""ù Mortimer stated. ""úIt feels really good to go out on a win and I think that was one of our best games of the season. We all played really well together and everyone contributed which made it a great game.""ù UCSB will look to continue their momentum from this weekend as they head into the conference tournament in two weeks. Santa Barbara will head to Irvine on April 27th where their opponent has yet to be determined to compete in the Big West Tournament.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After two straight wins, including a road win over then No. 49 Washington, the UCSB men's tennis team will look to keep its momentum this weekend when it opens conference play by taking on Hawaii and UC Irvine at home. In total, the Gauchos have won four of their last five matches, including their first road win of the season against the Huskies, bringing their overall record to 10-6.Santa Barbara hopes this game represents a turning point in its season after dropping its first five road matches this year. Sophomore Joseph Guillin finally had his 12-match winning streak in singles broken against Washington, although he did so operating out of the number one position for the Gauchos.
In his last match against Denver, after returning to his newfound home at the two slot, Guillin once again picked up a victory, continuing his remarkable season with a 14-2 singles record in his first year as a Gaucho. Additionally, after struggling to pick up the doubles point in the beginning of the season, the 'Chos have won that point in six of their last eight matches ""î a good sign heading into conference play, where UCSB will look to win the Big West conference for the fourth consecutive year. On paper, Santa Barbara will be able to ease into conference play, opening its slate against a Hawaii team that has struggled en route to a 2-11 overall record. The Rainbow Warriors have also accumulated losses against teams that UCSB easily handled, losing convincingly earlier this year to both Pacific and USF. But with sports ""î particularly with conference play ""î comes unpredictability, as Hawaii proved when it notched a conference victory last week against UC Davis to give them a 1-0 conference record. The Rainbow Warriors' only other victory this year came against Sacramento State, which they easily handled with a 6-1 win. Thus far, Hawaii has only played two true road matches and has split both. And Hawaii doesn't lack talent on paper. Senior Felix Albert was All-First Team Big West last season. Despite this, they have struggled to put together complete matches throughout the entire season. After that, UCSB will take on UC Irvine, who looks poised to be a contender for the Big West title. Despite starting the season 1-5, the Anteaters finished their non conference schedule with a 12-8 record before dropping their Big West opener against a red hot Cal Poly team at home. Similarly to UCSB, Irvine tends to struggle on the road where it stands just 1-6 in true road games this season. Coupled with Santa Barbara's unbeaten record at home, UCSB would seem to have the upper hand in the matchup. The Anteaters are led by sophomore Luis Lopez, who has accumulated an 11-4 record operating out of the No. 1 spot. In addition, sophomore Daniel Gealer, a transfer from UCLA, has been on fire as of late, winning seven of their last eight matches. When Gealer and Lopez combine for doubles play, they have an overall 8-6 record on the season and could push the dominant duo of Juniors Anders Holm and Nicholas Moreno De Alboran on court one. Outside of those two, however, Irvine has struggled in doubles play, barely holding a winning record on the season. They may need to win the doubles point on Sunday in order to eliminate the added momentum the Gauchos will have from their home crowd. Thus far, UCSB has had a turbulent season, playing well for the most part but struggling on the road and in close matches. With conference play, they now have a chance to start fresh, to build on their successes and failures from the early parts of the season. Most importantly, they now have a chance to leave a lasting legacy by winning their fourth straight title. The Gauchos will take on Hawaii on Friday at 1:30 p.m. at the Rec Cen courts, and will take those same courts once again for their match against Irvine on Sunday at noon.

sports,UCSB Hopes to Dominate Big West Challenge Cup,5-Apr-18,5:13 AM,['Patrick Hunter'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-05/ucsb-hopes-to-dominate-big-west-challenge-cup/,"Nexus File Photo The UCSB track & field team will turn its attention to one of the most exciting meets of the season as it participates in the Big West Challenge Cup this upcoming Friday. The Gauchos will face off against meet-host UC Irvine as well as Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State, where the women's team will look to repeat as champions, while the men's side will try to improve on their third-place finish from a year ago. Last weekend, the team sent representatives to both the UCLA Legends and Stanford Invitationals. Several Gauchos posted personal records and season bests but perhaps none were more impressive than senior Patrick Bourke's mile run, which etched him in at No. 10 in the all-time UCSB record books. After their strongest showing of the season to date, the Gauchos have the necessary momentum to continue their good stretch and make a splash against some fellow Big West competitors. Despite losing several key contributors from last season's championship effort, the UCSB women's team still has plenty of strong pieces to help them defend their crown. Junior hurdler Hope Bender has emerged as a budding star in both the 100m and 400m hurdles this season, while senior long jumper Kiely Gode will hope to improve on her season best jump of 20' 2 1/2 ""ù, a mark that ranks comfortably within the top-20 in the nation this season. Senior Kayla Thayer will make an impact in the throwing field, as one of her recent discus attempts fell a mere 3/4'' short of reaching the all-time records. However, no athlete will be more important for the Gauchos than standout senior Jenna Hinkle, whose dominant season has seen her go undefeated against conference foes. After taking first place in the 800m race at the same meet last season, she will try and continue her unblemished record against all challengers from three tough Big West opponents. Meanwhile, the men's team will hope to improve on last year's third-place finish. This year's squad is led by several returning upperclassmen who have impressed all season long. Leading the way for the track team is senior sprinter Sike Azu-Irondi, who has set blazing personal bests for himself all season in the 200m and barely missed beating his own school record for the 100m dash, finishing .02 seconds off the time with a 10.57 time. Junior Callan Cochran has also put together a great season, picking up a couple wins and top-10 finishes in the 100m dash himself. Bourke will hope to build off his historic performance and illustrious career in his final season as a Gaucho. The track group is rounded out by several distance runners, including redshirt sophomores Austin Lay and Josh Paradise, who placed first and second respectively in the steeplechase at the same meet last year, and rising sophomore Isaiah Lozano. The group competing on the field will be a key component to the Gauchos' movement up the standings this year. Anchoring the field squad is senior discus hurler Kordell Hampton, who has rolled over the competition all season. His mark of 184' 11""ù at the Aztec Invite two weeks ago topped his own all-time school record, giving him the two top marks in Gaucho history. Joining him will be senior javelin thrower Chris Ross, whose best meet last year was at the Challenge Cup, and freshman Chase Tarr. The two have thrown for personal bests already this season and hope to continue their positive trend and development. Senior decathlete Jeff Lam finished third in last year's long jump and hopes to leave his mark in several events for the upcoming meet. While all of the athletes will hope to make an impact to help bring home first place, look for senior standouts Hinkle, Azu-Irondi and Hampton to leave their marks on the meet and their respective events. The meet will begin at 2 p.m. on Friday, April 6, at Anteater Stadium at UC Irvine. It will be a one-day meet for all teams involved.

sports,UCSB Presented With Promising Opportunities Heading Into Weekend Series,6-Apr-18,2:01 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-06/ucsb-presented-with-promising-opportunities-heading-into-weekend-series/,"Jack Dashwood pitches the ball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Coming in off a loss to USC in its midweek matchup just a few days ago, the UCSB baseball team will look to regroup with its final non-conference three-game weekend series of the 2018 campaign against UTRGV. ""ú[The loss against USC shows] there are some things we still have to work on and focus on in order to get to where we want to be,""ù Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. Santa Barbara hosts the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley with just an 11-13-1 overall mark but a 2-1 conference record. UTRGV comes into this weekend series boasting a strong 16-13 overall record along with a 3-3 conference mark but has lost its last three games all by at least five runs and a combined 25 runs. This weekend will mark the first time these two programs meet in school history, and, as such, it is an important one for UCSB. Having lost to USC 9-3 on Tuesday, the Gauchos failed to capitalize on the chance of getting to .500 for the first time this season and to continue the momentum it had gained from taking two of three against perennial Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton. Despite this being the first time UCSB will take on UTRGV, it is no strangers to opponents from the WAC conference ""î the conference UTRGV belongs to. In the Checketts' era, Santa Barbara has posted a 13-11 mark against Western Athletic Conference opponents with all of those games being against either Sac State, who it dropped two of three to earlier this year, or Cal State Bakersfield who it has yet to play this season. Against Texas schools in general during the Checketts' era, UCSB has gone 8-15. ""úHonestly all the Texas teams we have played so far have been really talented so we are going to treat these guys like any other team and come out ready to play,""ù Lincoln said. ""úWe are definitely confident. We know we have the talent to compete with anybody if we do all the things we know we can do.""ù This series is also important because it marks the end of the six-series, 21 of 22 game homestand the Gauchos were enjoying in the middle to latter part of its season. A series win against a quality opponent would be huge. UCSB has won its last two weekend series and a big part of that has been the pitching as it has only allowed an average of 2.5 runs per game in its last six weekend matches. ""úObviously it starts with pitching and we have had some solid performances on the mound from guys like Ledesma who was great last week,""ù Checketts said. Being the Sunday starter, Stevie Ledesma has been nothing short of spectacular in his first three starts this season. In those games, the senior has tallied a 0.96 ERA and delivered a beauty in his win against CSUF last Sunday going 7.2 innings allowing just four hits, one earned run while striking out five. Right-hander Chris Lincoln has also been nothing short of solid these last few weeks recording a 2.70 ERA as a starter. He currently sports a 2.15 ERA on the year overall and has also recorded a career-high 27 strikeouts. ""úThis is still a learning experience for me and I know I still have a lot to learn but I just want to put my team in the best position to win and I think I have done a decent job so far,""ù Lincoln said. ""úIt's been a lot of mental focusing this year and trying to attack hitters more this season and it's paid off.""ù In his career, the sophomore has made six career starts but has yet to pick up a win. His lone victory of his career came in relief work. In three starts so far this season, Lincoln has earned a no decision in each outing but the ""òChos have won each match. ""úSo far this year all of my starts have been team wins and I am happy with that and I know if I keep working the win will come, but yeah absolutely I'd like to get my first [win],""ù Lincoln said. With former bullpen pitchers now becoming starts, UCSB has needed other guys to fill those roles and sophomore Shea Barry and freshman Chris Troye has done just that. ""úShea Barry has been great out of the pen and Chris Troye looks like he is getting healthier and consistent so that's a boost,""ù Checketts said. This season, Barry has a 2-0 record and one save with a 3.09 ERA and 12 K's while Troye, who struggled earlier this year, has allowed zero runs in his last two outings in relief. One thing the Gauchos do have to worry about is replacing stud freshman Andrew Martinez to an injury. This year he has become a defensive star and had a .319 batting average with four homers. ""úLosing Martinez is tough but [Marcus] Castanon has done a great job filling in at shortstop but now we need to fill our second base spot so really that is key for us going forward,""ù Checketts said. Overall this weekend could be a real turning point for the Gauchos but it needs to take advantage something it hasn't done the past few weeks. ""úWe would like to finally be above .500 by the end of this weekend, it will be tough but it would be nice to have that momentum going forward,""ù Checketts said. UCSB takes on UTRGV for game one at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 6 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Typically, the storylines in men's college basketball are about the next one-and-done superstars that look to be on their way to the next level. Although overlooked, the journey of a four-year starter is still alive. It's usually the case at mid-major Division I schools. It's a reality we oftentimes witness at UCSB on a yearly basis. While it is common at UCSB, the opportunity to watch a player's development over the span of four years is a priceless experience. In the case of guard Gabe Vincent, who is preparing for the next chapter in his playing career, the four-year process was nothing short of fulfilling as his name is forever etched in Gaucho history. SW: Your collegiate career has officially come to an end. Have you had the chance to reflect on your time as a Gaucho?
GV: ""úI did a little bit [of reflecting] after the loss in the Big West Tournament. I took a week off, but that was more so for my body, so it could recuperate and get prepared for my next step. It's been a fun ride. I completed some things I didn't think I would or really had in my sights. Obviously, I had some unfinished business. But all in all, it's been amazing. Everything I could have ever wanted it to be in many ways.""ù SW: Speaking of ""úunfinished business,""ù the main focus was to make the NCAA tournament. It was a feat that didn't happen for you during your career. After going through that, how much of an impact did it have on you? At the same time, how did it influence your mentality to grind for it year in and year out?
GV: ""úIt's a motivation. It's a goal for every collegiate basketball player. At least it should be if it isn't. That's the ultimate goal every season, day in and day out. Falling short of that year after year makes you work harder in the offseason. It's the ultimate motivation; not achieving something you wanted and planned to achieve. That journey was rough. Battling back from injury, looking back, it has all helped mold me into who I am today. Not achieving this goal is still going to motivate me everyday moving forward in my professional career as well.""ù SW: Just a few weeks ago, you, Leland King II and two other seniors of the Big West (CP's Victor Joseph and UCR's Chance Murray) played in college basketball's first ever three-on-three tournament/national championship (Dos Equis 3√ó3). Y'all didn't win the championship, but can you talk about that experience? Was it difficult adjusting to playing with two guys you usually were matched up against? How was it to be able to do something that college athletes aren't allowed to do as far as making some money?
GV: ""úThat experience was very different. Very different. Even though we were representing the Big West and Santa Barbara in a way, it didn't feel like it because we were getting paid. It more so felt like ""òthis is the first step toward a professional career.' It was fun being able to play for money with those other guys that you are used to being enemies with. You study their game and film, and know everything they can do left and right. It was definitely nice to play with them and not against them, and get to know them in a different way. Even the game of three-on-three with the rules they had was something that five-on-five doesn't even expose you to at all. Being able to battle and get to the championship was a great opportunity that went really well for us. Unfortunately, we fell short but we were able to make some money and played well.""ù SW: Although your collegiate playing career has concluded, you are already back training and preparing for the next level. How has that process been? What kind of regimen are you on at the moment? Is there anything new or are you sticking to your usual preparation leading up to that moment?
GV: ""úThe preparation is a little bit different in terms of not having games to prepare for right now. It's more so preparing for workouts and being ready at any time to showcase my talents and to stay in shape. Before, I couldn't work out as much, especially with my knee. I was worried about my knee and overworking it. But now, with it being close to 100 percent, I'm able to do more. Not having to worry about a game and what not, they can push my limits and see how in-shape I can get and try to get better each day, I'm able to work out more. As of right now, I'm lifting really early, like a 6:30 a.m. lift followed by a hoop workout. I get some food, get another workout in during the day, whether it be an hour or two hours later, just trying to work it in around class [too]. I'm just trying to do as much as possible honestly. Anytime I can hoop, I'm definitely taking advantage of it. Anything I can do to get better.""ù SW: Speaking of the next level, is there anything you have lined up in regard to making the transition to the pro ball?
GV: I'm kind of in this limbo of being ready whenever my number may be called and waiting to see what happens in the next few months here. I've hired an agent. I'm in the finalizing stages of that. Getting that moving forward and having someone to speak on my behalf soon will be great. I'm just trying to get ready for hopefully any league workouts I can get, and just to be prepared for what comes next in the summer. Right now, I'm just preparing for that next step and trying to set things up. It's really interesting for me, as someone who is not anticipating to be drafted. Everything is kind of slow for a while, then things start happening really quickly and you get those answers you're searching for.""ù SW: It's a known fact that UCSB isn't a sports powerhouse. Given that fact, your journey to playing professionally may possibly be more challenging than expected. Is that potential challenge something you anticipate and will embrace? Does it kind of put a chip on your shoulder?
GV: ""úA little bit. Coming to this school, I knew that would be something I would have to deal with down the road. I didn't exactly have the career in many ways that I wanted to. I think coming back this year with my injury kind of held me back numbers wise from the numbers kind of year that I could've had. That definitely hurts me moving forward to this spring and summer. But with that being said, at the end of the day, it's all about who can play and who can perform. I knew that coming into Santa Barbara, and it's part of the reason I came here because I wanted to go somewhere where I could get better. I think I've done that. I'm just trying to get better, and continue to work on my craft and perfect it.""ù SW: Have you reached out to any past Gauchos that are currently playing professional ball? Have you sought any type of advice?
GV: ""úAbsolutely. I've been close to some guys since I committed to UCSB. I've been close with Michael Bryson, who is in the NBA G League right now, James Nunnally, he's overseas now, Orlando Johnson as well. Those are the three people I've been in contact with, and they've always been good during my whole four years here. They've reached out and checked in on me, and have given advice here and there. They've been good resources for me, and a good a part of this Gaucho family.""ù SW: If you could talk to the younger Gabe, is there one particular thing you'd like to mention? Any advice or lesson learned that you have now that would be significant enough?
GV: ""úThat's a tough question for me. I've always been a little more mature than my peers around me and a little more professional with how I carry myself. I think I would give advice to trust the process. That everything you do affects the way things are going to be. Everything I do now, every decision I make now, in my mind, I'm making as a pro. If it's not going to make me better as a pro, then it's like, ""òwhy would I go do that?' Whether it helps my mentality, my body [is important]. I would try to push that mindset on myself at a younger age, which I think I had a little bit of, but obviously as you get older it becomes more serious and you're closer to being at that level. These are all of the sorts of things I would tell myself in hopes that I would listen as a young kid and take that advice.""ù SW: In one word, who is Gabe Vincent?
GV: ""úWow. That's a tough question. I'm going to need a second here.""ù
""úI would say leader.""ù A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 12th, 2018, edition of the¬†Daily Nexus.

sports,No. 11 Gauchos Look To Gain Momentum as Season Ends,12-Apr-18,5:08 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/no-11-gauchos-look-to-gain-momentum-as-season-ends/,"Gauchos huddle up for group huddle before match point. Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The regular season campaign for men's volleyball is now nearing an end. However, the postseason is just on the horizon as the Gauchos will look to finish off their conference calendar with a bang. Santa Barbara currently remains tied for fourth in the Big West league standings alongside CSUN. No. 1 Long Beach State clinched regular season champion honors just last week with a win against UC San Diego, 3-0. A pair of back-to-back wins this week might also be just enough for UCSB to find themselves in either a two-team tie for third or three-team tie for second place in the conference, all depending on how the University of Hawai'i vs. Long Beach State games go. As far as national rankings go, UCSB dropped only one spot, formerly No. 11, following their back-to-back pair of defeats against No. 1 Long Beach State. UC Irvine still remains in third place since the last few poll updates as they continue to chase UCLA in ranking points with hopes that they will soon surpass them. An above .500 winning percentage record will be on the line for the Gauchos as they currently find themselves at 10-11 on the season and 3-5 in terms of conference play. A bit of a drought has been observed as a stellar start to the year has been halted by a streak of losses; the team fell twice in last week's encounter with Hawai'i and have only earned one total victory in their last seven games. UCSB also holds a fairly even overall when at home (6-5) or on the road (4-6). As for the visitors, UC Irvine has shown their elite status as a top three in the nation program, both on the court and on paper. The Anteaters boast a 19-7 overall on the season; that's a .731 winning percentage. In conference UCI currently stands in third place. The team, however, has broken at .500 in their last two regular season/conference opponents of LBSU and CSUN; on the road they are 8-3 and are 8-4 whilst at home. Historically speaking, the Gauchos have a slight advantage over the Anteaters as their all-time series records places them at 46-30. This is the first time this year these two teams have encountered each other. Last time out, during the previous season, UC Irvine bested UC Santa Barbara in back to back games, both by a 3-2 margin. The Gauchos will have a lot riding on the line in this week's matchups as they'll look to close out the regular season on a high note and prove to the Anteaters who is still in charge.
Both sides will showcase players who are amongst the best in their conference. Some individual leaders include UCSB's sophomore opposite Keenan Sanders who is fifth in kills per set at 3.69, and UCI's junior opposite Karl Apfelbach who places fourth overall at 3.79. Apfelbach is also first in total number of kills in the Big West with a whopping 375 total amount on the year. On the defensive end, UCI's seven-foot-tall sophomore middle Scott Stadick leads the league in blocks per set at 1.31. Meanwhile, UCSB's junior middle Connor Drake is fifth in the same category with a near 1.03 count of his own. This week's play will begin with UCSB hosting UCI at home on Thursday, April 12. They'll then head southbound to visit Irvine on Saturday, April 14. Both games are slated to commence at 7 p.m. sharp. The first inaugural Big West Tournament is also set to occur the following week once seeding and scheduling is completed after this last week of conference play.

Santa Barbara will look to pull off the upset at home against both an 18-4, 3-0 conference record Rainbow Wahine team and the Aggies squad, who is 17-8 overall, 2-1 in Big West play, as UCSB comes into this game riding off the high of a 9-5 win over CSUN. UCSB defeated No. 20 CSUN this past Saturday to also earn its first Big West victory of the season. Sophomore utility Sarah Snyder led the way with four goals while freshman goalkeeper Becca Buck had six saves in front of the cage. In their previous matchup, which dates back to last season, Hawaii won 8-3 behind a high-powered offense that averaged 10 goals per game. Hawaii has won six of their last seven games by an average margin of seven goals. They last played against No. 14 Long Beach State in their last home game of the season and won by a score of 12-6. Sophomore utility Maartje Keuning led the way as she netted four goals, giving her 36 on the year. Junior Irene Gonzales netted a hat trick on the game as well, adding to her team-leading record of 49 goals, which also leads the Big West. It will be crucial for the ""òChos to limit the amount of chances Hawaii has on goal by continuing to stay consistent with their defensive energy throughout the entire game. ""úHawaii has very good shooters,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay said. ""úI think they have a lot of fire power so we are going to need to be able to really lock down on defense and get some good shot blocks.""ù As winners of seven of their last 10 games, UC Davis will look to continue their hot streak by relying primarily on their potent offense as they average 11 goals per game on the year. The Aggies were last in action this past weekend when they won a thriller against No. 9 UC Irvine. Senior center Greta Kohlmoos had a hat trick on the day while sophomore goalkeeper Caitlin Golding had seven saves. In order for UCSB to have success against UC Davis, it will be crucial for the ""òChos to slow down junior utility Annie Kutt, who leads the team with 73 points on the year, consisting of 32 goals and 41 assists. Despite struggling on offense in the prior two games before CSUN, Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm offensively, primarily due to the play of Snyder. Snyder comes into this game as the third-leading goal scorer in the conference. With 45 goals on the year, she has already passed last year's personal scoring record by 10 goals and still has two regular season games as well as the Big West Tournament to add to it. ""úShe has been inspiring,""ù Kay stated. ""úI think it is important for her to realize that she does lead our team and there is a target on her back, which makes it a little more challenging for herself but that will lead to other people being open.""ù Moreover, freshman attacker Mollie Simmons continues her diverse level of play in terms of goals, sprints and steals. The San Jose native currently has 17 goals and 33 steals on the year and has consistently won sprints to start off the period and give the Gauchos early momentum. ""úShe is only a freshman and I think there is such room for growth from her,""ù Kay said. ""úI am excited for what is going to come in the future.""ù Both Buck and sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder continue to split time in front of the cage and will look to continue their dominance as of late. With 10 saves and two steals combined in their last game, they have made it extremely difficult for opponents to find the back of the net. ""úI think their presence was good,""ù Kay said. ""úThey have been communicating very well and that is something we have been focusing on.""ù With just two games remaining before the Big West Tournament, UCSB will look to increase their seed in the Big West Standings as they are currently in fifth place. If they win both games, they will put themselves in a great position to secure at least a top-three seed in the tournament. Santa Barbara will look to add on to their one-game win streak as they host both Hawaii and Davis this weekend in Santa Barbara at 12 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, at Campus Pool.

sports,UCSB Hopes to Keep Stride Hosting Big West Foe Hawai'i,12-Apr-18,5:05 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-12/ucsb-hopes-to-keep-stride-hosting-big-west-foe-hawaii/,"Samantha Lujan swings at a perfect pitch. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus With both teams on the front end of a winning streak, the UCSB softball team welcomes Hawaii to Santa Barbara as it kicks off a six-game home stand. The Gauchos stand at 15-24 on the season, 2-4 in conference play as they head into their longest home stretch of the season. Hawaii, 19-16 overall, 3-3 in Big West play, prepares for the heart of its conference schedule after sweeping the Cal Poly Mustangs at home last weekend. The Rainbow Warriors look to maintain momentum through their travels to sunny Santa Barbara as the power hitters out of Hawaii have some confidence brewing from a three-game win streak kept alive by a three-run walk-off homer by senior first baseman Rachel Turner in the bottom of the seventh. The up-and-down season for Hawaii has consisted of major power from the team's batting leaders. Sophomore shortstop Callee Heen is on a tear as her second-year campaign has been crucial in keeping the Warriors above .500 on the year. Heen is slapping a commanding .384 batting average along with an .808 slugging percentage, good for the second best in the conference. Power hitting is where Heen strives as she sits tied atop the conference in home runs with 12 long balls on the year and fifth in RBIs with 29. Accompanied by junior third baseman Nicole Lopez who has solidified her three-hole spot in the order, the one-two power hitting tandem has been a puzzle for pitchers the entire year.
Lopez has been a consistent threat, logging the most at bats on the team while hitting .313 in the process. She sits in fifth place in home runs from Big West Conference players with 7 bombs on the year, managing to add 20 RBIs as well. Behind Hawaii's power hitting front end of the lineup is an ace duo of pitching aces commanded by senior pitcher Dana Thompson. Thompson has started all but thirteen of the Rainbow Wahine games this season sporting a 2.95 ERA and adding four complete game shutouts in doing so. Thompson has the second most innings pitched in the conference with 133.0 while sitting in the fifth spot in terms of strikeouts at 107. On the other side, the Gauchos look to continue to keep the bats rolling after their doubleheader sweep over UC Davis last weekend as Hawaii comes into town. Sophomore second base standout Alyssa Diaz remains a competitor throughout as she carries this Gaucho team with a .349 average, 5 home runs and 19 RBIs. While there haven't been many positive takeaways from this season of UCSB softball, production from freshman outfielder Sammy Fabian remains consistent and promising as the first year is putting up premier numbers with a .343 batting average and 9 stolen bases on the year, good for fifth in the conference. Similarly, UCSB does a terrific job making contact with the ball as it leads the conference in the least number of strikeouts on the season, but the team often struggles to score runs when they get runners on. The ""òChos have hit into the most double plays in the conference this season and struggle to get the ball in the air as they also hold the most ground outs. Similarly, they have the second most fly outs in the conference, so while their contact is prime, the placement of the ball when it jumps off the bat is typically to an unideal area of the field. UCSB has difficulty scoring runs and it could be in part by the lack of walks hitters get. The ambitious and active Gaucho bats remain aggressive at the plate, but UCSB only has 84 walks on the season as opposed to some top teams with over 110. On the other hand, Santa Barbara's pitching has been atrocious. The ""òChos sport the highest ERA in the conference with a 4.46 earned run average and lack the ability to close out games down the stretch. The two aces heading into the season, junior Veronika Gulvin and senior Lena Mayer, combine for a 4.99 ERA with eight losses a piece. This weekend marks a big chance for the Gauchos to climb the conference standings before its too late. The series opener between UCSB and Hawai'i takes place at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 13 at Campus Diamond. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 12th, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Looking To Hit Their Stride As Conference Season Comes To An End,13-Apr-18,5:05 AM,['Andrew Bishop'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-13/gauchos-looking-to-hit-their-stride-as-conference-season-comes-to-an-end/,"Palina Dubavets returns a serve. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus With tournament play rapidly approaching, the UCSB women's tennis team is hoping to dominate throughout the remainder of the conference season, which will begin with two road matches against UC Irvine on Saturday and Cal State Fullerton on Sunday. The 7-12 Gauchos had a much needed weekend of rest after escaping the worst slump of their season with a 4-1 victory against Big West rival, Long Beach State, on Mar. 31. Prior to its win against the Beach, UCSB had experienced a turbulent month of March, which consisted of five consecutive losses and two other matches that were cancelled due to poor weather in Santa Barbara. After dropping a match to Big West opponent, Hawaii, on Mar. 30, the Gauchos bounced back the day after to rout Long Beach State. Despite having lacked consistency in doubles play throughout March, the Gauchos had no trouble securing an early lead against the Beach. UCSB's duo of junior Stephanie Yamada and freshman Lise Sentenac, and its No. 40 pairing of seniors Natalie Da Silveira and Palina Duvabets both toppled their Long Beach opponents for the doubles point. The Gauchos' duo of senior Amanda Atanasson and sophomore Amit Lev Ari were also ahead of their opponents when the doubles point was decided. After gathering some early momentum, UCSB continued to excel in singles play, with victories from Duvabets, Atanasson, and Sentenac, which brought the match to a close. With their slump behind them, the Gauchos will look to tackle their upcoming conference opponents, in UC Irvine and CSUF. The Gauchos' weekend will begin with a match on Saturday against the Anteaters, who currently sit at second to last in the Big West with an overall season record of 8-13. Irvine has had extensive struggles against conference opponents this season, which is evident in its 0-5 record in Big West games. The Anteaters are coming off of a recent 5-2 loss to CSU Northridge, which was the only Big West opponent to relinquish points to Irvine this season. Their loss to Northridge marked their sixth consecutive loss, which certainly bodes well for the Gauchos. The next day, UCSB will square off against Cal State Fullerton, which has experienced a dominant 16-4 season, with a 4-1 Big West Record. The Titans currently sit right above the Gauchos at second in the Big West, and Sunday's match will certainly be indicative of the talent levels of both teams. Fullerton has experienced an elevated level of play this season, due in part to exemplary play from No. 114 ranked freshman, Genevieve Zeidan. Zeidan has been dominant in singles play this season, notching a singles victory in each of her team's five Big West matchups this season. The Gauchos have struggled this season against highly touted ranked players like Zeidan, and it is likely that she will give them a run for their money on Saturday. Beyond the No. 1 spot, UCSB's match with Fullerton appears to be significantly less lopsided. The Titans have experienced just one Big West loss this season to UC Davis on Mar. 28, who the Gauchos routed 4-0 at home on Feb. 24. A victory on Sunday could help UCSB move closer to the top of the Big West standings, and it is likely that its match against the Titans will be a pivotal moment in its season. With the No. 2 spot in the Big West in their sights, the Gauchos will hope to leave their previous slump further behind, and hopefully secure two more wins against conference rivals. The Gauchos will face UC Irvine on Saturday, Apr. 14, at 11 a.m. in Irvine, CA. Their match against CSUF is scheduled to take place the day after, on Sunday, Apr. 15, at 11 a.m. in Fullerton, CA. † Comments are closed.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's volleyball team can now take a sigh of relief as its losing streak is broken after managing to pull off an exciting comeback win as it defeated UC Irvine for the upset in the last home game of the regular season. UCSB now stands at a .500 win percentage with their 11-11 split record, and more important is 4-5 in conference play. The Gauchos also now find themselves in fourth place in the Big West Conference standings, with just one game, left away in Irvine, before the postseason tournament seeding begins. This match was potentially the closest one of the entire year, as the first four sets of the night all resulted in scores of 25-23. The first set went to the visitors as the Gauchos gave up an early lead. Following an Anteater service error, the Gauchos put up three back to back kills and managed to bring it within two before falling just short. The following set then featured a victorious performance by Santa Barbara as the tables had turned and Irvine was in catch up mode for most of it. Ultimately, another closely battled set resulted in the 1-1 tie on the night. Concerning the first half of play, head coach Rick McLaughlin was very happy with the teams' effort. ""úIt was a battle; the first four games were all 23-25,""ù McLaughlin said. ""úEither way, when we were down, our guys just played hard in the end and just did a good job.""ù The third set of the night was perhaps the closest of the entire match as either side's advantage was never greater than 3 throughout it all. Regardless, UCSB fell late once more and the visitors were up again. At this point, things were looking bleak for the good guys. However, the service errors and defensive mistakes started to accumulate for the visitors. Naturally, the Gauchos took advantage of this and another 25-23 performance win was just enough to complete the comeback and earn a fifth set. The fifth set truly was a nail bitter as plenty was on the line for the hosts. The fans were chanting, momentum seemed to boom from the Gauchos, and it seemed almost like the perfect way to end the home closer: on a high note. The beginning of the final set had the Gauchos leading, but always by only a couple scores. The score was soon 10-9, advantage UCI, and no one was certain exactly what way it would go. Then came another three back to back scores for the home side and UCSB now looked fully in control. A pair of timeouts and two visiting service errors later, and the Gauchos had done it: an impressive finish against all odds. ""ú[Assistant Coach] Cullen Irons had a pretty good read on what he thought they were going to set, and he was on the mark every time,""ù McLaughlin said. ""úSo we were able to make a plan for blocking, and our servers put great pressure on them. We'll see what we can improve for the next game""¶and it's sure to be another battle.""ù After such an intense match, not only is the coach on edge but also the players. ""úWe have a team where pretty much any guy can come in and put up points""¶There was a lot of momentum, especially in those last three sets,""ù sophomore middle blocker Brandon Hopper said. ""úIt was really nice to have the crowd, always great to have that""¶it gets everybody fired up, and we're starting to get an energy going for ourselves.""ù UCSB will now head down south the UCI for their final matchup of the regular season. It all starts this Saturday, April 14th, on the road at 7 PM.

sports,Gauchos Roughed Up in 10-2 Loss at UC Irvine,14-Apr-18,10:50 AM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/gauchos-roughed-up-in-10-2-loss-at-uc-irvine/,"The UCSB baseball teams' Jack Dashwood was blasted in his outing in the first game of the series by a strong UC Irvine team. With little offensive support to match the deficit, the Gauchos would lose the match, 10-2. With the loss, Santa Barbara falls to 15-14-1 on the season and 2-2 in Big West play. It also remains winless on the road at 0-6. UCI improved to 19-14 on the year and 4-3 in conference play. Dashwood headed into the bottom of the third inning up 1-0 thanks to a Marcos Castanon triple which scored Sam Cohen. The southpaw had only given up one hit until his third trip out to the mound where the lefty allowed two hits to the first two batters he faced and quickly ran into some trouble. With men on first and third, sophomore Christian Koss singled to give the Anteaters their first run of the game. After getting an out in the inning, Dashwood gave up a single to freshman Brendan Brooks bringing another run to the plate and earning UCI the 2-1 lead. RBI and home-run leading senior Ryan Fitzpatrick stepped up to the plate and cleared the bases with a†left-center shot that put the Eaters up 5-1 at the end of three innings. The Gauchos' starter could not stop the bleeding and the UCI batters would pile on to their lead in the subsequent inning. The pair of Christian Koss and Matt Reitano would strike again in the bottom of the fourth inning when the pair earned their second RBI and run of the game respectively. Sophomore Konnor Zickefoose would also make his second trip around the bags and at the end of four, the Anteaters were ahead 7-1. The Zickefoose run would end Dashwood's night at 3.1 innings pitched with seven earned runs. Clay Fisher would score the Gauchos' final run of the game in the top of the eighth, but UCI simply added onto their lead even more in the bottom of the same inning. Senior Cole Kreuter hit a home run to start off the inning while sophomore Ryan Johnston and Ryan Fitzpatrick would each hit singles to bring home runners of their own. UC Irvine would end the first game of the series, victorious by eight at 10-2. It was a tale of two different pitchers as UCI's starter Andre Pallante went the distance, giving up the lone earned run in the third over seven innings pitched. Pallante was able to keep the Gaucho bats silent before forcing his team to go to the bullpen to pull him. The sophomore has had a great month of April so far with 15 innings pitched, one earned run, and two wins over his two appearances. Much like the Dirtbags on his April 6 start, the Gauchos were similarly stifled and failed to get any significant offensive rhythm. Dashwood had an unexpectedly mediocre outing and is now the possessor of a less than exciting 2-5 record. The freshman had been on a recent wave of success before his start against UCI, going at least five innings pitched with one earned run or less in each of his past three starts. However, the 18.90 ERA posted for today's game is Dashwood's worst start of the season. No matter the lefty can certainly move along in the season with the assurance of seemingly nowhere to go but up. The Gauchos will continue the series against the Anteaters on Saturday, April 14 at 2 p.m.

The team had accomplished that exact feat two seasons prior, and Davis thought accomplishing this would help his other main goal""ì finishing the season in the top 50. On Friday, UCSB will have the chance to secure that unbeaten record at home when they take on a struggling UC Davis squad that has dropped three straight matches, including a conference loss to a depleted Hawaii squad. The match will also serve as senior day for the Gauchos""ì and in particular, Senior captain Simon Freund, who is the only senior in the starting lineup at the moment. For the captain, the match will have an added importance, signifying his last match in front of his family and friends in his career. ""úIt's starting to kick in more and more that I'm almost done""ì it's really bittersweet,""ù Freund said. ""úI've had a great time, but I'm also kind of ready for the next part of my life.""ù On paper, UC Davis looks like the clear underdog to the Gauchos. The Aggies are currently 0-8 on the road and have a combined 13-22 record on courts one and two in singles play.  With Junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Sophomore Joseph Guillin currently dominating those positions, UC Davis will likely have to win on the lower courts in order to compete with a suddenly red-hot Gauchos squad that has won five straight matches. If Davis is to have a chance, they will have to quell the home crowd by securing the doubles point. On the season. The Aggies' doubles pairs have an overall record of 26-22, proving that they have the doubles talent to potentially keep up with Santa Barbara. In addition, UC Davis will likely be motivated, knowing they need a victory against pre-season conference favorites UCSB in order to keep their title hopes alive. Following that match, the Gauchos will drive down to Riverside to take on a Highlanders team on Sunday that has played much better tennis of late.  After starting the season 4-10, UC Riverside has won 11 of their last 15 matches, putting them above .500 on the season with a 15-14 record. ""úEven though Riverside typically finishes towards the bottom of the Big West standings, we know we can't take the match for granted,""ù Senior Chase Masciorini said. ""úSince we're outside of the top 50 right now, we known we likely need to win the conference in order to go to the NCAA tournament.""ù The match will also take on added importance for Masciorini""ì he is likely to start the six spot for the first time since getting injured at the end of last season.  If Masciorini can perform at the same level he did last season, the Gauchos will benefit from having a consistent veteran performer at the six spot, where they have struggled all season. Similarly to the Aggies, the Highlanders also tend to play much stronger at the lower positions, which will prove to be a test of UCSB's depth. UC Riverside is 16-10 at the five position and 20-6 at the six position, while they have a below .500 record at the top two positions.  In addition, despite their recent victory at No.50 LMU, UCSB has struggled on the road this season, coming into the match with a 3-6 record away from home. If the Gauchos hope to keep pace with currently unbeaten Cal Poly, they will need to pick up both victories over the weekend and move to 4-0 in the conference.  UCSB will take on UC Davis on Friday at 1:30 p.m. at the rec cen courts, and will take on UC Riverside on Sunday at noon at Riverside. Comments are closed.

sports,Upset Alert? Breaking Down Possible Upsets in 2018 NBA Playoffs,14-Apr-18,1:30 AM,['Ryan Hykes'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-14/upset-alert-breaking-down-possible-upsets-in-2018-nba-playoffs/,"Courtesy of NBA.com Every sports fan will tell you that the basketball Cinderella is a college phenomenon. The NBA's grueling seven-game series almost always favor the higher seed who also have the benefit of home-court advantage. In fact, the last time a team seeded 6th or lower won a playoff series was four seasons ago as the sixth-seeded 2014 Brooklyn Nets. Last season's playoffs were characterized by utter domination by the Cavs and Warriors in their respective conferences, but that might not be the case this year. The Warriors could not even reach 60 wins with their loaded roster and the fourth-seeded Cavs have the lowest seed of a Lebron-led team in 10 years. Don't be surprised if there are no sweeps in the first round as even the 8th seeds in both conferences have stars like John Wall, Bradley Beal, Jimmy Butler, and Karl Anthony-Towns. We are a bit overdue for a big playoff upset and the drama of this season could very well translate into many hard-fought series oozing with upset potential. Here are each conference's best chances for a win by a 6th or lower seed in the first round. #2 Boston Celtics Vs. #7 Milwaukee Bucks The Celtics are an obvious candidate for upsets, due to injuries to stars Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Still, Terry Rozier has stepped up in the lead guard role. Boston's young wings Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum have been playing great this entire season and Al Horford is the epitome of a veteran glue guy. Even if they do get upset, their regular season success has to bode well for their future, when they will hopefully get more than 60 combined games for their two stars. The seed lucky enough to draw the injury-ravaged Celtics is Milwaukee. I think this actually bodes well for Boston considering what the matchup could've been. Milwaukee is the worst coached team in the entire playoffs even after firing Jason Kidd. Interim coach Joe Prunty would have to lead his team to at least the Conference Finals is he wants to be installed as a permanent head coach. While Giannis Antetokounmpo will present a mismatch for the Celtics as the best player on the floor, Brad Stevens could present an equal mismatch in game planning and preparation against Joe Prunty. There are two ways Milwaukee can win this series, Giannis goes to another level and put up playoff Lebron like numbers, overcoming Brad Stevens preparations to limit him. Or the Greek Freak's supporting cast, arguably better than last year's Bucks that put a scare into Toronto, steps their game up and gives the man some help. The first scenario seems more likely, but they might need to rely on their supporting cast if Brad Stevens' gameplan works. This will be a hard fought series and the Celtics are rightfully favored due to homecourt and having the best young coach in the NBA. But, I'll take the Bucks in six. Al Horford, as great as he is, will not be able to guard Giannis by himself, forcing young guns Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum to step in. It works in Game 1, but Giannis finds a way to assert himself and wins the series before it gets back to Boston for Game 7. #3 Portland Trail Blazers Vs. #6 New Orleans Pelicans Portland led by All-Star Point Guard Damian Lillard won 49 games this year to earn the 3 seed. New Orleans with their star Anthony Davis won 48. These teams aren't so far off from each other. Portland's legendary home court advantage should make sure the Moda Center is loud, but New Orleans has a fighting chance. As good as Portland's backcourt duo of Lillard and C.J. McCollum has been this year, Anthony Davis will be the best player on the court. He's averaged 29.8 Points Per Game since the All-Star Break when he's had to carry a heavier load following Demarcus Cousins' Achilles injury. Portland is strongly favored and they beat New Orleans when they didn't have Cousins. But that was only one game. Not only has Davis stepped up since Cousins went down, but Jrue Holiday and the rest of the Pels have started to gel as the season came to a close. Holiday has been especially good. He's averaging 19 PPG, even more than his 2013 All-Star season as a Philadelphia 76er. He's a solid defender and is shooting his best Field Goal percentage of his career at 49%. He will be the key to the series because if he can hold his own against McCollum then Davis has a chance to outduel Lillard. This will be a high scoring series as New Orleans has a particularly porous defense despite Davis' presence in the paint. Lillard will win a game by himself, but Davis could very well win 2 or 3 if he came put up some of the stellar performances he has down the stretch. We all want to see Davis is a meaningful pressure game. I think he delivers in the biggest way. Pelicans win this one in 7 as Davis wins an all-time duel against Lillard to overcome Portland's home crowd.

sports,Gauchos Set Up Rubber Match Following 9-4 Victory,15-Apr-18,2:04 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-15/gauchos-set-up-rubber-match-follwing-9-4-victory/,"Jason Willow swings at a high fastball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus One day after struggling to get any hits against UC Irvine's Andre Pallante, the UCSB baseball team had one hell of a day at the plate flipping the script on the Anteaters to even the series up heading into tomorrow. With the win, Santa Barbara improves to 16-14-1 on the year overall and, more importantly, 3-2 in Big West play. The loss drops UCI to 19-14 on the year and 4-4 in conference play. In total, UCSB tallied 16 hits throughout the course of the game bringing in nine runs in order to set up the rubber match for tomorrow. Freshman Drew Williams was the big hero on the day for the ""òChos†going 4-5 on the day driving home two runs and scoring two also. Early on, Santa Barbara looked as though it would be struggling with the clutch at-bats†as it left the bases loaded in the first. In the second, however, things got going early as Williams with a single and then got to second on a bunt. Redshirt junior Clay Fisher brought him in later with a sac fly. Today was also a special day for Fisher as he started at second base, the first time he has seen field action all season since recovering from surgery on his right, throwing should last year. Junior Sam Cohen then lined a two-run single in the top of the fourth to extend the Gauchos lead to 3-0. In the bottom of the fourth, UC Irvine retaliated with one run to cut the lead down to two. Sophomore right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln was also very solid from the mound all the way through. On the day, Lincoln had another great start allowing just four hits and one earned run in 5.2 innings with three strikeouts. Lincoln was relieved of duty after allowing two singles in the bottom of the sixth. Junior Kevin Chandler came in out of the bullpen and saved the inning striking out the very next batter to keep the Gauchos lead at 3-1. During its half of the seventh inning, UCSB sent 12 batters to the plate scoring six runs against three Irvine pitchers to really take control of the match at 9-1. The rally included a leadoff double by sophomore center fielder Tommy Jew, a run-scoring double by freshman infielder Marcos Castanon, a two-run double by Williams and a pair of bases-loaded walks by UC Irvine's Alonzo Garcia, the third pitcher of the inning. Irvine would go on to score one run in the seventh, eighth and ninth, but at the end of the day that would not be enough as UCSB escaped†with the 9-4 victory. Over the final 3.1 innings, Chandler, freshman†Chris Troye†and junior transfer Alex Patterson allowed one run each, a pretty good outing from the pen following a solid start from Lincoln who picked up his second straight win to improve to 2-1 on the season. At the plate, Williams had his best day as a Gaucho but guys like freshman third baseman McClain O'Conner and Cohen also had solid days tallying multiple-hits. Another important key thing to note is that Saturday's win is the Gauchos first road win of the season, a sign that maybe this team is starting to really turn the corner. Of course, that can't be known until it possibly earns its fourth straight weekend series victory. The UCSB/UCI series will conclude with the rubber match beginning at 1 p.m. on Sunday, April 15 at Cicerone Field. The game will also be live streamed on ESPN3.

sports,Gauchos Beat Down 11-1 in Rubber Match Showdown,16-Apr-18,5:15 AM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-beat-down-11-1-in-rubber-match-showdown/,"Steven Ledesma pitches. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus The UC Irvine Anteaters ran away with the final game of the weekend series on their own turf against the UCSB baseball team, teeing off for six runs in the bottom of the fifth inning and taking advantage of excellent starting pitching on their way to a series-clinching 11-1 victory. With the loss, Santa Barbara drops to 3-3 in Big West play and remains only one game above .500 overall at 16-15-1. UC Irvine improves to 20-14 on the year and 5-4 in conference play. UCSB starter Stevie Ledesma was 3-1 headed into the series finale and was able to stay ahead of the Anteaters early on in the match despite giving up a single run in the third inning. UCI junior Matt Reitano came around for the first run of the game after making his way around the bases on a left side single by freshman Brendan Brooks. Ledesma had more or less recovered an inning after falling behind to UCI, but Reitano would come around the bases early on in the fifth when the catcher hit a long fly ball over the left field fence good for two RBIs. Two more men would reach base and Brendan Brooks would strike again, hitting his second single of the game scoring one from second base. Senior Ryan Fitzpatrick would come to the plate and add two more RBIs to his already team-leading total on the season with his own bases-clearing triple. Nick Anderson would hit a sacrifice fly that would bring Fitzpatrick home and Ledesma would be pulled from the game a batter later. Ledesma's outing on the mound was done over 4.2 innings pitched, seven hits, four earned runs and five strikeouts. By the end of the fifth, the Anteaters were comfortably ahead thanks to their six run explosion midway through the game increasing their lead to 7-0. The Eaters' starter for the game was freshman Trenton Denholm who was cruising throughout the entire game, keeping the Gauchos hitless and scoreless after six innings of work. Denholm was able to comfortably work his way through the lineup solidly in control, striking out batters when he wasn't getting the Gauchos to hit into his waiting defense. UCSB junior Sam Cohen would break Denholm's hitless streak with a single to right field, putting men on first and second after sophomore Eric Yang reached first getting hit by a pitch. ""ò The sophomore would cross the plate on a Denholm wild pitch which would be the only run the Gauchos could muster in the match, unable to match the nine-run effort given a game previously. The Anteaters would win the game 11-1, after tacking on two more runs in the sixth and eighth innings. Brendan Brooks finished the game leading everyone in RBIs with four and tying with senior Parker Coss in Anteaters hits with three. The entire home team showed up at the plate and UCI was able to enjoy their second victory scoring ten runs or more in the series. The stellar pitching from Denholm only made the win that much more sweeter for Head Coach Mike Gillespie who couldn't have asked for a better Sunday game of baseball from his team. The Gauchos will look to regroup in Los Angeles as they continue on with their seven game road trip and hope to escape with a positive record, despite starting out 1-2.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Coming into the season, UCSB men's tennis was the preseason favorite in the Big West conference, returning most members of a roster that had won the league title last year. But no one expected the dominance with which the Gauchos have run through the conference""ì following their demolition of both UC Davis and UC Riverside over the weekend, both by a score of 7-0, Santa Barbara heads into their matchup with first place Cal Poly with a combined 28-0 score through their first four conference matches. With the two wins, UCSB has now won seven straight matches, including two road wins against ranked opponents, to improve to 15-6 overall and 4-0 in Big West play. In the home match against Davis on Friday""ì senior night for Captain Simon Freund and contributor Chase Masciorini""ì the Gauchos easily took care of business against an overmatched Aggies squad to get their sixth straight victory. Following an impassioned speech by Head Coach Marty Davis about the two seniors, the squad came out firing, taking the doubles point as has become the norm during Santa Barbara's win streak. Singles play gave UCSB an opportunity to show off their depth, opting to rest freshman Viktor Krustev and allowing Sophomore transfer Joseph Guillin to play at the No.1 spot""ì traditionally the spot where standout Junior Nicolas Moreno De Alboran dominates. The moves paid off, however, as every single Gaucho went on to win their match, most doing so in only two sets. On court three, Simon Freund finished his senior season unbeaten at home with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over his opponent on court three.  Since Freund's loss to Oregon, he has been playing inspired tennis, winning seven straight singles matches. Juniors Anders Holm also picked up an easy victory on court four""ì a good omen for the team going forward considering his struggles earlier in the season.  On courts five and six, spots that have plagued this team throughout the season, Freshman Joey Rotheram and Junior transfer Hironori Koyanagi also picked up tough-fought victories. And on court one, Guillin continued his unbelievable season with a two-set victory over his opponent on court one, moving his win total to 17 on the season""ì a remarkable season for a player who was unsure of his role on the team heading into the season. With the victory, the Gauchos finish the season 11-0 at home, accomplishing their pre-season goal of finishing the year undefeated at home.  With their victory over UC Riverside on Sunday, UCSB made their second goal of winning the conference that much easier to accomplish. The match against Riverside would prove to be a sort of measuring stick for how much Santa Barbara has improved as the season has moved on. The Gauchos had lost their first five road games this season and were up against a much-improved Riverside team that had just set a school record with their 15th win of the season. Despite their improvement, the Highlanders were no match for UCSB, who once again won the match 7-0. Perhaps the biggest storyline of the match occurred on court six, where Masciorini made his season debut after rehabbing an injury for almost an entire season.  After already winning the doubles point on court three, Masciorini came out firing in what could possibly be his last ever college tennis match, winning 6-1 in both sets to give the Gauchos an early lead. Despite opting to rest Moreno de Alboran for the match, Santa Barbara still displayed the dominant brand of tennis they have become so accustomed to as of late.  Guillin once again picked up a dominant victory on court one, even blanking his opponent in the second set. After moving all the way up to court three, Koyanagi was still able to pick up a two-set victory over an opponent who had already accumulated 21 wins on the season.  The Gauchos will need Koyanagi to keep that up if they hope to win the conference, and even potentially make noise at the NCAA tournament. The Gauchos now have the most important match of their season on Saturday, taking on a Cal Poly team that is also 4-0 in the conference and 17-5 overall on the season.  The match will be winner-take-all for the regular season Big West title, and will also determine the top two seeds for the Big West tournament.

sports,Gauchos Shine in Doubleheader To Earn Series Win,16-Apr-18,12:40 AM,"['Annika Pearson', 'Andrew Strauss']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-16/gauchos-shine-in-doubleheader-to-earn-series-win/,"Alyssa Diaz catches the ball to get the runner out. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB softball team shined just as brightly as the skies of Isla Vista this Saturday, securing two wins in their doubleheader against Hawaii to conclude the weekend series with a win. The Gauchos pulled off a six-inning 8-0 mercy to start the day and carried their momentum into the second game as they battled the Rainbow Wahine into extra innings, ultimately executing a narrow 6-5 win. Both UCSB and Hawaii reach just below the .500 mark with 4-5 records in Big West play thus far, however, Santa Barbara is 17-25 overall and Hawai'i is 20-17. Nonetheless, the Gauchos appear to be on the rise, as they are now competitively sitting much more comfortably amongst their Big West competitors in the five spot. In what began as a pitchers' duel in the first inning, the team's offense successfully broke away from Hawaii early on and showed a much more aggressive side than we have seen lately. Fueled by Hawaii's defensive shortcomings including a throwing error and a walk in the second inning, the lineup produced two runs with just two hits. Hawaii's Callee Heen, however, responded fiercely to her team's complacency. The junior catcher hit a monstrous home run, her 13th of the 2018 season, driving in two runs to tie the game in the fourth. Compiled on top of a competitive .296 batting average, the power-hitter boasts a 0.543 slugging percentage. Nonetheless, the Gauchos immediately countered their opponent's advancements. Freshman Sammy Fabian began what became a four-hit rally, singling through the left side. The left fielder has consistently dominated offensively throughout the season and is batting .362, the team's highest overall batting average. Alyssa Diaz, Genesis Ramirez, and Rayna Cohen followed suit, in total racking up three runs for Santa Barbara, making the score 5-2. Diaz, the sophomore first-baseman, has been a standout offensive tool for the Gauchos so far in conference play. Her .464 batting average towers high above the rest as she has had 13 hits in only 28 at-bats. After going on a four-game dry streak, center fielder Rayna Cohen went 2 for 3 in the game and 3 for 5 in the series. Cohen now has five RBIs in Big West play and can hopefully use this momentum to continue to boost her both her batting average and confidence at the plate. Challenged once again by Hawaii's relentless offense, the Gauchos found themselves with a tie-game come the bottom of the seventh and multiple extra innings loomed ahead if the stagnancy continued. Freshman Maci Fines, who flaunts a .393 batting average in the conference, came in clutch with a walk-off single to right center. Though its offense's execution at the plate played a vital role in the successful outcome of the series, UCSB's solid defense cannot go unnoticed. Let this series be a preview for those to come as the Gauchos' lack of consistency on the mound has been, for now, halted. Felisha Noriega appeared in both games. The sophomore pitched a shutout, allowing just two hits, to begin the day as she watched her team mercilessly pile on eight runs against their opponent. Noriega has pitched the most innings of the five-person lineup and has maintained a 4.59 ERA. Senior Lena Mayer came in as Noriega's reliever in the second game, shutting down the Hawaii offense in two last crucial innings. That being said, the Gauchos' offense will also not be taken for granted in their high scoring blowout. Amidst a total of 11 hits, there were two doubles and a home-run. Over the span of the doubleheader, Santa Barbara impressively totaled 21 hits. From here, it seems the Gauchos may have finally found their groove. Their success in this doubleheader has revealed their ability to maximize both their offense and defense games, and the team will ideally carry it on into their next series of the Big West conference. UCSB's next series will be against Long Beach State at home next weekend.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus It was perhaps the closest fought opponent of the season, but the Gauchos ultimately fell by a 3-0 sweep score against the Anteaters. This result now puts the Gauchos back at a sub .500 winning record, at an 11-12 overall, 4-6 in Big West play on the season. With the last game now in the books, UCSB has recorded a 7-5 record when at home, compared to its 4-7 total when away from home. In terms of conference play, this loss puts Santa Barbara at No. 5 in the Big West standings. That last bit of information is especially important now that the Big West Tournament seeding has now been completed. UCSB just couldn't find their momentum as they were defeated on the road at UCI. Defensively speaking, they were outmatched as Irvine won the majority of net encounters, 11 total blocks to Santa Barbara's only 1 block. The hitting percentage also reflects this script as the home side was attacking at .456, whilst the latter put up a .260. Set 1 got out of hand for the visitors fairly early as UCI broke free at 18-11. Hardly any mistakes were actually observed on the Gauchos side; however, the Anteaters just seemed on top of things throughout it all and managed to close out the set and earn the first win of the night at a fairly comfortable score of 25-18. UCSB came out the gates effectively in the second set as they had UCI on the ropes for the majority of it. It was the usual cast of players who lead the way, with the exception of Gaucho sophomore outside hitter Roy McFarland who helped maintain the lead late into it; McFarland would also go on and lead all players in the attacking category as he earned himself 12 kills on the night. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara's defense started to falter nearing the end of the set as they conceded the lead and was forced into overtime tallies. A back to back score later from the home side and the Gauchos had lost the set by a deep 28-30 set result. The previous set proved to be very disappointing as the visitors failed to maintain their advantage, yet they didn't allow that to affect their aggressive mentality in the third set as the Gauchos soon found themselves in the lead once more. At 13-11, the visitors seemed to be in the driver's seat in this one. Still, momentum shifted back to the hosts as the Anteaters continued to pepper on the back to back scores. This streakiness of scoring eventually proved to be the downfall of Santa Barbara as they once more allowed the lead to slip away from them. In the end, it was Irvine who came out on top again as they secured the 3-0 clean sweep with a third set victory of 25-21. † The first two seeds, reserved for first place Long Beach State and second place the University of Hawai'i, will receive first-round byes during the quarterfinals. As for the Gauchos, they will face off against CSUN this Thursday as the postseason gets underway. In terms of their bracket, if UCSB beats CSUN they will then face off on the road against Long Beach State. Regardless, this is sure to be an exciting group of games as the conference teams look to start off the first inaugural Big West Tournament with a bang. The Gauchos will play down at Long Beach State's Walter Pyramid in their game against CSUN this Thursday, April 19th, at 7 PM.

sports,"UCSB Hopes To Bounce Back From Conf. Series Loss at Irvine, Faces USC Under The Lights",17-Apr-18,2:20 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-17/ucsb-hopes-to-bounce-back-from-conf-series-loss-facing-usc-under-the-lights/,"Silent preparation before getting ready to step up to home plate. Angie Banks/Daily Nexus After dropping two of three to UC Irvine this past weekend, the UCSB baseball team will look to bounce back as it takes on Pac-12 foe, USC for its second-midweek matchup against them this season. UCSB heads to Los Angeles boasting a 16-15-1 overall record and is currently even in conference play with a 3-3 mark. Similarly, USC hosts its†opponents with a 17-14 overall mark and 6-9 conference record. Against USC during the Andrew Checketts era, Santa Barbara has typically done well it has defeated the Pac-12 team eight out of its 11 meetings. Last time out,†however, against the Trojans, things did not fare too well for the Gauchos who were playing in the comfort of their own home and still were defeated handily 9-3. The loss stopped a four-game winning streak the ""òChos†held against USC. In that match-up, USC busted out 15 hits and hurt starter Ben Brecht early. With one out in the third, the lefty southpaw was already relieved of duty after allowing five hits and two earned runs. Subsequently, on the other side, USC's John Beller finished his day tossing 6.0 innings, giving up five hits and two runs, while striking out four in just his first collegiate start for the men of Troy. One of the bright spots on the day was junior shortstop Clay Fisher who banged out two hits on the day and brought in two RBI's courtesy of his first and only home run of the season. Now, two weeks later, the storylines are completely different. At that point in the season, UCSB went into that game one match below .500. This time they are one game above it. In general, Santa Barbara has also won five of its last seven since its last meeting with USC. And, despite dropping two of three to Irvine this past weekend, UCSB still showed vital signs of a strong team earning its first road win of the season with a 16-hit, nine-run performance in its win on Saturday. A midweek win against USC on Tuesday would go a long way to showing†how resilient this team is. However, in order to do that, it will need strong contributions from players like Fisher. On the season, the La Quinta native is currently slashing .271/.317/.383 and, more importantly, is back on the field defensively as he made his first appearances on the season at second base this past weekend. Similarly, it will try to get center fielder Tommy Jew back on track as before his 0-3 outing against UC Irvine on Sunday, the sophomore was riding a four-game hitting streak and went 6-17 with three RBI's and three doubles. These two along with others will try to carry an offense that, through eight games so far in April, has stayed hot with a .275/.370/.416 slash line with six home runs. UCSB will also need a strong outing from Brecht. In his last outing against LMU in last week's midweek match-up, the Wilmette native put up a much more valiant effort allowing seven hits and two earned runs while striking out three to earn the win. Brecht will need to put together a strong performance as he faces someone like freshman infielder Ben Ramirez who has gone 8-20 with seven RBI's in his last five outings. The last time he played UCSB, he went 1-4. Guys like Chase Bushor and Kaleb Murphy will also be a handful as the junior and redshirt sophomore are both batting over .300 with 10 and two RBI's respectively. Junior infielder Dillion Paulson leads the team in RBI's with 23 and is currently batting .248 at the plate. He went 1-3 with two RBI's against the Gauchos last time out. In the grand scheme of things, this game won't mean much as the ""òChos season continues onward. Santa Barbara needs to win the regular season conference title to make the postseason and defeating USC does not change that. However, there is something to be said for momentum. And after earning its first road win of the season this past weekend, it would be safe to assume the Gauchos would like to earn their second before heading back into conference play, on the road, against UC Davis beginning this Friday. UCSB takes on USC at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, April 17th at Dedeaux Field.

Angie Banks/Daily Nexus It's a short week for the UCSB men's volleyball team this time around, as the Gauchos are heading down to Long Beach State's Walter Pyramid for the first inaugural Big West Tournament. The conference tournament is set to begin this Thursday when Santa Barbara goes up against CSUN for the first round of this conference postseason event. This first round of the tournament will feature a very familiar foe in CSUN.
UCSB has lined up on the opposite side of the court twice already against the Matadors during the regular season. The result between the two matches ultimately resulted in a 1-1 split ""î a win for the Gauchos at home and a loss while on the road ""î but expectations for the Blue and Gold still remain high. Upon the conclusion of the Big West's first league season, the CSUN Matadors were able to vault over the Gauchos in terms of league standings. This occurred after they earned back-to-back wins against UC San Diego and as Santa Barbara allowed a 1-1 split versus UC Irvine. As a result, UCSB's fifth seed spot puts them in second to last in the Big West, at a 4-6 conference record, whilst CSUN finished just above them with a flat .500 overall of 5-5 in league play. In terms of national standings, UCSB is the No. 12 program in the nation in the latest Men's Volleyball Division 1 poll. The Gauchos' current overall record has them at 11-12 on the year, a .478 when it comes to winning percentage. Their best ball has been played at home, 7-5, while on the road their record has been 4-7. Most recently, Santa Barbara is 1-3 in the month of April. CSUN is also nationally ranked. As voted, they currently find themselves as a top 10 program at the No. 9 spot in Division 1 Men's Volleyball. The Matadors stand at an overall record of 15-10 on the season at a .600 win percentage. Northridge has so far excelled in its service aces, where they are second in the Big West with 139, only behind No. 1 Long Beach State. When it comes to home and neutral play, they boast a comfortable 13-3 result. However, they tend to falter when away from home as they put up a lowly 2-7 while on the road. In the month of April, CSUN is split at 2-2 and is currently coming off a two-game winning streak. Standout performers for the Gauchos remain sophomore opposite Keenan Sanders and junior outside hitter Corey Chavers. Between the two, they combine for a total of 502 kills on the year, practically half of the team's total kills for the season. Sophomore setter Randy DeWeese also continues to run the show as he holds 609 total assists throughout all play under his name. As for CSUN, senior opposite Arvis Greene is the clear-cut attacking leader as he totals 349 kills on offense on the year, almost 100 more kills than the runner-up on his team and good for the most in the Big West. He'll be thanking junior setter Sam Porter, who has tallied a total of 678 assists overall, for his help. Historically speaking, the odds are in the Gauchos' favor as they hold the leading advantage over CSUN with a series record of 53-40. UCSB is also 4-1 in the last five matches against CSUN, the Matadors' single victory over them this year, and their obvious overall improvement, being the outliers in this statistic. It's sure to be a close and exciting one this Thursday, April 19, as the Gauchos will be set to play versus the Matadors at approximately 7:30 p.m. A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 19th, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Athlete Spotlight: Sophomore Pitcher Chris Lincoln,19-Apr-18,5:07 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/athlete-spotlight-sophomore-pitcher-chris-lincoln/,"Nexus File Photo During his freshman season, the Moreno Valley native accumulated a 4.82 ERA with a 1-3 record. This year, Lincoln has turned that around and is currently sporting a 1.96 ERA with a 2-1 record and a career high 35 strikeouts. And, as a starter, the sophomore has been even better, allowing just seven earned runs in five starts with two of those being wins. Even before coming to UCSB, Lincoln was a highly touted recruit that was selected in the 13th round of the MLB draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. Luckily for everyone involved with the UCSB baseball program, Lincoln chose Santa Barbara. We were also lucky enough to catch up with Lincoln before the Gauchos' big series against UC Davis and had some fun; here are the best highlights from that interview.† Jorge Mercado: Where is your confidence level at this season and how has it been adjusting to the starting rotation?† Chris Lincoln: I have felt really good lately, I just stay grinding and try to keep everything in front of me. This is still a learning experience for me, and I know I still have a lot to learn, but I just want to put my team in the best position to win and I think I have done a decent job so far. It's been a lot of mental focusing this year and trying to attack hitters more this season, and it's paid off.† JM: What was the most fun of the recruiting process? †CL: First off, the recruiting process was really hectic. It is easy to get overwhelmed with it, but the most fun part was getting calls from these coaches from all these different schools. That first call or first text from a new coach that says they are showing interest in you is really enjoyable because all your hard work is paying off even before you turn 18. I sometimes wish I could go back and live it all again because it was so enjoyable, but I know I made the best decision in coming to UC Santa Barbara and I would never change that for the world. JM: What got you into baseball and why did you stick with it? CL: I started playing when I was about four, and being athletic growing up I played all sports like football, basketball and track but there was something about baseball that I excelled at better. I was good at other sports, but I was just that much better as baseball and I rode that all the way to college and hopefully I could keep playing for a long time. †JM: Is there a team you would love to play for at the next level? CL: Honestly, growing up in Southern California, you see how much of a diehard fanbase the Dodgers have, and I would love to be a part of their organization. I would also love to play for the Yankees, and that would be a dream come true. JM: If you could pick any other sport to play and be great at, what would it be? CL: I would pick basketball because I am kind of a flashy guy for the most part, and when you're playing baseball and you're on the field you have to reel it in a bit because baseball is more of a conservative game. If I was really good at basketball, it would be a bit easier to let my personality go and show my flashy side. JM: If you could create the perfect pitcher, who would you model him after? CL: He would probably look just like Clayton Kershaw because I just can't think of anything wrong with him. I could breakdown a perfect pitcher, but honestly I would just end up breaking down Kershaw. JM: Do you play Fortnite? How good are you? CL: I just started getting into it, and I am much later than my friends because it didn't look that enjoyable, but man, once you get into that first game, you just have to keep playing more and more, so I have been on it for a couple weeks now. I am so close to getting my first win and that makes it so much more agonizing because you keep getting top five, top three and then you make a simple mistake and lose. I will get there, though, and soon. JM: Favorite thing about UCSB and its culture? CL: I love the people. I mean the weather, the baseball team, all that is so great, but people and environment are so friendly and inviting. Everyone is so nice out here and they make it easy to fall in love with this place. JM: Favorite Andrew Checketts moment? CL: Checks does not really have a big personality, he is pretty straight forward and serious a lot of the time, but there is one drill we do where us as pitchers, we have to try to make plays off him, and he is trying to beat us with the ball, and that is when his personality really comes out. He has gotten some good laughs out of me. JM: What legacy do you want to leave here at UCSB? CL: I want people to remember me as a guy who was a model of what it looks like to be a pitcher. I want people to look back on me and tell the future generations of Gaucho pitchers that ""úthat guy""ù is what it looks like to pitch here. I just want future pitchers to look back and say that's the guy I want to be like. A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the April 19th, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Blue-Green Rivalry Renewed in Winner-Takes-All Final Match of the Reg. Season,19-Apr-18,5:06 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/blue-green-rivalry-renewed-in-winner-takes-all-final-match-of-the-reg-season/,"Chasing the ball. Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus UCSB men's tennis team can do no wrong lately ""î they have won seven games in a row, including three victories on the road. In their four conference victories, they have yet to give up a single point to their opponent. Saturday, they will put their season on the line in a winner-take-all matchup against an unexpectedly superb Cal Poly team that has won five games in a row. Both teams enter the match 4-0 in the conference, meaning the stakes couldn't be higher. Winner takes the regular season conference title and the top seed in the Big West tournament, while the loser must settle for the second seed. ""úI feel we're beginning to peak at the right time, with all of our biggest matches in front of us,""ù Gaucho Head Coach Marty Davis said. Last season, the Mustangs finished ranked No. 49 after an 18-8 season, the most wins in school history. With a victory over the Gauchos, the Mustangs would tie that record, putting their overall record at 18-5 heading into the Big West tournament. Statistically, Cal Poly seems to have a strong advantage playing at home ""î on the season, they are 11-0 at home, while UCSB is only 3-5 on the road. However, most of those losses came earlier in the season, when Santa Barbara was struggling to find its identity. Additionally, UCSB holds the all-time record against Cal Poly, winning 19 of the 32 matches the two sides have played. ""úI'm interested to see how we play in front of a hostile environment,""ù Davis said. ""úI know we're going to be up for the test.""ù In order to mitigate home-court advantage, Santa Barbara will have to win the doubles point ""î something that hasn't been Cal Poly's strong suit this season, particularly at the No. 1 spot. On the season, the Mustangs are just 7-9 at that spot; therefore, juniors Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm will look to pick up one of the two victories necessary for the doubles point. Similar to the Gauchos, the Mustangs are a top-heavy squad when it comes to singles play. Junior Josh Ortlip has dominated opponents at the one spot, winning 14 of his 18 matches and riding a four-game winning streak heading into the match. Moreno de Alboran, who remains unbeaten in his last seven matches and is ranked 80th in the country, will have to be on his A-game in order to get the victory. Likewise, Australian junior Dominic Bechard has won 11 of his 13 matches on court two, posing a threat to UCSB sophomore Joseph Guillin, who has only lost two matches the entire season. The top two courts will likely be the deciding factor on Saturday, so Guillin will have to keep his hot hand if the Gauchos are to win. Where the Mustangs have stumbled, however, is at the bottom two singles courts. On court five, Cal Poly has a 9-9 record on the season, while on court six they are 10-7. These numbers pale in comparison to the team's overall record, and will likely provide the Gauchos' best opportunity to pick up points. However, UCSB has also been inconsistent, especially at the number six position. On court five, freshman Victor Krustev has stepped up despite his age, winning his last two matches in straight sets. What remains to be seen, however, is who will play at the number six position for UCSB. After struggling earlier in the year, junior Hironori Koyanagi dominated in his last match, while senior Chase Masciorini picked up an easy victory on court six following a one year layoff of playing tennis. No matter who plays, Santa Barbara will need those points in order to have a cushion if their top players slip up. There's no doubt UCSB has the talent to keep up with Cal Poly ""î they've proved that all year. On the road, with the regular season title on the line, they will need to display that talent ""î along with the poise and confidence they've had of late ""î in order to celebrate a title in SLO. The Gauchos will take on Cal Poly at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the Mustang Courts. Comments are closed.

Less than 500 feet away ""î away from the noise and excitement ""î senior Chase Masciorini sat in the driver's seat of his car, surrounded only by deafening silence and self-doubt. ""úWas this the end?""ù he thought to himself, mind racing, heart pounding. After years of grueling practices, waking up early for stadium runs, proving his worth to the coaches, was he going to abandon his first love just like that? After six months of failed treatments, sheer frustration and mediocre tennis, Masciorini had hit his breaking point. As an underclassmen, Masciorini likely would have turned to worldly pleasures to ignore his disdain ""î partying, drinking, all the ""útypical college things""ù he was so well known for on the team. But that was the old Masciorini ""î the one who struggled with fulfillment in his life, who struggled to live up to the immense pressure he placed on himself on the tennis court. Instead, still alone in his car, he closed his eyes and prayed, asking God for advice. ""úI felt like, in that moment, God told me to keep going and persevere, which was hard to hear because it had been five months of struggling and quitting really looked the most appealing,""ù he said. ""úAt that moment, I made a decision I wasn't going to let the injury defeat me. I knew neither solution was ideal, but I trusted God that something good would come out of it.""ù Long before that defining moment, before the injury that would plague him for so long, Masciorini was a sophomore struggling to get his chance on the court. He played only one singles match all season, losing on court six, and his partying habits were starting to catch up to him. Discontent, Masciorini knew he needed to change something""¶ he just wasn't sure what. ""úI realized a lot of what I was doing wasn't making me happy. The more I did it [party], the more empty I felt and the more stressful the other aspects of my life were,""ù he said. ""úI tried focusing on being a better person, but that didn't change [my habits].""ù Masciorini finally decided to give up all that dissatisfaction in exchange for ""úpeace, joy, happiness.""ù He decided to turn to God, to become a more religious man. Along with gaining a new perspective on life, the decision enabled Masciorini to finally play freely on the court. No longer was he just playing for himself ""î he was playing for something greater. ""úIt took all the pressure off""¶ I no longer felt like my failures defined me, so now I was just stoked to get to play tennis,""ù he said. That change proved to be fruitful on the court. Without the added burden on himself, Masciorini developed into one of the team's most consistent contributors, developing a niche for himself at the number six spot. At that spot, he won 10 of his 15 matches on the season, helping the team to their third straight conference title. Still, something just felt a little bit off. At the advice of the trainers, Masciorini took a few weeks off from playing tennis after the season ended in hopes of letting his injury heal naturally. But when he came back, the hip just felt worse. ""úThe hip was way more tight when I came back, so I decided to take another three weeks off to do physical therapy,""ù he said. ""úI ended up not playing tennis for a month and a half after the injury.""ù His frustration started to mount as the pain refused to go away, ultimately culminating during that fateful December day. After God told him to persevere, Masciorini decided to get a CT scan on his injury. That scan revealed inflammation in his SI joint, a joint he had completely ignored in his rehabilitation efforts. ""úIt was frustrating because I knew with the right diagnosis in the first place I could have been back in fall,""ù Masciorini said. Now, Masciorini was in a race against the clock. On Jan. 13, just before the team's first regular season match, he resumed practicing ""î his first fully healthy practice in more than six months. He knew he wouldn't be able to contribute on the court for the majority of the season, his last in a UCSB uniform. Instead, he made a decision: he would do everything he could to help the team, no matter how unorthodox. ""úWe have a policy here: team first,""ù he said. ""úI really buy into that concept, so I decided if I can't contribute in the way that I'm used to, then I'm going to do everything in my ability to help us win, whether it be cheering or helping the new guys and the coaches.""ù At first, this proved to be an adjustment for Masciorini; he knew he wanted to help, but had a hard time swallowing his pride. All of last year, Masciorini had only focused on warming up for the match. Suddenly, he was thrust into setting up for the match, a role that freshmen typically perform. But as Masciorini became more content with his situation, he began to truly embrace the various roles he would take on. Before the first game, Head Coach Marty Davis asked Masciorini if he would DJ and MC the home match, calling out scores and keeping the fans engaged. ""úI remember being really nervous the first time I had to MC the game, speaking into the mic and hearing my own voice,""ù Masciorini said. ""úI just try to have fun with it. The guys love it and I realized this is a way I can contribute, helping the team come together.""ù Now Masciorini's booming voice is synonymous with a home match for the Gauchos, with his electronic interludes between points bringing a sort of energy that has inspired the team to an 11-0 home record. Even when he's not on the mic, Masciorini is making his presence, a sort of presence that exudes confidence and comfort, felt at matches. In the team's March 3 home match against St Mary's, Masciorini noticed one of the Gael's players yelling at the top of his lungs throughout the doubles portion of the match, the sort of volume that would drive a grandparent crazy. ""úLet's gooooo Simon,""ù Masciorini yelled out in response, egging on teammate and senior captain Simon Freund. During that match, Masciorini made sure, no matter what, that his voice was heard. ""úI wasn't going to let this guy from the visiting team just be louder than me,""ù Masciorini said. ""úI also wanted to show the freshmen not just how to cheer, but also how to have fun with it.""ù During UCSB's March 14 match against Gonzaga, Masciorini's constant clapping and support for his teammates irritated the Bulldogs so much that a game official had to come over to warn him about ""útaunting.""ù Yet after the game, the Gonzaga team came up to Masciorini to tell him how his cheering had thrown them off their game, helping to establish the home-court advantage that UCSB is renowned for. Through it all, Masciorini has kept the promise he told himself ""î the same statement that God told him ""î not to give up. When he first started practicing, he wasn't sure he would either fully regain where he had been the season before. ""úI had doubts. Was it really the injury, or did I just lose it?""ù he said. ""úIt had been five to six months since I had played consistently""¶ maybe I just lost my skill.""ù As he kept working, however, he began to see glimpses of what had made him such a strong player in the past, even if only for moments. Slowly, those glimpses began to morph into full sets, and soon, full matches. In a challenge match a few weeks ago, Masciorini found himself against a freshman on the team who had beaten him easily in the fall. After the initial match in fall, Masciorini found Davis' clipboard, with notes that implied that he would never contribute to the team. This match was different from the get-go. Determined to prove that he could compete ""î that, if given the opportunity, he would win at six ""î Masciorini came out firing, winning the match easily. When Davis came by to check the score, Masciorini had five simple words for him: ""úDon't count me out, coach.""ù ""úThat was a defining moment for me,""ù he said. ""úI proved that no matter what others thought, I was making the comeback I knew I could, that God knew I could.""ù After a year of helping the team off the court, of sacrificing to help the team no matter how he could, Masciorini finally got his shot against UC Riverside. It was just like the old days; Masciorini laced up, working on his forehand, backhand, ensuring his serve was strong. Before he knew it, it was game time. ""úIn a lot of ways it felt like it was my first-ever match for UCSB all over again. I was really nervous but mostly excited to be back out there,""ù he said. On the court, Masciorini demonstrated that he still had it, that he could still play at a high level. After helping his team win the doubles point, he dominated his singles opponent, winning in two sets, 6-1, 6-0. ""úIt felt like I didn't miss a beat since my last match at six,""ù he said. ""úI played really well, and it felt good that all the hours of rehab payed off.""ù As his time at Santa Barbara comes to a close, Masciorini remembers fondly one question he was asked before he came: What do you want to get out of college tennis? When he responded by saying he wanted to leave a legacy, he meant a legacy of awards and records, a legacy of on-court production. While individually that didn't come to fruition, Masciorini ultimately accomplished his goal. He has left a legacy of team success. If the Gauchos win the title, he will be only the second ever player in Santa Barbara history to be on a team that wins four consecutive conference titles. He has left a legacy of buying into the team concept, of putting the team first. And he has left a legacy of perseverance, a man of faith, a man who refused to give up despite the odds, a legacy that will serve to inspire the freshmen he mentored for years to come. Masciorini knows that match may have been his last ever in a Gaucho uniform and knows he may not be called upon to play in the postseason. But as he has done all year, Masciorini won't complain, won't grumble, but will do whatever the team needs to be successful. And, if he is called upon, don't count him out.

sports,Gauchos Look To Take Command of Conference Heading to UC Davis,19-Apr-18,9:26 AM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-19/gauchos-look-to-take-command-of-conference-heading-to-uc-davis/,"Michael McAdoo triumphantly runs towards home base. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The UCSB baseball team (17-15-1) will finish up its last leg of a seven-game road trip against the UC Davis Aggies (10-21) that has seen the Gauchos garner a 2-2 record so far, an underwhelming performance in their first foray into conference play. The last game for the Gauchos was a positive performance in Los Angeles against the University of Southern California Trojans where UCSB won 8-5. USC starter Austin Manning was solid up until the fourth inning where the sophomore gave up runs on a bases-loaded walk and two wild pitches, allowing the Gauchos to score five runs by the end of the fifth inning. Sophomore McClain O'Connor and junior Clay Fisher singled to put three runs across the plate to increase the team's lead to 8-4 by the time of the seventh inning stretch. The Aggies have not had much of an effective season and find themselves last in the Big West conference after playing nine conference games. In their last game against the Sacramento State Hornets, Davis used a four-run sixth inning powered by a sophomore Tanner Murray single and an extra-base hit from senior Brad Pluschkell to win the game, 7-3. The victory was Davis' first in over a week and is only their third in the month of April. With mostly losses intertwined between the minority victories, the Aggies are certainly hoping for a better result in their games against the Gauchos before the end of the team's current homestand. Jack Dashwood looks to be the probable starter for UCSB on Friday's opening match and the southpaw will be making a start at a point in the season where he has run into more trouble than he'd like to have seen as of late. The freshman has a 2-5 record on the year and his previous start to begin the series against UC Irvine was his worst outing on the mound all season. The 18.90 ERA and ten hits allowed over 3.1 innings pitched are all season-low marks in each category. Dashwood had been getting it together before his disastrous start against UCI, since the March 9th game against Texas State he had gone for at least five innings, allowed a less than 1.50 ERA, excluding a March 19th start, and held a 2-3 record. The lefty and his team are hoping he can bounce back to set a strong tone early in the series against Davis. Junior Ryan Anderson leads UC Davis in batting average, (.391), hits (50), and runs (26) alongside junior Caleb van Blake, who leads the team in RBIs with 28, have been major parts of the Aggie offense. In Davis' last 16-10 victory, both Anderson and van Blake homered in the game with van Blake's shot being a huge grand slam in the third inning to tie up the score. For a team who has not done a lot of winning this season, in the games, the Aggies have won offense has not been a problem as all of their victories have come when the team has scored seven or more runs. The key to victory for the Gauchos this series very well could lie in keeping the Aggies guessing at the plate and getting good pitching to keep them quiet. The team has a good coincidence of timing as early opportunities to jump ahead in the standings do not come often and the mindset for UCSB must be to come out strong should they desire to quickly improve their record. The Gauchos will begin their series against the Aggies on Friday, April 20 ""ì April 23. The first game is scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM PST.

sports,No. 12/5th-Seeded Gauchos Eliminated From Big West Tournament,20-Apr-18,9:26 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-20/no-12-5th-seeded-gauchos-eliminated-from-big-west-tournament/,"Spencer Fredrick gets a point for his team. Angie Banks / Daily Nexus It was an exciting night for some postseason volleyball down at Long Beach State's Walter Pyramid. The matchup, a fifth-seeded UCSB going up against fourth seed CSUN. Considering the tournament's single-elimination setup, this game would prove to be either the one to take the winning team to their next round opponent in No. 1 Long Beach State or be the last game of the season for the other side. Unfortunately, it didn't go quite as planned for the Gauchos, as they dropped this matchup by a final result of 1-3. The competition got underway fairly evenly at first, as the Gauchos and Matadors went back and forth, keeping it tied all the way up to 12-12 in the first set. Then a small CSUN advantage was quelled as Santa Barbara fought back to keep it within 2 at 16-18. Ultimately, the Gauchos would get outscored drastically around this halfway mark, as the Matadors went on to close out the set on 7 scores; compared to UCSB's 2 scores past this point, it would essentially set up the set 1 loss for the Gauchos at a result of 18-25. UCSB then immediately picked up the pace and brought forward a strong performance for the closest set of the night. In the second, the Gauchos came out to a commanding lead as they opened 3-0 off an ace, error, and kill. They would go on to maintain this 4 point advantage all the way to a 9-5 score. The lead would eventually falter, however, as a flurry of errors halfway through the set forced them to call a timeout. Soon after, the Matadors' newfound momentum was enough to bring it back level at 14-14. Things started to slow down at this point as both sides experienced lead changes and ties aplenty. Now into the late set numbers, both sides found themselves tied once more at 27-27. It seemed like it was anyone's game at this point and it seemed to favor the Gauchos as they went up by a point following a CSUN service error. In the end, UCSB couldn't make the most of the situation as a pair of CSUN kills and an opposing attacking error gave the Matadors the hard fought 30-28 win in set 2. Set 3 showed that the Gauchos came out to play with something to prove as they came out of the gates full speed in this one. Putting on perhaps one of their best sets of the entire season, UCSB started off with a comfortable 5-0 opening that soon turned into a 10-2 lead. It would pretty much remain at this immense gap as the Matadors just seemed lost and out of rhythm for most of it. The third set would then clearly go to the Gauchos as the final tally was a wide result of 25-12. With the momentum now in full swing, the Gauchos knew they'd take this set too if they replicated even half the level of play in the previous one. However, the Matadors had recollected themselves and returned to their former quality as both sides always kept it within a couple throughout the entirety of set 4. A half hour of exciting and competitive play later and spectators were biting their nails at the sight of a 26-26 score nearing its finale. Both sides played their hearts out and gifted volleyball fans a game to remember, yet the victor in this one was CSUN as a pair of back to back kills gave them the 28-26 win to close out the night. Game leaders included Gaucho junior outside hitter Corey Chavers who led all attackers with a whopping 21 kills. UCSB's junior middle blocker in Connor Drake also put up a match-leading of 8 great blocks on the night. As this year's men's volleyball calendar now comes to a close, UCSB finishes with an 11-13 overall record on the year.

sports,Long Beach State Rolls Over Gauchos In Sat. Doubleheader,22-Apr-18,5:50 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-22/long-beach-state-rolls-over-gauchos-in-sat-doubleheader/,"Alyssa Diaz runs to first base to tag out Hawaii player. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus No. 18 Long Beach State swept the UCSB softball team in back-to-back games, stomping out the potential for a Gaucho series win this weekend. Saturday's set had the potential to boost Santa Barbara's Big West record over .500 for the first time this conference; however, the losses put the team behind as they now sport a 4-7 in-conference record and are currently 17-27 on the season. Long Beach State, on the other hand, now boasts an impressive 35-9 overall record. The two wins increase their conference record to 9-2 and help keep them in close standing with CSUN in their fight for the Big West number one spot. The Gauchos' first game seemed more promising than the second; the team held their own and even outhit Long Beach in what resulted in a narrow 5-3 loss. However, come the second game, Long Beach pulled far ahead in a lofty 10-2 win. Long Beach State's lineup consistently pressured the Gaucho defense in their most recent matchup, putting up runs in six of the seven innings. With four of their hitters batting .500 and over in the game, Long Beach accumulated 12 hits, a mixture of singles, doubles, and home runs. First baseman Taylor Rowland led her team offensively, going 2 for 3 at the plate. The sophomore has four RBI's on the day, three of which came from her hefty homer in the sixth inning, increasing Long Beach's lead from 6-1 to 9-1. Her high-range batting average sits tall at 0.381, but amongst her teammates only comes up to be the third highest. Statistically, Long Beach's domination at the plate should not have come as a surprise to the Gauchos, not one of its girls' batting average stoops below .240 in the ten-batter lineup. The team's top two hitters, Naomi Hernandez and Nichole Fry, have a combined 121 hits in the overall season and both are sporting a stunning .400 averages. Each girl contributed two singles in the second game. Though admittedly it would not have changed the outcome of the game seeing as the Gauchos did not produce the baserunners they needed, UCSB turned in a lackluster defensive performance. With three errors, the girls indirectly allowed three unearned runs. They pushed through three different pitchers including sophomore Felisha Noriega who took the loss in the books for Santa Barbara. The first game of the day, however, exposed a very different, much more competitive UCSB team than the series result indicates. The Gauchos kept Long Beach State on its toes the entire game, holding them to only three runs up until the sixth inning while putting up two of their own. UCSB pitcher Emily Schuttish had the game on lock, practically shutting down Long Beach's three biggest hitting threats previously mentioned. The freshman demonstrated control on the mound, allowing only a humble five hits. Schuttish holds the lowest ERA of the Santa Barbara pitching lineup at 2.81. The game as a whole was slow-moving, at a stand-still even for three of the seven innings. It was not until the sixth inning that the Gauchos gained some offensive momentum for themselves, scoring two of their three runs. Seven hits came out of the lineup, two more than their competitors. Junior Sierra Altmeyer showed poise at the plate, singling and doubling to come out of the game with a .666 average. So far in Big West, the second baseman has six RBI's, the most on the team. It was not until the last inning that Long Beach State was able to pull out the win. Long Beach's right fielder and senior vet, Julia Lombardi, came out strong with a two-run homer that began and ended a two out rally for her team. From there, the Gauchos responded, promptly putting baserunners on in order to execute a traditional scoring method that got them just one run. After back-to-back outs to end the game, the Gauchos were left two runs short of a win. UCSB has one last shot at redemption today, Sunday, at 1pm where they look to conclude the series against Long Beach on a high note.

sports,No. 18 49ers Complete Three Game Sweep Of Gauchos,23-Apr-18,5:59 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-23/no-18-49ers-complete-three-game-sweep-of-gauchos/,"Sierra Altmeyer makes contact with the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus Coming off late inning heroics in their last outing, the Gaucho bats didn't have the same pop this weekend as the No. 18 Long Beach State 49ers walked all over the UCSB softball team. Santa Barbara was swept in three straight at home, losing games 1 and 2 by scores of 5-3 and 10-2 respectively and ultimately dropping the series finale by a score of 4-1. The Gauchos now sit at 17-28 overall on the season, and 4-8 in Big West Conference play. This sweep continues an alarming trend for UCSB, which is that when the team begins to show signs of life, a solemn series often follows. They've only won consecutive series once this season, and that lack of consistency is a big reason Santa Barbara has now dropped to seventh place out of eight teams in the Big West Conference. To be fair, it's typical to have great disparity in any game in which nationally ranked Long Beach is competing. The 49ers boast a 36-9 holistic record on the season and have dominated Big West play with an 11-2 conference record, leading to them being the only conference representative in the NCAA Top 25. One only has to look at LBSU's pitching staff to understand their dominance so far. Niners sophomore ace Cielo Meza took control of the Gauchos early in the series finale and hope seemed to diminish slowly as Meza was lights out on the rubber. The righty went 4.2 innings while allowing 2 hits,1 earned run, and 8 punchouts. She struggled with her location at times and offered up 8 walks in the process but kept Gaucho bats quiet otherwise. Meza improved her record to 20-3 on the season, now sporting a 1.39 ERA- both marks are good for the best in the Big West Conference. She continues to blow by batters by adding to her conference best strikeout total at 187 K's on the year, 22 more punchouts than the next highest pitcher has this season. When the ""òChos began to threaten after a couple of Meza walks in the fifth, Senior pitcher Jessica Flores trotted to the circle and took command of the final three innings. Flores picked up her eighth win on the season in game 2 on Saturday and came in to close out Sunday's finale for her eighth relief appearance of the year. Flores continued the Niners dominance by allowing a mere two hits and no earned runs over 2.1 innings pitched. This improves her save total to 3 on the season, good for first in the conference as she shares the title with her fellow Niner teammate in Devyn Magnett. UCSB was unable to capitalize on Long Beach misses as the Gauchos left 12 base runners stranded, an almost extraordinary number against the stingy 49er pitching staff. This offensive inefficiency is not something that the Gauchos will be looking to replicate in their next series, as scoring only one run while being walked 10 times will not lead to many victories Although Santa Barbara struggled at the plate on Sunday, they managed to improve their effort on defense and erase the errors which have plagued them this year. With no outs in the top of the fifth, Long Beach junior shortstop Nichole Fry hit a shot into the gap in deep left center. Freshman left field standout Sammy Fabian robbed what was sure be an extra base hit as she laid out and made a spectacular diving catch to curb the Niners momentum and keep the Gauchos close. Fabian got the jump she needed as the ball left the bat and read it perfectly to close the gap just in the nick of time to make a premier snag on a ball that was dropping quickly. It seems that off the field work has made a difference as the year has worn on. ""úLots of practice""¶ we've been doing so much work, specifically on (gappers), so I saw it and just went for it,""ù Fabian answered postgame when asked about how she made the play. The freshman is leading the Gauchos in batting average and hitting .346 on the year. Not only is she prone to getting on base with a .403 on base percentage, but Fabian also possesses unique speed on the base path. She has stolen 9 bases this season, good for fourth most in the Big West Conference. Her stellar offensive play was definitely a bright spot for UCSB in an otherwise rough sweep. Fabian and the rest of the UCSB (17-28, 4-8) squad shift their attention to Cal State Northridge (18-32, 3-9) and a three-game away series in Los Angeles next weekend. The Gauchos have a doubleheader on Saturday, April 28 and will polish off the rest series on the following Sunday, April 29.

sports,Meta Mock Draft: Breaking Down The First Round Of The 2018 NFL Draft,25-Apr-18,5:30 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-25/meta-mock-draft-breaking-down-the-first-round-of-the-2018-nfl-draft/,"Photo Courtesy of the NFL The 2018 NFL Draft is soon approaching, and just like us you're probably sifting through mock draft after mock draft of your favorite team's projections. Whether you agree or disagree with that particular writer's estimate, you're next move would probably be to wait for an updated version or to look through a different mock draft altogether. Well look no further, not only will we give you the most in-depth mock draft but we'll do so with science. Yes, science. Specifically speaking, we'll be working with the science behind a Meta-analysis. This form of statistical analysis combines the results of multiple scientific (or in this case: mock draft) studies, in order to find a conceptually common truth. Confused? To simplify, we randomly selected the mock drafts of 25 of today's top sports world analysts and isolated their popular majority per player, per draft pick. Thus, after all the dirty work and number crunching, including our opinion on each overall draft position; we present to you the Round 1 Meta Mock Draft: † Cleveland Browns No.1) Sam Darnold, QB, USC After passing up on several franchise QB's in past drafts, the Browns will want to get this one right and get the most pro-ready college quarterback this year. Darnold has deep ball ability and can make the most of a broken play. Cleveland can see him being the guy at the helm for years to come. † New York Giants  No.2) Saquon Barkley, RB, Penn State  New York could've gone with several positions that would bolster any key weaknesses in the team's core. Regardless, they keep it rolling with Eli Manning and give him an offensive weapon that'll help take the pressure off. Saquon Barkley is this draft's player with the most big play ability and can change a game's outcome all by himself. The Giants will make sure to feed him the ball plenty, as well as utilize his immense agility by having him pass catch out the backfield. † New York Jets No.3) Baker Mayfield, QB, Oklahoma Baker Mayfield was the star of the show in Oklahoma and was able to lead his side to the college football playoff semifinals. Behavioral issues aside, he's perhaps the most underrated QB in this draft. The Jets have quietly been putting together a team that'll hopefully look to compete at a high level in the next few seasons to come, Mayfield seems to be that missing offensive piece and face of the franchise that they need. † Cleveland Browns No.4) Bradley Chubb, DE, North Carolina State Bradley Chubb is easily the most talented pass rusher of his draft class. So the Browns will pounce on the thought of having him line up opposite of last year's draft DE stud Myles Garrett. Chubb has the speed to chase down halfbacks and the strength to make opposing O-linemen look silly, seems like an easy choice at No. 4 for Cleveland. † Denver Broncos No.5) Josh Allen, QB, Wyoming It has been quite a while seen we've last seen a QB sling the ball as hard and as accurate as Josh Allen does. Every time he starts it seems like the Wyoming star is going to put on a show, and his highlight reels will make this case for him to go even higher than expected in the draft. Denver is still looking for their main man at quarterback, and even if he doesn't start, the Broncos believe he has the potential to eventually answer the call down the line. † Indianapolis Colts No.6) Quenton Nelson, G, Notre Dame The reason Andrew Luck is having the health questions he's been experiencing is because of O-line issues; this lead him to getting hit several times each game during the last season he played. Quenton Nelson will help resolve this issue as the Colts will continue to rebuild their team's offensive core for the time being. † Tampa Bay Buccaneers No.7) Derwin James, S, Florida State Derwin James is perhaps the hardest hitting of this draft's secondary class. He also shows off his football IQ by reading and blowing up seemingly every defensive play he's involved in. Tampa Bay has a lot of question marks when it comes to their defense, James' immediate impact will be able turn one of those spots into an exclamation mark. † Chicago Bears No.8) Denzel Ward, CB, Ohio State Chicago will want to return to its gritty and elite defensive days of the past. Ohio State's star cornerback in Denzel Ward will be a key piece of this campaign for a better Bears secondary. Ward is one of the best tacklers for his position in this year's draft, not to mention his knack for poaching the ball no matter what way it comes to him. † San Francisco 49ers No.9) Roquan Smith, LB, Georgia  The 49ers have a great need at the linebacker position, considering NaVorro Bowman left last season and Reuben Foster from last year's draft is facing serious legal issues. Roquan Smith seems like a prime candidate to help San Francisco start again as a LB leader. Smith covers his zone really well and breaks up passes as if it's second nature to him, solid pickup at No. 9. † Oakland Raiders No.10) Minkah Fitzpatrick, S, Alabama Minkah Fitzpatrick is a defensive leader, plain and simple. He always has his eyes on the quarterback and will ""òmeet you there' every time. Additionally, he's a heck of a special teamer and the list of things he's good at just seems ever growing with every game he adds under his belt. With this selection, the Raiders find a diamond in the rough with giant red arrows pointing directly at him. † Miami Dolphins No.11) Tremaine Edmunds, LB, Virginia Tech You usually won't find anyone running nearly as fast or as hard as Tremaine Edmunds at his size. With the No. 11 spot, it would be wise for the Dolphins to keep adding to their defense by picking up Edmunds. As a versatile linebacker, we'll surely hear his name be called for either a great tackle or stripped ball all year long. † Buffalo Bills No.12) Josh Rosen, QB, UCLA Health concerns and off the field issues are perhaps the only caution signs for NFL teams to allow UCLA's quarterback to drop this far down the draft. Regardless, Josh Rosen is no doubt a top QB prospect. He can read defenses like a book and the more time he's allowed in the pocket the worse it gets for his opponents. The Bills just lost Tyrod Taylor and appears to have struck out with Nathan Peterman; if they give Rosen some time and the protection he needs, watch out. † Washington Redskins No.13) Vita Vea, DT, Washington The Redskins are another team that are also subtly building a great defensive side. In a division with quarterbacks like Carson Wentz and Dak Prescott who can be mobile when they want to, it's wise that Washington pursues an improvement in the pass rush category. Vita Vea's strength and presence on the field is that very improvement they're searching for. † Green Bay Packers No.14) Mike Hughes, CB, Central Florida For as much yards that the Packers seem to earn on offense, they eventually lose that same amount on defense. Green Bay recently lost Sam Shields to the Los Angeles Rams, and as good as Damarious Randall is, he won't be able to get the defensive back job done by himself. Mike Hughes is yet another player in this draft that is underrated. Good at man to man coverage, Hughes also intercepts passes like it's his business to, and business is booming. † Arizona Cardinals No.15) Calvin Ridley, WR, Alabama The wide receiver class in this year's draft will probably go under the radar considering other teams' quarterback and defensive priorities. Nevertheless, they remain a very talented group and Calvin Ridley appears to lead the way. Ridley is fast enough for the deep ball, big enough to win 1 on 1's, and can extend the play after the catch. The Cardinals find a great complementary piece that'll draw coverage in an offensive that seemingly revolves around star running back David Johnson. † Baltimore Ravens No.16) Lamar Jackson, QB, Louisville Joe Flacco is only getting older and the window for another spectacular Super Bowl run seems ever closing. Those running the show in Baltimore see the potential in former Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson and select him with the No. 16 overall pick. Jackson is fast, clever, and knows how to score touchdowns, all things that the Ravens can very much utilize at the quarterback position. † Los Angeles Chargers No.17) Derwin James, S, Florida State It seems like whenever Derwin James wants to tackle you, he won't go around your O-linemen, he'll go through them; or if you're lucky enough to escape the pocket, you won't find another inch if you're one on one with him. The Los Angeles Chargers' defense has arguably the most improved defense in the NFL, and they'll love to take a hard hitting tackler in Florida State's safety. † Seattle Seahawks No.18) Harold Landry, DE, Boston College The Legion of Boom has slowly calmed down these past couple of seasons, but their least flashy position was always the defensive linemen. Well, not totally true considering they had star defensive end Michael Bennett. However, he's now left Seattle for Philadelphia and there's a big hole to fill in the front seven. Reports have the Seahawks liking Harold Landry, and they'll like him even more once they see his big play ability translate to the pros. † Dallas Cowboys No.19) Courtland Sutton, WR, SMU Courtland Sutton is the epitome of a WR1. He's tall, built, and it seems like he can beat any DB in the air. After releasing Dez Bryant, Dallas will want to sign up SMU's star receiving talent right away. The Cowboys can see him one day possibly turning the young talented duo of Elliot and Prescott into a trio that takes fans of the league by storm. † Detroit Lions No.20) Da'Ron Payne, DT, Alabama Da'Ron Payne is larger than life, but his speed off the line and ability to turn on a dime won't reflect that. Alabama's star defensive tackle will attract a lot of attention from teams with this positional need, and there's plenty of reason for him to go higher than the 20th spot. The Detroit Lions get a steal in with this selection, as they continue to bolster their D-line even more. † Cincinnati Bengals No.21) Isaiah Wynn, OT, Georgia The projected second O-linemen to go in this year's draft, Isaiah Wynn played the biggest role in keeping Georgia's freshman QB safe, since Week 1 and all the way to the College Football Playoffs championship game. Wynn is an immovable force and the Bengals will need all the help they can get as they seek to keep Andy Dalton upright next season. † Buffalo Bills No.22) Leighton Vander Esch, LB, Boise State After a QB selection, the Bills' next biggest need would most likely be on defensive side of the ball. Boise State might just have an answer with their always moving, always surveying linebacker Leighton Vander Esch. Now, he may not start right away in the NFL, but he truly is a project that Buffalo will want to be a part of. † New England Patriots No.23) Kolton Miller, OT, UCLA There's a lot of speculation behind what the New England Patriots will do with the pick the Rams gave them in exchange for stud WR Brandin Cooks. Some analysts have them going receiver, others have them looking to the future and snagging a potential quarterback replacement for Tom Brady. Nope, their best option is finding help for the O-line that protects the GOAT. UCLA's Kolton Miller would be a valuable asset at the offensive tackle position, especially since former OT Nate Solder just left for the Big Apple. † Carolina Panthers No.24) Will Hernandez, G, UTEP The pattern of taking offensive linemen late in the first round of the draft continues here. The Panthers need a guard that is equal parts strong and mobile in order to protect the most out of the pocket QB in the league, Cam Newton. Will Hernandez fits both these needs and Carolina will very much appreciate everything UTEP's OG can bring to the table. † Tennessee Titans No.25) Maurice Hurst, DT, Michigan With a similar measureable, Maurice Hurst will be able to easily complement the pass rushing talents of the Titans' star DE Jurrell Casey. What Hurst lacks in size, he makes up for in speed. He can wrap around an O-line or find the right gaps to get through them. At No. 25, this is a great spot for Tennessee to find a great prospect that will surely add to sack production. † †Atlanta Falcons No.26) Taven Bryan, DT, Florida Perhaps the biggest need for the Atlanta Falcons would be their lack of a pass rush. With some skill comparisons to that of NFL star J.J. Watt, Taven Bryan seems to be either directly or indirectly involved in almost every play. He knows how to land the sack, hold on to a tackle for loss, and has a good eye for the loose ball; he'll surely find an important role in this defense down the line. † New Orleans Saints No.27) Hayden Hurst, TE, South Carolina A huge target down the middle of the field, TE Hayden Hurst can make both the short 5-yard gain or earn a homerun play through yards after the catch. With an offense that's as flashy and fast as the Saints', a big and secure receiver for Drew Brees to rely on between the hash marks would add even more firepower to this offense. † Pittsburgh Steelers No.28) Rashaan Evans, LB, Alabama Alabama linebacker Rashaan Evans is a full motor player that only stops for the whistle. He was arguably the most versatile player on last year's championship team, and can become one of the best in the league if coached properly. Enter Pittsburgh, as the Steelers are known for shaping elite linebackers. This is an almost perfect spot as Evans is projected to land at the 28th selection. † Jacksonville Jaguars No.29) Jaire Alexander, CB, Louisville  Jacksonville's strongest side of the ball last season was by far their defense; primarily because of the turnover potential each time the ball was handed off. With cornerbacks like Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye in front of him, Jaire Alexander will be able to sharpen his ball hawking talents by learning from some of the best in the business. † Minnesota Vikings No.30) Connor Williams, OT, Texas The Minnesota Vikings are a playoff ready team and by default have little needs besides O-line improvement that they must focus on. Connor Williams out of Texas is known for his knack of blocking lanes and altogether cancelling out the pass rush. After making the biggest offseason trade for star quarterback Kirk Cousins, the team will want to give him all the protection they can possibly get. † New England Patriots No.31) Dallas Goedert, TE, South Dakota State As there are rumors swirling around Tom Brady, almost the same is being said about one of the NFL's best TEs in Rob Gronkowski. Sure, these are only rumors at the moment, but the Patriots' plans for the future will be put on display depending on how this year's draft goes for them. Dallas Goedert is an exceptional receiver and will definitely be a useful tool in New England's catching corps. † Philadelphia Eagles No.32) Sony Michel, RB, Georgia To close out the 2018 NFL Draft, the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles will most likely either trade back for more 2nd round capital, or select an offensive weapon to grow alongside Carson Wentz. Ultimately, analysts have them going with Georgia RB Sony Michel, who will surely give them another useful rotational back following LeGarrette Blount's departure.

sports,Men's Tennis Seeks 4th-Straight Big West Title,26-Apr-18,5:07 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/mens-tennis-seeks-4th-straight-big-west-title/,"The UCSB men's tennis team has had an outstanding season, winning 16 games, including its last eight, and sweeping its Big West opponents en route to the regular season conference title. None of that will matter, however, if the Gauchos fail to win their next two games in the Big West conference tournament this weekend. Set up from a nice serve. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus Because they are outside of the top 50 in the college rankings ""î in large part due to early season slip-ups against difficult opponents ""î the Gauchos will need to win the conference tournament in order to get the automatic bid for the NCAA tournament. By securing the first overall seed in the tournament after finishing 5-0 in conference play, Santa Barbara will have a bye until the semifinals on Friday. There, they will take on the winner of the UC Irvine-Hawaii match. On paper, Irvine seems to be the more likely opponent for UCSB. Despite only going 2-3 in conference play, they finished the season 15-11. In their matchup earlier this season, they defeated Hawaii 7-0. While Santa Barbara had the advantage of playing at home, where they finished the season 11-0, they were still able to dominate the Anteaters 7-0. In particular, the Gauchos leaned on their top three players: junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, sophomore Joseph Guillin and senior captain Simon Freund. In that particular match, all three players dominated, winning their matches in straight sets. If UCSB hopes to win the tournament, they will need those three to be on top of their game.
Guillin, a transfer from Florida, has been nothing short of spectacular in his first season as a Gaucho, earning a 19-2 dual match singles record. Freund has also been great, as he has won eight straight matches and earned a 15-5 mark in dual matches. Moreno de Alboran, ranked No. 76 in the country, has tallied a very solid 27-10 overall record and a 14-5 mark in dual matches. Being the only Big West player that has been ranked nationally, Moreno de Alboran will likely be invited to participate in the NCAA Singles Championships next month so long as he does not lose his ranking, giving him extra incentive to continue playing well in this tournament. Where Irvine gave the Gauchos some trouble, however, was at the lower courts, a place where Santa Barbara particularly struggled earlier in the season. On courts four and six, the Anteaters took UCSB to three sets, proving that they at least have the skillset to hang tight with them on those courts. Irvine is a talented team, and without the advantage of playing at home, the Gauchos will need to be on their A-game, especially since they will have had a day off already. If Hawaii beats Irvine, UCSB will be favored fairly heavily in that matchup. Despite only going 3-14 on the season, the Rainbow Warriors were able to eke out two conference victories, making them the fifth seed in the tournament. While they once again had the advantage of playing in front of a home crowd, UCSB was in charge of their regular season matchup with Hawaii from start to finish. In fact, Santa Barbara did not drop a single set during the entire match. If UCSB can advance to the championship game, they will most likely have a rematch with Cal Poly in what was a very top-heavy conference this year. Just days ago, the Gauchos went into SLO and blanked the Mustangs 7-0 to take the regular season title.
That being said, Cal Poly is an incredibly talented team, having gone 17-6 on the season and 4-1 in the conference. In their matchup, UCSB used the doubles point in order to nullify the home court advantage of Cal Poly. Led by the No. 85 duo in the country, Moreno de Alboran and junior Anders Holm, who eked out a win on court one 6-4, the Gauchos were then able to take that momentum into singles play, where they won every single match. That being said, Cal Poly is 17-6 for a reason, and their top three players all had excellent seasons.
Junior Josh Ortlip finished 14-4 on the season, and gave Moreno de Alboran a run for his money on court one. UCSB will have to keep up the way they've played during their current eight-game winning streak if they are to extend their season. This has the makings of a team that could be dangerous in the NCAA tournament. First, however, they must get there. Santa Barbara will play their semifinal match on Friday at 3 p.m. at Indian Wells. If they win that match, they will then play in the championship game on Sunday at 9 a.m.

The Gauchos are coming off one of their most impressive wins of the season against No. 9 UC Davis on Senior Day. They will be looking to carry over the strong defensive effort they showed in this game, in which they held the third-best offense in the league to only five points, as they move into the postseason. On the other side, the 49ers will aim to break out of their recent struggles as they have lost four of their last six games by an average margin of four goals. Their 11-13 overall, 2-3 conference record placed them close to last in the Big West to end the year; however, the postseason offers them a blank slate moving forward. Long Beach last played against No. 8 UC Irvine and lost by a score of 11-8. Both senior utility Virginia Smith and senior center Alexandra Massier tallied hat tricks in the contest but the 49ers could not hold off the red-hot Anteater offense. Massier leads the way for Long Beach State with 35 goals on the year while junior attacker Tori Morrissey has 10 assists on the year to lead the team. The teams have met twice this year with the 'Chos winning the first matchup in early February by five goals while the 49ers claimed the second matchup by one goal in March to start conference play. It will be crucial for the Gauchos to continue their defensive success in order get past the 49ers, starting with the play of sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder. The Santa Ana native is coming off a contest in which she had 14 saves. ""úThere was a moment in the last game where she scored a goal from the cage which does not happen very often,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay explained postgame. ""úShe stepped up and took a risk and that was definitely a turning point in that game for us. I think she played really well and the whole team felt the energy from that. I am looking forward to her continuing her high level of play.""ù Despite being one of the youngest teams in the conference, Santa Barbara has been able to find success against their top-ranked opponents behind the play of sophomore utility Sarah Snyder, junior utility Kate Pipkin and stud freshman attacker Mollie Simmons. ""úPip does a good job of being a playmaker,""ù Kay pointed out. ""úShe is very versatile and has a really high game IQ which is one of the reasons she can fill the role of the playmaker.""ù Snyder finished the regular season with 46 goals, which not only led the team but also ranked fourth in the Big West Conference. Pipkin had 39 goals and 33 assists on the year which gave her a total of 72 points on the year, which ranked fourth in the Big West Conference. ""úFor Sarah, I talked about her being an inspiring player in the past, and I think she is still doing a great job of that,""ù Kay stated. UCSB will look to continue to implement their patient play-style in the postseason as it worked extremely well in their last win against the Aggies. ""úI think allowing the game to develop is important,""ù Coach Kay highlighted. ""úSometimes there are teams that if they rush too much, there are more errors on their part which means the other team does not have to necessarily do anything to get those errors to occur. We have focused on that and this team has done a good job of maturing into that.""ù As the Gauchos approach postseason play, they will look to follow the mantra that has led them to their successful season thus far, as they look to bring home a Big West title. ""úWork hard, be resilient and trust the process,""ù Kay said. Santa Barbara will play Long Beach State at 12 p.m. this Friday, April 27, at the Anteater Aquatics Complex in Irvine. If they win their matchup with the 49ers, they will face No. 5 Hawaii on Saturday at 1 p.m.

sports,Snyder Sings and Scores: Sarah's Major Pregame Ritual,26-Apr-18,5:10 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-04-26/snyder-sings-and-scores-sarahs-major-pregame-ritual/,"Sarah Snyder puts up a strong defense. Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus For most athletes, a pregame routine consists of them listening to their favorite music, eating a healthy snack or going over plays that they want to run against their respective opponent. For Sarah Snyder, sophomore utility of the UCSB women's water polo team, a pregame routine involves performing the national anthem before the game, an honor that most players usually only participate in by watching from the sidelines. Snyder is currently having her best offensive season as a Gaucho as she has tallied 46 goals on the year, which ranks fourth in the Big West Conference. She is also considered one of the leaders of the team as she brings a gritty attitude and carries a lot of responsibility on the team. With such a hectic schedule consisting of practices, classes, traveling and studying, it is almost impossible to not feel stressed with so many things going on. However, for Snyder, singing has allowed her to de-stress ever since her childhood. ""úI was four when I started singing, and my mom kind of forced me into choir,""ù she said. ""úIt started off as a cool thing where I had friends, and it was something aside from sports that I could do. I love singing because it is a way to add positivity to my life.""ù Although it may seem that singing was always a positive experience for Snyder, this was not always the case. When she was seven years old, she was told to sing the national anthem at a local swim meet, but in the middle of the song, she forgot some of the words, which led to a very traumatic experience. ""úI was scarred,""ù she said. ""úI did not sing for two more years, but I finally had the courage to do it again two years later.""ù It would be reasonable to imagine that she would have had to sacrifice some of her time singing to primarily focus on her water polo career, but that could not be further from the truth. ""úBeing a student athlete is definitely time consuming, so I don't really have much time for other things, but I sing around the house and the pool a lot,""ù Snyder explained. ""úI don't really sacrifice much.""ù The idea of Snyder singing the national anthem before games first came about when Head Coach Serela Kay asked her to sing the piece on Senior Day of the 2017 season.
With the whole team on board with the decision, Snyder decided that she would give it a shot despite being extremely nervous that she would make a mistake. ""úMy nerves are already up before games and my adrenaline is going,""ù Snyder explained. ""úMy heart is racing and adding singing to that is very difficult. I was like, I got to do it for the seniors and then it just turned into something after that.""ù When asked whether she had to audition for Coach Kay, Snyder chuckled and explained how she was asked to perform. She would also go on to advocate for freshman Sami Stebbins joining her in the near future. ""úSami Stebbins is pretty good,""ù she explained. ""úShe is really good actually. When I leave, she will probably carry the torch.""ù For Snyder, there will never be any singing competitions between her and her teammates because they all have talented voices. Instead, her idea is that the best singers on the team should sing the national anthem together rather than one person having the spotlight. ""úNo competitions,""ù Snyder explained. ""úI think Sami has a great voice. I would love for her to sing with me. Pip also has a great voice and can play the guitar. Emily can sing also. We should do it all together but definitely no competition.""ù Despite the stress that comes with singing before games, Snyder has been able to limit it through a mantra that she has recently started to follow profusely. ""úSinging probably makes me more tense before games, but a little mantra that I have been sticking with is that failure doesn't exist and carries over into every aspect in my life,""ù Snyder said. ""úIf you can't fail, you can't succeed, and the least I can do is try.""ù When performing in front of her teammates, Snyder has mixed emotions, especially since she is singing in front of the home crowd as well. ""úIt's nerve-wracking but comfortable, I'd say,""ù Snyder said. ""úI know they are all supportive even if I forget the words to the national anthem. Nobody will be upset or anything, so I feel very supported. It helps having a very close-knit team so everybody is always there for each other.""ù With the support of her teammates and the home crowd, it makes performing a lot easier as she explains that the applause quells her nerves and strengthens her bond with her teammates. She often finds herself listening to alternative rock in her free time, as it sets her into a positive mood as she goes through her hectic schedule. ""úI love so much music,""ù Snyder said. ""úI actually started with classic rock because my dad used to play it all the time. My favorite artists are probably bands nobody has ever heard of. I like Arctic Monkeys and Parachute in particular. When songs like ""úMore Than A Feeling""ù by Boston come on, I am definitely blasting it in my car.""ù Despite being such a talented singer, her primary focus is on water polo and her education, as well as finding the perfect balance between the two. ""úAs of right now, water polo and school is the most important thing right now,""ù Snyder said. ""úIf I could become a pop star, that would be awesome, but it is not in the cards right now. Or probably ever. It will probably just be my hidden talent, just something fun to do.""ù With the Big West Tournament coming up this weekend, Snyder will look to continue to bring this positive mindset that she has acquired through singing to the team as they look to make some noise in the tournament and win their second Big West Title in the last three years. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the April 26th, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The UCSB Gauchos (20-18-1) will play the Cal State University, Bakersfield Roadrunners (16-26) on Tuesday, May 1 as part of the first of a two-game series which will be completed midway through the month. The Gauchos suffered a tough extra innings loss in the final game of their series against UC Riverside this past Sunday, falling 14-10. The game lasted until the eleventh inning when UCR exploded for four runs and was able to shut down UCSB to avoid the series sweep. Only six runs were batted in with junior Thomas Rowan and freshman Drew Williams tying for the team lead with two RBIs a piece. Jack Dashwood would make the start for the Gauchos but only went 1.2 innings with three earned runs. Junior Alex Patterson took over for Luke Andrews in the top of the fourth and made the best outing for the team pitching 3.1 innings with one hit allowed. Seven different Gaucho pitchers would appear in the game each allowing 1+ earned run. Freshman Chris Troye would pitch the Gauchos from the ninth inning until the top of the eleventh before giving up a single. Sophomore Ben Brecht replaced Troye and gave up a three-run home run to Highlander Anthony Lepre. With the first runner scored being Troye's responsibility, the freshman would get tagged with the loss. CSU Bakersfield's last series was on a road trip to Washington to play Seattle University where the team lost 4-10. The Redhawks victory in the final match was their second consecutive and gave the team the series win. The Roadrunners struggled to match the Redhawks offensive success and starter Nick Meservey kept Bakersfield scoreless his entire outing. Junior Ryan Koch, who leads the team in RBIs on the year, went 0-4 in the game. Junior Noah Barba and freshman Daniel Carrizosa stayed hot in the series as each got a hit and RBI in the game. Hits, runs, and batting average team leader Andrew Penner was another Roadrunner with an RBI. The .341 average hitter has been a consistent and dangerous offensive threat for the Roadrunners and will be a problem for the Gauchos' pitching rotation. Despite making a huge impact early on in the Riverside series, sophomore Tommy Jew and junior Clay Fisher quieted down a bit in their final game gathering a combined three hits. The three hit total is an average outcome compared to Fisher's perfect day at the plate the day before and Jew's four hit two RBI performance the day before that. The dynamic duo have been the Gauchos' top two offensive producers on the season with the two occupying the top places in the major offensive categories. Williams has been getting hot as of late as the freshman has shown an ability to get key hits for his team that result in runs on the board. The Roadrunner pitching staff which struggled much like the Gauchos' against Riverside will be looking to bounce back against Fisher, Jew, and the others. The Gauchos are still .500 in the Big West Conference, having a record of six wins and six losses. The record is enough to put them at fourth in the conference and will be a good preview game as CSU Bakersfield will be joining the Gauchos in the Conference in 2022.

sports,Unwavering Unity: A Look Inside The UCSB Women's Rugby Team,1-May-18,4:42 PM,['Kendra Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-01/unwavering-unity-a-look-inside-the-ucsb-womens-rugby-team/," Intensity. Determination. Unity. These are just a few words that sum up the UCSB women's rugby team. While rugby is a sport that is widely popular, many don't know that we have an incredible women's team on campus. I got to sit down with a few of the ladies from the team as we discussed their motto of unity, how playing such an intense sport brings meaning to their lives, and how lacking sufficient school funding makes them rise above the rest. Going just 2-4 in the regular season last year, the team found solace in their new head coach Zac Winter this season, who helped implement new practices and work hard to turn the team around. He certainly did his job well as the rugby team was nothing short of amazing this year, beating nearly every team in their way. Loaded with passion and exuding confidence, you'd be hard pressed to find another sport with athletes as driven as those on the UCSB women's rugby team. With six seniors on the roster set to graduate, it was only appropriate that the team put on such a dominant performance in the regular season. Ending second in the league with an 8-3 record, the Gauchos were not able to carry that magic into the postseason as they lost to opponent Chico to end their journey to the championship. The team is not discouraged though, as they all mentioned that there is nowhere else for them to go but up. Rugby is a sport that requires precision, aggression, and players who aren't afraid to get dirty or risk injury. ""úWe do get crazy injuries, and if anything, we're proud of them,""ù Sophomore treasurer Kayla Aurelio Hughes cleared up, ""úBut there is so much more to our team and our story than just concussions and broken thumbs.""ù The team admitted that while the susceptibility to injuries is sometimes imminent, it makes the playing of the sport that much more enjoyable. No matter what happens to a teammate on the field, there is always another teammate right behind, ready to help with whatever the other needs ""ì both on and off the field. Junior Jasmine Guevara pointed out that rugby has played a huge role in her life and her social circle: ""úWhen I first got to UCSB, knowing how shy I am, I honestly thought I wasn't going to make many friends if not any. And here I am two and half years later, loving the sport and having more friends than I could have ever asked for, friends I know I can count on and off the field.""ù Unity is something the ladies make clear is the basis in all that they do, not leaving anyone behind. In a world full of inequality, the morale of the Gauchos women's rugby team embeds the notion that their team is no place for any hate or opposition ""ì unity and acceptance is all they know. Sophomore Maria Tejada gushed about the team's motto of unity when asked about how it defines the team. She explained that ""úunity is the theme of our team for so many reasons. We win games because of unity, we work hard to come back from injuries because of unity, and we are extremely accepting because we have big hearts and because of unity.""ù While the team's unity and standout aggressive play is not to be overlooked, often times they find themselves dedicating a lot of time to off-the-field activities as well. Funding is something UCSB women's rugby works hard to keep steady, as they don't receive as much school funding as several other teams on campus. ""úWhile we do get some funding from Rec Sports to help pay for coaching, we mainly rely on dues from players and fundraising,""ù senior Social Chair Haley Pedersen revealed, ""úIt's just an additional stress that gets in the way of our team growing. Fundraising can be hard because all clubs are trying to do the same fundraisers and when it comes to getting donations, there are a lot of people who do not support women playing rugby.""ù Despite the need to be assertive in their fundraising practices, the team makes sure not to let money concerns stop them from playing the sport they love. Senior Fundraising Chair Miranda Nillo optimistically noted that ""úsince [The rugby team is] pretty much autonomous, it puts a lot of pressure on team leaders as far as what we decide to spend our money on. However, even though we're not primarily school funded, we do know that the girls who do want to play rugby are willing to pay for it and are here for a reason! We're all so passionate about rugby!""ù The heart of the Gauchos' women's rugby team is palpable, and their fortitude is unmatched. The cohesiveness of the group as a unit, translates through their superior play both on and off the field in all that they do. Women's rugby not only participates in various fundraisers for their own team dealings, but they also consistently offer their time and effort to various charity events, giving back even whenever they can. The team is a well-oiled machine, with each member playing a pivotal part in keeping their success afloat. Hughes admired her team's heart and ability to stay strong no matter what. She made sure to note that, ""úthe girls keep the program running. I am so grateful to play with a group of driven, motivated women who don't let anything get in their way.""ù The Gaucho's women's rugby team proves that there is insurmountable strength in numbers, by displaying toughness through their unwavering team unity and proving that division is an unwelcome team weakness. Working together as a supportive unit, aids the team in accomplishing their goals together on the field and throughout their college career. Balancing school, sports, and jobs, these are some of the most talented women at Santa Barbara that you'll ever meet. No team, funding issues, or opposition can stop the UCSB women's rugby team ""ì they are determined not to let anything get in their way.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Big news in recent weeks has occurred for the UCSB men's basketball program as Head Coach Joe Pasternack has reeled in another top transfer. This time it's Ar'mond Davis from the University of Alabama, who will be immediately eligible as a grad transfer. We've already seen the value of transfers for the Gauchos with this past season's talents of Leland King II and Marcus Jackson, both essential pieces to the Gauchos' bounce-back season.
UCSB is facing the biggest turnover of the top Big West teams, losing four of their top five scorers to graduation, while UC Irvine, Fullerton and UC Davis are all returning the majority of their top options. The incoming freshmen recruits and the transfers will need to step up to the plate and support leading scorer and First Team All Big West guard Max Heidegger and the returning Gauchos if UCSB wants to continue building on Pasternack's successful first season at the helm. Let's preview the newcomers and what their contributions could mean for the Gauchos' next season. THE FRESHMEN Amadou Sow
The 6-foot-9 forward from Mali gives the Gauchos a presence down low as rebounding is his biggest strength. He's got the size to finish plays on both sides of the court with his ability to block shots and finish baskets. Sow played for the prestigious Oakland Soldiers AAU squad, playing against top players around the country and holding his own. The physical big man should make an immediate impact for the Gauchos and could be a big part of the rotation. Expect him and senior Ami Lakoju to hold the paint down for the Gauchos. With USCB a bit thinner on big men next year, it is possible for Sow to play big minutes. S√©kou Tour√©
The 6 foot 5 wing has the potential to fill the stat sheet for the Gauchos as he has great rebounding and defensive skills. He'll need to improve his three-point shooting as that wasn't really part of his game in his time with the Oakland Soldiers. Pasternack should try to develop that part of his game, and he has been quoted as saying he believes Tour√©, ""úby his freshman year, he will be a knockdown three-point shooter.""ùIt will be exciting to see if he can make that leap this summer and give the Gauchos another added threat from deep. Jay Nagle
Nagle's game is one of the most intriguing because he can give the Gauchos a new dynamic as a solid role player from the beginning. He's 6-foot-8, shoots threes at a tremendous clip of 44 percent and he's shot nearly 400 in his junior and senior years alone. If he can play some defense, his offensive value should be evident from the get-go. UCSB was 220th in three-pointers attempted last year, and while they shot a great percentage, they did not have a guy who could just let it go at a high volume with a quick release besides Heidegger. When Heidegger and Nagle share the court, the defense will be stretched out tremendously by their gravity, so I can see Nagle making an instant impact with his one elite skill of shooting the long ball. THE TRANSFERS Ar'mond Davis
Davis is the newest of the newcomers to the Gauchos for next season. The 6-foot-6 guard will be a grad transfer and will be immediately eligible next season. He's starred at Southern Idaho and was rated the No.6 Junior College player in the country after his first two years there. Since then he transferred to Alabama, where he played pretty well, averaging six points per game in 13 minutes per game. He got injured before the start of this season and had to sit out, but if he can recover well, he should be a key contributor for UCSB. While he was inefficient in his shooting in his lone season at Alabama, his shot has good arc to it and a quick release, and he was far more efficient at Southern Idaho shooting 45 percent from the field. Davis adds another wing to what should be a position of strength for the Gauchos' next season. Devearl Ramsey
Ramsey is a 5-foot-10 guard who transferred from the University of Nevada in 2017. He's been on campus for a year already, so he should be used to playing with the team. He was a top recruit out of high school and shouldn't be surprised to start for the Gauchos, especially if Coach Pasternack favors Heidegger in the off-ball guard role he often played next to Gabe Vincent last year. He should replace some of the Gauchos' playmaking needs even if he does come off the bench. The Gauchos are losing over 10 assists per game from the graduating seniors, and Ramsey's game favors getting his teammates the ball, even reaching nine assists in a single game at Nevada. One other source of optimism for Ramsey is the success of former Nevada teammate King last year. If Ramsey can make half as much of an impact as King did last year, then the Gauchos should be very happy. The Wrap-Up The Gauchos may look different, but don't count them out for a similarly strong showing in Pasternack's second year at the helm. Heidegger returns as one of the best gunners in college basketball and should be a strong favorite to win Big West player of the year after he was robbed of the award this time around. While key contributors like King and Vincent are gone, Pasternack has rebuilt this team with a focus on athletic swingmen. Expect the Gauchos to have a quick, switchy defense and to be more perimeter-focused next year. We know guys like Heidegger, Nagle and the other newcomers in the backcourt can hit shots from outside, but the key for the Gauchos to reach a high ceiling could be their frontline headlined by the freshman Sow and senior Lakoju. If they can rebound well and protect the rim, Pasternack will have a plethora of offensive talent coming back the other end. † A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 3rd, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Ready For More: DeWeese's UCSB Journey Has Yet To Peak,2-May-18,12:00 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ready-for-more-deweeses-ucsb-journey-has-yet-to-peak/,"Randy DeWeese sets the ball to his outside hitter. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus From a family whose volleyball aspirations brought them to compete at the collegiate level comes the next generation to continue that legacy. It took Randy DeWeese plenty of hard work and determination during his journey into the NCAA. Now a key part of the No. 12 team in the nation, DeWeese's elite showings every game night are a testament to his skill as much as a prime example of why the Gauchos will be in good hands at the setter position for years to come. DeWeese is only a sophomore here at UCSB, but with already-impressive stats of a team-high 637 assists and a 7.41 assists-per-set ratio, you might figure him for a seasoned vet at first. Those rankings were also the sixth-best mark in the Big West Conference. As the starting setter for the Gauchos men's volleyball team, he is a great role model of how every practice, gym session and game is just another opportunity to improve daily. Although his best volleyball moments are still sure to come, it's equally fascinating to understand his journey of how he became one of the best setters in the nation for his age. ""úMy mom played at the U of A, my uncle at Stanford and the junior national team. So I knew I had it in me,""ù DeWeese said. ""úI just had to put in the work and grind it out. That way I was able to figure it all out before I got to college.""ù Growing up in NorCal's Sacramento area, volleyball had always played a big part in his life. When considering his family's direct ties to the sport, he really wanted to continue in their footsteps and excel at the same elite level, and that's exactly what he did. Early on, DeWeese received much praise in his time playing club volleyball for Northern California Volleyball Club (NCVC). He earned various accolades for his performances all around the court, such as a spot on the U.S. Junior National Training Team and a feature in Volleyball Magazine's ""úFab 50.""ù Still, it became very clear that his strongest ability was that of his playmaking expertise at the setter position. Soon enough, that tough process of going from club to college began and he started reaching out to some of the best programs in the nation. In the beginning, DeWeese was no stranger to rejection as out-of-state responses didn't go as planned. Luckily, it was his home state of California who came to the rescue as some of the Big West's head coaches started to take notice of his true playmaking potential. ""úI started looking pretty early on, around my sophomore year, and that's when I first found Santa Barbara,""ù DeWeese said. ""úI also visited UCI and UCLA, but I just didn't feel it""¶UCSB was just so perfect.""ù Just like most other collegiate athletes, this transition to the next level took a toll on DeWeese. Whether it was intense practice sessions or putting in that extra hour in the gym, DeWeese points out that each day is a positional battle for all members of the team. ""úPlaying for Santa Barbara was really eye-opening; it showed me just how hard I had to work,""ù DeWeese said. ""úEven if the talent is there, you really have to apply yourself, you have to try harder every day. That way you get to where you want to be and achieve whatever you want.""ù DeWeese also points out that everyone on the roster wants to start and that even some of his closest friends are the teammates whom he competes against. Nevertheless, coaches will only start those who are willing to put in the time and effort to deserve that starting position. Following an earlier than expected exit from this recent postseason, the Gauchos finished the year with an 11-13 overall record and in fifth place in the Big West Conference standings. Despite that, fans must also realize that No. 12 UCSB was No. 15 in NCAA rankings earlier in the year, showing that they did improve throughout the year. Also, the Big West is perhaps the most competitive league since there are a total of four top-10 programs who also participate. Therefore, this was much more than a growing season, it was a preview of just how great UCSB can become over these next few years. Earlier this season, Santa Barbara claimed upset wins against No. 3 UC Irvine, No. 6 BYU, No. 8 CSUN and No. 10 Ball State. ""úConsidering we were one of the younger teams in the league, this season went fairly successful. We took a few games against some highly ranked opponents and that caught a lot of people off guard. Just showing what we were capable of was a huge step for us, and we're going to be that same kind of team next year,""ù DeWeese said. ""úI think we're not far behind at all ""¶ We are young, but a big goal for us would be breaking into the top 10 and maintaining that throughout the year.""ù Considering only a quarter of the total team is upperclassmen, UCSB certainly will look to improve their play. Of those four upperclassmen, only one is a senior. Therefore, practically the same familiar squad will be lining up for the Gauchos next year, and UCSB's star setter has high hopes for the next step of expected progression during this offseason. ""úThe way our returning group is progressing has been really fast and we're learning how to truly play together,""ù DeWeese said. ""úAnd other teams will have to change their dynamic to fit with new players, whereas our starting lineup looks to stay the same next year. So it's nice knowing that we'll have that chemistry advantage in next season's league.""ù As true with any team of any sport, a change in both players and personnel can make or break a team. Luckily for UCSB, this returning group of now experienced players will be able to function together at a higher level. However, the fact still remains that the Gauchos compete in the Big West, one of the most competitive volleyball conferences in the entire nation.† Including UCSB, five of the total six league teams in the Big West have been ranked all year long within the top-15 programs in NCAA poll rankings. ""úI think a good goal for us would be staying in the top 10 and maintaining it through the whole year,""ù said DeWeese when asked about his expectations for the team next season. ""úWhen it comes to conference play, taking a third seed or better would be ideal""¶then winning in the first round of the Big West tournament.""ù Upon first thought, DeWeese's goal seems very challenging. However, considering UCSB has beaten half of the 12 different teams they played in the top 15 this season, it seems like a very possible feat. With added context, No. 12 UCSB was not ranked within the top 15 at all in the beginning of the year; however, at one point this season they went as high as the 11th-best program in the nation. All in all, DeWeese will continue to play a huge part in the game plans of UCSB men's volleyball, and he only earned his role because of all the years he spent developing his craft. In essentially any competitive scenario, a team is only as good as its leader. In volleyball, players look to their setter for both playmaking production and quality control. Santa Barbara's program is lucky to have a positional leader like DeWeese, and he proves that every game night when he leaves it all out on the court. † A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 3rd, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Season In Review: 2017-2018 Women's Water Polo,2-May-18,11:38 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/season-in-review-2017-2018-womens-water-polo/,"Attacker Shannon Moran looks for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The No. 16 ranked UCSB women's water polo team finished the season with an overall record of 16-13 overall, 2-3 in conference play and fourth place in the Big West Standings. Despite an up-and-down season, Santa Barbara was able to grow and gain confidence throughout the year against top-ranked opponents such as UC Davis and Hawaii. Although UCSB had the youngest roster in the Big West this year, the ""òChos were able to find success throughout the season with the help of freshman attacker Mollie Simmons, sophomore utility Sarah Snyder and junior utility Kate Pipkin. Snyder finished the season with 49 goals on the year, which was just five goals shy of CSUN's senior Madeleine Sanchez who had 54 goals. This marks the most goals Snyder has had in a season as she broke her previous record of 35 goals from her freshman campaign. ""úShe has come a long way,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay said. ""úLast year she had big shoes to fill as a starting center as a freshman. This year she has become more of a leader in and out of the pool, which has really benefited the team""ù Simmons was all over the pool this year as she ranked in the top five of the conference in steals. With a team-leading 42 steals on the year, she was able to have an impact defensively despite having the primary responsibility of initiating the offense in the front court. ""úShe won 89/100 sprints which is incredible,""ù Kay explained. ""úShe made an impact right away and led the team in steals as well. She did a great job as a freshman and I look forward to seeing what she does in the future.""ù Pipkin had her most efficient season in her Gaucho career as she found the back of the net 44 times, assisted on 35 Santa Barbara goals and ranked among the top three in overall points on the year. In order for UCSB to improve next season, it will be crucial for Pipkin, Snyder and Simmons to continue to elevate their game and learn from their past experiences from this season. Sophomore goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder also had a tremendous year as she had 171 saves on the season with a save percentage of 59. As the anchor of the Gauchos' defense, Snyder often frustrated opponents by preventing potential goals from finding the back of the net with the help of her quick reflexes. One highlight of the year was in a game vs UC Davis when Snyder threw the ball over Davis' keeper and into the Aggies' goal from her own goal. ""úGoalkeepers are the most important position in polo in my opinion,""ù Kay stated. ""úShe did a good job and the future is definitely bright. With two years under her belt, I expect her to really rise to the occasion.""ù With everyone returning except senior defender Annie Mortimer, Santa Barbara will look to build on the chemistry they have already developed this year and perfect their craft for next season. ""úI expect us to pick up right where we left off,""ù Kay explained. ""úI think it is important that we reflect during this offseason on the things we did well and improve on them. At this point, I don't think we need to change anything dramatically but instead just need to get better at what we are doing.""ù UCSB will look to develop over this offseason as they aim to climb to the top of the Big West next season with a more experienced group that will use this past season as motivation to elevate their level of play.

sports,"UCSB Seeking To Gain Conference Edge, Hosts CSUN",2-May-18,11:39 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-02/ucsb-seeking-to-gain-conference-edge-hosts-csun/,"Running to first after making contact with the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus With a .500 record through conference play thus far, the UCSB baseball team is in need of a few more Big West wins if it really hopes to come out with the crown this season. The Gauchos, coming off a solid 9-5 victory at Cal State Bakersfield this past Tuesday, currently stand at 21-18-1 overall and 6-6 in the Big West conference. This week, they welcome Cal State Northridge, who has struggled this year, posting a 19-24 overall mark and a 7-8 conference record. CSUN, just 8-13 on the road, is coming off a big series win against Hawai'I, who is currently third in the Big West standings. Before that, the Matadors had lost five of their last six conference games being swept by UC Irvine and dropping two of three to last-place Long Beach State. On the other side, UCSB picked up a big series win against UCR at home last weekend but failed to pull off a sweep which would have put them in a much better place heading down the stretch. The Gauchos can correct that with a sweep, or at the very least, a series win over CSUN. Currently in fourth place, Santa Barbara has 12 games remaining against conference opponents, nine of which will be against teams currently ranked lower than them in the standings, including Cal State Northridge. Needing wins, UCSB must rely on some of its key components in order to get the job done this weekend against CSUN. Having an unusually down year, sophomore infielder Armani Smith has struggled at the plate. The sophomore is barely batting above .200 on the season. However, in the last five games, Smith has gone 6-16 (.375) at the plate along with eight RBIs. He also hit a three-run big fly in Tuesday's win against CSUB, his fifth homer of the season. If Smith's big bat is back in action in the lineup, then UCSB truly has a solid starting nine. Sophomore centerfielder Tommy Jew has also been a great bat in the Santa Barbara lineup, currently slashing .294/.382/.451 on the season. Last week, Jew received Big West Conference Field Player of the Week after leading the Gauchos to a series win over UC Riverside last weekend. The sophomore went 9-15 (.600) with seven RBIs, scoring six runs while also totaling four extra-base hits including his third home run of the season. One thing UCSB will need to be cognizant of, however, is their pitching, as it allowed 24 runs against UCR and another five against CSUB. Sophomore Chris Lincoln (2.19 ERA, 2-2) and senior Stevie Ledesma (2.55 ERA, 5-2) have the second and fourth-best ERA marks in the conference respectively. As a team, the pitching staff has a combined 4.10 ERA, and they will have their work cut out for them facing CSUN with their team batting average of .281, the third-best mark in the conference. In fact, the Matadors also have the third best on-base percentage (.364) and even the best slugging percentage (.459) in the conference. A big part of that is because the Matadors have arguably the best long-ball hitter in the Big West in senior Albee Weiss. The outfielder and catcher currently has 15 home runs on the season, a mark that is not only far and away the best mark in the conference but also sits at eighth nationally. Weiss also has 48 RBIs, the top mark in the Big West. CSUN also has the conference's most efficient hitter as redshirt junior utility Trevor Casanova currently boasts a .380 batting average. Casanova also has 27 RBIs on the year. As a team, Cal State Northridge has three athletes batting above .300 on the year. While the whole series will be intriguing, seeing how UCSB pitchers adjust to facing a strong offensive team will be a real treat. To be fair, however, CSUN has batted .257 in conference play, a mark that has them sitting seventh in the conference, so something will have to give. For UCSB, this series is important because they have another chance to really step on the throat of a team that is a bit weaker than the rest in this conference. With CSUF sitting with a 9-3 Big West mark, Santa Barbara cannot afford to take many more losses in this conference season. Santa Barbara hosts Cal State Northridge for a three-game set beginning at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 4, at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

sports,Gauchos Lose to CSUN Friday 6-4,5-May-18,8:33 PM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-05/82921/,"Chris Lincoln winds up to pitch. Nicolas Eitelbach / Daily Nexus † The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos (21-19-1) could not come back against the California State University, Northridge Matadors (20-24) after giving up a two-run lead in the top of the fifth allowing the Matadors to take the first win of the series, 6-4. Sophomore Tommy Jew started off the scoring for the Gauchos with a first inning homer down the right field line. The one run lead was short lived and the Matadors were able to tie the game an inning later with a homer of their own from senior Kevin Riley for his seventh longball of the season. The Gauchos used two men on base in the bottom of the second to earn the team a 3-1 lead. Junior Michael McAdoo and freshman Drew Williams advanced to third and second on a throwing error by the Matador starting pitcher. Junior Sam Cohen sent a single to right field to bring Williams home while a sacrifice fly from freshman Jason Willow would score McAdoo for his 28th run of the year. Freshman Brandon Bohning opened the third inning with an extra-base hit and junior Trevor Casanova would hit a sacrifice fly to bring Bohning home after he advanced to third during the previous at-bat. Casanova earned his 28th RBI of the season and brought his team to within one run of UCSB. Sophomore Chris Lincoln started the game for the Gauchos and would only go as far as the fourth inning. With four hits allowed and two earned runs the right handed pitcher, did as well as he could in minimizing the damage from a couple of mistakes on the mound. The sub-five inning start is Lincoln's first since a Mar. 17 appearance against Sacramento State. The Matadors scored a pair of runs in the fifth and sixth innings to gain and pad their lead. Casanova came through for his team again and more specifically his teammate Bohning who would cross the plate again on his single to the right side. Senior Nolan Bumstead would single in Casanova in his at-bat before UCSB was able to get out of the inning down a run, 4-3. Senior Alvaro Rubalcaba singled to right center to score senior Riley Conlan before Bohning would get an RBI of his own to score Rubalcaba, and put the tally at 6-3. Junior Thomas Rowan would crush a ball over the right field fence in the bottom of the seventh inning for his third homer of the season. The longball put UCSB behind by two, but the deficit was too much to overcome and were not able to put any further damage on the CSUN starter. Junior Walker Armstrong went the distance against the Gauchos, giving up four hits and three earned runs over nine innings pitched. The complete game is the right handers second of the season and the marathon effort was good enough to earn him his second win on the year. Despite getting into trouble early on in the game, Armstrong was extremely successful in being able to bear down and prevent UCSB from mounting enough momentum to try to make an attempt to take back the lead after giving it up. The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos will play the Cal State University, Northridge Matadors† on Saturday, May 5 at 2 p.m. at Caesar Uyesaka stadium.

sports,Gauchos Drop First Two Games Against Heavy Hitting Highlanders,6-May-18,5:40 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-drop-first-two-games-against-heavy-hitting-highlanders/,"Melanie Menor catches the ball before the LBSU hitter gets a chance to get to second base. Nicole Wallace/Daily Nexus Swept in their weekly doubleheader for the third time in conference play""îthis time by UC Riverside""îthe UCSB softball team continue to dig themselves into a deep hole as they now place last in Big West rankings. Santa Barbara holds the worst record in conference coming in at 5-12, a win average that fails to even reach .300. Its seasonal record suffers accordingly at 18-32, and its the only team in Big West who has not seen at least 20 wins. UC Riverside sits well above SB in the number three spot of Big West with an almost-winning record of 8-9. Their overall record towers over the Gauchos' at 31-20. Lots of cleats stomped on home plate this Saturday; the high-scoring games racked a total of 36 runs between the two teams. Santa Barbara was on the wrong end, unfortunately, losing 13-11 in the first game and 9-3 in the second. This scoring mania, however, seems to be an unfortunate recurring pattern for UCSB. So far, in five of their twelve losses the Gauchos have allowed their competitor nine or more runs. As well as being high-scoring, SB's games lately also have been high in errors. Taking into consideration the series against Cal State Northridge last week, SB has made 14 errors in the past five games, seven of them being solely from this Saturday's double header. In the most recent face-off of this weekend, the Gauchos trailed Riverside 4-0 by just the second inning. Pitchers Veronika Gulvin and Lena Mayer, backed by their own Gaucho defense, were unable to keep Riverside baserunners off the field throughout the game, allowing their opponent to score in four of the six innings they batted. UC Riverside's Hannah Rodriguez pounced on each opportunity she got at the plate. Going 3 for 4 in the second game, the junior shortstop singled three times consequently producing three runs for her team. Rodriguez's predecessor in the lineup Jenna Curtan similarly maximized her own time on offense. The centerfielder's bat threatened Gaucho defense twice in her four turns at the plate with a double and a triple. UCR's tenacity at the plate remained stable through both games, a quality that seems to consistently evade Santa Barbara. While UCSB practically matched UCR in hits, its inability to bring baserunners home brings a pivotal downfall to the team's success. The first game of the day, however, illuminated a rarely-seen side of this lackluster offense. The Gauchos drove in 11 runs, their highest scoring win since facing Fordham way back in February. UCSB began and ended the game with home runs compliments of freshman and senior duo Maci Fines and Samantha Lujan. Lujan, who DP'd for the day, homered deep into left field with bases loaded in the sixth, setting up a potentially great comeback story as her team trailed then by only one run. Not only did the hit break her five-game dry streak, but it was also her first home run of the season. Fines matched Lujan's 3 for 4 performance for the day in both the first and second games of the day. The shortstop has had an unbelievable offensive debut in her first Big West series. She holds an incredible .400 batting average, far surpassing her teammates, and has 22 hits in just the 17 conference games so far. By itself, the Gauchos offense should have been enough to secure a win for the team. So where, then, did they go wrong? By the second inning, SB lost their 4-0 lead as the UCR offense pounced on the momentum put forth by their competitor and scored a returning seven runs. The teams remained arm in arm throughout the game: as one side scored, the other matched it. Lasting almost three hours, the lagging game took one final toll on the team in the last inning. An error allowed the Highlanders one last run to which the Gauchos were not able to respond to in their at-bats. Santa Barbara faces UC Riverside one more time on Sunday, May 6 at 1pm at Amy S. Harrison Field for a final shot at preventing a sweep on the weekend.

sports,Gauchos Roll Over Matadors Thanks to Dominant Pitching Display,6-May-18,5:10 AM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-06/gauchos-roll-over-matadors-thanks-to-dominant-pitching-display/,"Steven Ledesma pitches. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus In a dominant outing, UCSB (22-19-1) senior Stevie Ledesma pitched his first complete game shutout of the year, stifling the bats of the California State University, Northridge Matadors (20-24) while getting a huge amount of run support in a 12-0 win. CSUN now sits in fifth place just one game ahead of the sixth place Gauchos in the Big West after the loss, while UCSB is trying to make a late push to create some distance between themselves and the lower half of the standings. The Gauchos were able to tee off junior Matador starter Isaiah Nunez early on in the game, as sophomore Tommy Jew †singled and scored junior Clay Fisher to start off the game. Jew made his way around to third base after junior Thomas Rowan's at bat and was able to cross the plate after a throwing error to first from the shortstop. At the end of the first inning the Gauchos were up 2-0. The overall offensive explosion from UCSB was highlighted by three-run performances in the second, fifth, and eighth innings. A single from sophomore Armani Smith was able to move freshman Marcos Castanon to second base for freshman Andrew Martinez's at-bat partially through the second inning. The designated hitter knocked a three-run blast to score Smith and Castanon, allowing Martinez to join a three player tie for the team season lead with five home runs. Junior Michael McAdoo piled onto the six-run lead in the fifth inning, hitting his own three-run home run to straightaway centerfield off of CSUN freshman Wesley Moore. A walk from junior Thomas Rowan and a center field single from Cole Mueller put them on first and second and the three RBIs for McAdoo was his second time this season. The lead increased to nine runs at the end of five innings. The final three-run inning for UCSB came in the eighth, with Castanon beginning the inning with a single to left center field. Smith came up to the plate a couple of batters later and hit a fly ball over the Matador center fielder's head, who played a bad route to the ball. Castanon and freshman Jason Willow, who was hit by a pitch, would come around to score on Smith's double to make the grand total 12-0. Ledesma was outstanding in his start for the Gauchos giving up six hits and getting seven strikeouts for the game's duration. The 6-2 record for the starter is the best in the pitching rotation for UCSB, and tied for fourth in the Big West, and he has now picked up the victory in three consecutive starts. In a postgame interview, Ledesma commented on his successful day praising his defense saying, ""úIf you're getting strikes and guys are making plays behind you that makes throwing strikes so much easier because you don't have to worry about balls in the holes that they're not making plays on. Them making plays makes my job a lot more easier.""ù The complete game effort was Ledesma's sixth quality start of the season as the pitcher has rarely failed to put in six full innings of work this year. The quantity of innings he has thrown is matched by the quality of his pitching as well, as Ledesma currently sits in second place in the conference in ERA with a stellar 2.16. The impressive performance from the senior was just his latest in a recent run that has seen him rise up in the ranks and look to be an effective tool for UCSB as they inch closer to the NCAA tournament. UCSB Head Coach Andrew Checketts message to his team remains one of quiet persistence explaining, ""úFor this particular group we've handled failure better than we've handled success ""¶ it'll be another battle for us tomorrow and I'm looking forward to see their response. I want to see some intent with want they do and some maturity with how they go about their business from when they walk in the park""ù.

sports,Gauchos Look To Close Out Season Strong Against Cal Poly,8-May-18,1:26 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-look-to-close-out-season-strong-against-cal-poly/,"Veronica Gulvin winds up to pitch. Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus † Heading into their final conference series this weekend against four-spot rival Cal Poly, the UCSB softball team seeks one last shot at a win to once and for all put an end to the grim 2018 season.  Last weekend's wipeout against UC Riverside will undoubtedly test the Gauchos' ability to play whole-heartedly this weekend considering UCR shut them out in just five innings in their latest matchup.  Santa Barbara, now on a five-game losing streak, walks into their upcoming games with a lowly 5-13 conference record which translates to just 18-33 overall. Cal Poly, on the other hand, poses a big threat to the Gauchos. The Mustangs are riding a momentous wave of pride after defeating No. 17 Cal State Fullerton, the leaders in the Big West conference, 3-0 last Sunday.  They currently rank fourth in conference, winning eight out of the 18 total games so far. Though they lost their latest series, their performance this weekend put the team at a 24-23 overall record, pushing their game percentage over the .500 †mark.  Nonetheless, the Gauchos have no reason not to leave everything out on the field on Friday and Saturday.  With combined efforts from stand-out Big West players like Maci Fines, Sammy Fabian and Emily Schuttish, Santa Barbara has the potential to finally turn the tide for themselves. The three freshmen threaten opponents from all directions.  Fines's and Fabian's combined success at the plate totals 43 hits so far; that translates to just below a third of the hits produced by the nine-person lineup in conference.  On the mound, Schuttish has proven to have matured immensely since Big West play came around, even when the games ended up being devastating losses.  Her latest appearance happened against former competitor UC Riverside, whose 13 runs admittedly threw a wrench into her mojo last Saturday.  In the games she has thrown all seven innings, however, the pitcher has held opponents to five runs or less. She holds onto the lowest in-conference ERA in the SB bullpen at 4.42.  At this point, though, it would be unfair to leave out Cal Poly's contributions to this equation.  Santa Barbara's ""úlow""ù 4.42 ERA exceeds that of three out of four of the SLO's pitchers.  Senior powerhouse Lindsey Chalmers will undoubtedly bring the heat should she face SB this weekend. The right-handed vet boasts a 19-9 pitching record while keeping her ERA down low at 2.24 overall and at an even lower 1.39 in conference.  Her consistent success earned her back-to-back Big West Conference Pitcher of the Week awards, the first a result of Chalmers's first no-hitter. She beat out Santa Barbara's Felisha Noriega that week.  Whether or not Cal Poly throws Chalmers or not, Santa Barbara's offense must be alive and ready to play. Though Santa Barbara typically produces the baserunners they need, their efforts at the plate lately have not extended to producing the runs needed to win. However, their failure to close out games is also due to the lack of consistency in the field.  Since the onset of the season in February, there have been just nine games in which the Gauchos have gone error-free.  In the past two series alone, UCSB committed 14 defensive mistakes, and while this is by no means entirely to blame for their recent losses, it does take a big toll on the team's success rate.  Tightening up the defensive game can especially play a crucial role against a team like Cal Poly.  Though its offense is consistent enough to turn out wins, its game records reveal a very low-scoring pattern. In only one of the Mustangs' eight wins in Big West so far have they scored more than five runs against an opponent.  Comparatively, though they have won only five games, SB scored above five runs in three of those five wins. Santa Barbara has the drive, the capability, the potential for success; it has peaked on the field and at the plate all season. And though the end of the season crept quickly behind the shadows of loss after loss, Friday and Saturday grant the Gauchos a final attempt at proving themselves as fierce competitors.  UCSB takes their closing series back home to Santa Barbara at Campus Diamond beginning Friday at 3 p.m. followed by a double header on Saturday starting at 1 p.m.

sports,Gauchos Swept In Riverside Series,8-May-18,1:13 PM,['Andrew Strauss'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-08/gauchos-swept-in-riverside-series/,"The team watches intently as Alyssa Diaz swings at a pitch. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After losing the first game by two in an exciting 13-11 loss, the Gauchos seemed lost out on the field in the last two games. They seemed to let the 9-3 loss yesterday affect their play, as they came out of the gates Sunday seemingly unprepared to face a newly confident Highlander team. Right off the bat, the Gauchos seemed to be outmatched. After the Gauchos only got one hit in the first inning, the Highlanders came out ready to swing, getting three hits, one short of UCSB's total on the day. The three hits helped bring in a run, and Hannah Rodriquez also came home off of a wild pitch. After a second inning where the Highlanders scored two runs off of a double by Hannah Rodriquez double, the Gauchos were still within striking distance. However, the Highlanders put the game away in the bottom of the third. With the Gauchos still scoreless, the Highlanders started to roll, and circled through their whole rotation while also bringing in 6 runs. From there, both sides seemed to sense the inevitability of the contest, and two innings later, it was over. The Highlanders were buoyed by their starting pitcher Taylor Misfeldt, who allowed only 4 hits on her way to earn her 17th win on the season, the most on her team. On the Gaucho side, sophomore Felisha Noriega took the start for the day. Unfortunately, she didn't get very far, letting up 4 runs in the first and second inning, and was relieved by junior Veronika Gulvin. With this loss, Felisha dropped below .500, going 6-7 on the year. The substitutions didn't fare much better, as both Veronika and her replacement, senior Lena Mayer, let up 5 runs. Veronika was pulled during the third inning, after her fifth run came in on a wild pitch. With Lena now pitching in the bottom of the third, she let up a wild pitch, which brought in a run, but was able to end the inning. However, she let up an additional four more runs in the fourth inning, and with head coach Brie Galicinao electing not to put in any more pitchers, Lena ended the game for the Gauchos. On the offensive side of the ball, there weren't many bright spots for the Gauchos. One of the lone positives for the Gauchos was sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez, who continued to swing well, getting two hits. However, with 6 of her Gaucho teammates going hitless, the offense was absent. For the Highlanders, no one individual stood out, but the team as a whole hit well. Three people had two hit games, and four people had two runs. Danielle Ortega did seem to shine brightest amongst the stars, with a triple in the third inning that cleared three runs in and seemed to seal the game. The Highlanders were simply much more potent on offense, and the Gauchos did not seem to have an answer. Ending the series on a 14-0 loss, the Gauchos hope to recover against Cal Poly this weekend, where they play a Mustangs team that is 8-10 in conference play and coming off a Cal State Fullerton win. The Mustangs should get some confidence from that, considering that was only Fullerton's second loss of Big West play. Cal Poly comes to UCSB this weekend, with the first game on Friday, and the doubleheader on Saturday. This will be the Gauchos last series of the year, and we'll see if they can go out on a good note.

Christina DeMarzo / Daily NexusAfter going undefeated in conference play en route to its fourth consecutive Big West title, the UCSB men's tennis team punched their ticket to the NCAA tournament. Now, however, the Gauchos will have their biggest challenge of the season: a first round matchup against No.10 USC (17-8, 6-2) in front of a hostile away crowd in Los Angeles. The Gauchos (18-6, 5-0) enter the match looking to make waves on the national level; while they have made it to four straight tournaments, they have failed to make it past the first round on each occasion. This year, however, this team has momentum on its side. Winners of ten straight matches""îincluding a 43-0 point differential in their last seven matches""îSanta Barbara is a very different team than it was earlier in the season when the Gauchos faltered to a 6-5 start. When these two teams did meet up for the second match of the year, the Trojans won the match in dominant fashion by a score of 6-1. The only victory for the Gauchos on that day came from freshman Victor Krustev, although senior captain Simon Freund, sophomore Joseph Guillin and junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran all pushed their opponents to three sets. However, Santa Barbara has developed into a much more consistent team as the season has worn on. Moreno de Alboran has won 11 of his last 12 matches and was recently named the Big West Player of the Year. In addition, Freund and Guillin were named All-Big West first team singles. In particular, Guillin has shown significant growth as the season has worn on, finishing the season 19-2 despite moving his way up to the two spot. USC remained fairly dominant throughout the entirety of the season, finishing the season 8-3 at home. Their only two conference losses of the season came against UCLA, who is currently ranked No.1 in the country. The Gauchos will likely have to depend on their singles players more than usual, as USC has been nearly unbeatable in doubles play this year. On court one, they are 17-5 on the season, while on court two they are 17-4.  One of the more intriguing matchups between the two sides will be the match between Moreno de Alboran and USC sophomore Brandon Holt, who is currently the No.10-ranked singles player in the country. When the two first met, Holt eked out a victory in three sets ""î a trend Moreno de Alboran will surely look to reverse this go around. In addition, Guillin will have his hands full on court two, as he will be matched up against No.74 freshman Daniel Cukierman, who has a 13-5 record at the No. 2 spot. If the Gauchos hope to keep up with the high-powered Trojan team, they will likely have to pull off an upset in at least one of those matchups. Where USC is more vulnerable, however, is at the lower court spots. They are 11-10 on court three, 9-8 on court four, and 11-9 on court five ""î all places where the Gauchos can potentially pick up victories. On court three, Freund is riding a 10-game winning streak, playing some of the best tennis of his career. On court four, junior Anders Holm, who was recently named All-Big West second team, will look to use his experience to pick up a key victory for the 'Chos. The Gauchos know they will have their work cut out for them; after all, they are facing a top ten team on the road. But they also know that to make the waves they want to make, to be a national powerhouse, they have to beat the best. The Gauchos will take on the Trojans on Saturday at 3 p.m. at the Marks Tennis Center on the USC campus. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the May 10, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Freshman 10: Maci Fines' Transition To The College Game,10-May-18,5:10 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/freshman-10-maci-fines-transition-to-the-college-game/,"Maci Fines slap-hits in an attempt to get on base. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus ""úDon't tell me ""òyou'll get it next time', tell me to get it next time,""ù Maci told me when asked what kind of feedback she responds to best. The self-motivated, driven nature of UCSB's rookie Maci Fines colors practically everything she sets her mind to both on and off the field.  It is these instinctual qualities that lent themselves to Maci accomplishing the biggest hitting turnaround Gaucho softball saw this 2018 season from pre-conference games into Big West play, boosting her batting average from just .229 to a current .397 in-conference.  Fines came into UCSB with a momentous wave of accolades following closely behind her""îSacramento All-City Team Honors, Delta League First Team, you name it. By her senior year, the Elk Grove native tallied a whopping 201 hits in her four-year career, both breaking her high school's record and becoming just one of 15 girls in California to ever reach 200 hits.  Things changed drastically, however, once she swapped her well-worn Sheldon High School jersey for the collegiate blue and gold Santa Barbara letters.  Maci made her collegiate debut as the shortstop back in February against Santa Clara where she went 2 for 3 on the day, an event that had Fines ""úanxious to see how the rest of the season would play out.""ù  Posted at the top of the offensive lineup, the lefty saw perhaps the most opportunities at the plate for offensive success; however, with this inevitably comes the potential for expected failure. For the next games""îall 30 of them""îup until the onset of the Big West conference, Fines replicated that initial success only twice more. The rest of her attempts equated to just 20 hits in her 87 at-bats. Though not a terrible ratio by any means, Fines' lack of consistency was certainly not what she was used to per her glorified high school reign. No longer in the comfort of her hometown, Fines quickly realized it was time to take her game into her own hands. The accessibility of one-on-one coaching from father Edwin Fines, for example, was not an valid method of practice anymore. ""úWhen I was home I would work out everyday with my dad offensively and defensively,""ù Fines said.  She continued that, after arriving to college, ""úI had to figure out how to motivate myself and go out there on my own.""ù  The infielder admitted that the switch began to flip after the first game of Big West in which the Gauchos faced UC Davis. By then, Maci's place in the lineup dropped from first to last as she went 0 for 3 on the day.  After the series, Fines recalls Coach Galicinao calling her into her office for a meeting. ""úCoach put confidence in me, [reassuring] me that she was believing in me. I like when coaches are honest with me. She pushes us really hard""ù  From there Maci did some soul-searching. With acute focus on perfecting her technical skills and a clear motivation to be the best player she knew she could be, Fines completely turned her season on its side.  ""úIt was tough when I was struggling for a little bit, but I never got too worried. I knew what I was capable of and the work I've put in. I just had to get back to the basics, and it would come around.""ù Instantly, then, the record-breaking, hit-hungry Maci Fines that entered Santa Barbara's program resurged from the shadows as an offensive powerhouse with an undeniable influence on the team as a whole.  Statistically, the lefty showed immense improvement in her physical game. She racked at least four hits in five out of six of the series of Big West, going on at most a five-game hit streak.  Over half of Fines' 43 hits on the season""î23 to be exact""îcan be attributed to a Big West series. She currently boasts the highest in-conference batting average in the Gaucho lineup, coming in at a hot .397.  As Fines mentioned before, she possessed all the attributes needed to achieve this elite level of play, it was just a matter of honing in and utilizing them all at once. She was determined to prove that every hour of daily training coming into and while in college was worthwhile. The rookie's drive to improve dates back to when she was young, competing constantly with her older sister Jordan, the original softball stud of the family""îby date, of course. As they grew older, Fines reflected that, between them, softball was always a competition.  ""úShe [Jordan] committed [to Cal Berkeley] a year before me, and all the attention was on her, and I was like no; I wanted to do something too.""ù The freshman's internal fire for betterment inevitably reveals itself in the attitude she puts forth towards her team as well.  Fellow infielder and close friend Sierra Altmeyer, called ""úCC""ù by Maci, observed, ""úShe takes every opportunity she can to improve her athletic ability. She is competitive and always making people around her better by inspiring them to be the best they can be.""ù  Though her individual success could not alone carry the team to the wins they needed, the qualities as aforementioned have made an already-noticeable impact on her teammates. † Altmeyer summed up Fines' contributions to the team, saying: ""úHer ability to compete and her energy is contagious and spreads to the team. Her being a freshman and being able to show up and play every game to her full potential has been an aspect we needed on our team to keep us all humble and compete every pitch,""ù Altmeyer said. † She followed up with, ""úTo now be our starting short stop, she has earned the teams' respect and has proven to us she has what it takes to be a leader.""ù  And a leader she will be; Fines humbly recognizes the improvements she has already made since being at UCSB, commenting, ""úMentally I've definitely learned how to keep my composure and stay poised. Not playing on too much emotion helped me stay consistent throughout each game, letting things go.""ù  Fines added that she hopes in seasons to come she becomes a better leader on the team, as well as continue to improve her work ethic and personal game. † The Gauchos face Cal Poly this weekend for their final series of the Big West conference, and while this may be a reprieve to the team's suffering season, the games will preview what are just the early stages of the very dedicated Maci Fines' legacy on the UCSB softball team.

sports,"UCSB In Must-Win Situation, Heads To Long Beach",10-May-18,5:05 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-10/ucsb-in-must-win-situation-heads-to-long-beach/,"Armani Smith is ready for the ball to be pitched. Angie Banks/Daily Nexus After dropping two out of three this past weekend to CSUN and losing two more games in a doubleheader against Pepperdine on Tuesday, things are really starting to look bleak for the UCSB baseball team and its slim playoff hopes as it travels to Long Beach State. ""úWe are hanging in there. Obviously we have been really frustrated the last few games feeling like we are right there and having chances to win the game, but we are growing up and we have to do it fast,""ù Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. Currently sitting at 22-22-1 on the year overall and 7-8 in the Big West, Santa Barbara finds themselves at No. 6 in the conference standings and a good five games behind first place Cal State Fullerton. With just nine games left in the league schedule and the almost certain fate that the winner of the Big West will be the only one to receive a NCAA Regional bid, UCSB is running out of time to lose any more contests this season. ""úWinning out is our only shot. We are going to have to do that, and with the way Fullerton has played, hope they somehow lose some,""ù Checketts said. Even worse, this weekend the Gauchos will be headed on the road to face the rival Dirtbags. On the road this season, UCSB is 4-10. Conversely, LBSU is 11-12 at home this season and just recently defeated UCLA on the road, 5-1. ""úWe won at Blair Field two years ago, and it felt like that was the only time we ever did it,""ù Checketts said. ""úIt is such a tough place traditionally, and wins are harder to come by so we need to be able to execute.""ù One thing the Gauchos definitely have going for them, however, is their starting pitching. Taking the mound on Friday will be senior right-hander Stevie Ledesma, who pitched a complete shutout game his last start, earning the win. On the year, he currently has a 2.16 ERA, which is the second-best mark in the entire conference. Usually a Friday starter, sophomore righty Chris Lincoln has been pushed back to Saturday as he tries to recuperate from a back issue that forced him out of his last start earlier than he would've wanted to. His early exit resulted in a loss for the ""òChos. On the year, Lincoln's 2.35 ERA is the third-best mark in the Big West. At the plate, sophomore Tommy Jew has been as hot as anyone, as he still has the best batting average on the team with a .301. However, if the Gauchos want sustained success it needs bigger contributions from guys like sophomore Armani Smith, who has done a lot better as of late. One point batting under .200 on the year, Smith is now batting .221 and since April 22 has gone 9 for 23 at the plate with 10 RBI's. Despite his struggles this year, it's clear Smith is still very much putting in the effort ""î a sign of good things to come. ""úHe's hit for more power on the year with more doubles and homers, but he has also struck out more,""ù Checketts said. ""úHe's swung the bat better lately, and he's a kid you root for. He's a great kid so we are happy to see that.""ù Like Santa Barbara, Long Beach State is also 7-8 in conference play and tied for sixth place, but they seem to have more confidence due to their four-game winning streak. Overall, the Dirtbags boast a 22-26 record on the year. In their last four wins, LBSU has won by an average of 3.5 runs. At the plate this season, Long Beach State currently has the worst batting average in the entire league, sporting a .243 average, but in the last four games has managed a much better .315 at the dish. The Dirtbags also have two players currently batting above .300 on the season, which is always a nice luxury to have. Even more impressive is one of those two players batting over .300, junior Clayton Andrews, is also the team's star pitcher. Andrews currently sports a 2.58 ERA on the season which is the best mark on the team and fifth-best total in the conference while his 92 punchouts are the second best mark in the Big West. This is the Rohnert Park native's first season with the team; before this he spent two years playing at Cabrillo College where he was awarded with the league's player of the year honors. In his last start against UC Riverside Saturday, Andrews had a career day as he went registered four hits, tying his career high, with one RBI and struck out a career-high 13 batters in eight innings of work. Due to his pitching performance, Andrews earned Player of the Week honors. This weekend will be a tough one for the Gauchos, but at the end of the day, if they even want a chance to make the postseason, they need to win. This team has grown a lot over the year, and no matter what happens, the future looks bright. ""úThere has been some growth and maturity with this team through our failures, and these next two weeks are going to be very challenging, but we have talent here. We just have to play hard, quality baseball, not worry about that outside stuff and we will be fine,""ù Checketts said. UCSB takes on LBSU for game one at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 11 at Blair Field.

sports,"Gauchos Finish Strong, Take Series to Close Out Uphill Season",13-May-18,5:20 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-13/gauchos-finish-strong-take-series-to-close-out-uphill-season/,"Andy Lau/Daily Nexus It's been just under a month since UCSB bested a team for the majority of games in a 3-game set, but the ""òChos rolled over a sliding Cal Poly squad to close out their rough season on a high note. UCSB bested the Mustangs in games one and two of the series by scores of 10-9 and 5-4 respectively before ultimately dropping the series finale to Cal Poly with a 5-1 loss. UCSB finished the year with 20 wins and 34 losses, a disappointing downfall after the 31-28 season that the Gauchos completed during the 2017 season. Not only did the Gauchos lose 63% of its games this season, but UCSB finished in the eighth and final place of the Big West Conference with a 7-14 conference record, coming out on top in only one third of interleague contests. With the series loss, Cal Poly dropped to 25-25 overall, 9-12 in conference play to finish in the fifth spot in the Big West Conference. Although the shadow hanging over Santa Barbara's season may be gloomy, UCSB looked fairly dominant in its final series of the 2018 season. The series opener slipped in the Gaucho's favor after huge run production in the sixth and seventh innings to send the contest into extra innings. Some late-game heroics by junior shortstop Melanie Menor drove in the winning run on a walk off single in the bottom of the ninth inning to win a 10-9 standoff as the infamous Blue-Green Rivalry kicked off for the final time this season. Santa Barbara carried over this momentum into the Saturday doubleheader and managed to perform on a supreme level in the first game of the day as the Gauchos displayed overwhelming power at the plate that has been lacking for much of the year. A first inning 3 RBI double by sophomore first baseman Hailey Martin propelled the Mustangs out in front early, but junior second baseman Sierra Altmeyer had an immediate answer come her first plate appearance of the day. Altmeyer responded with a 3-run jack of her own to even up the game at 3-3, her seventh bomb of the year. Complimented by a solo shot by sophomore center fielder Rayna Cohen, the Gauchos were tied at 4 runs a piece heading into the bottom of the seventh inning. Boosted by a walk-off single in game one of the series, UCSB felt confident with their cleanup hitter stepping up to the dish with 2 outs in the final inning of play. Altmeyer blasted her team-best 8th long ball of the 2018 season to walk-off Santa Barbara in dramatic fashion with a 5-4 win and pull out the team's first series win since mid-April. This homerun marks UCSB's third walk-off hit in conference play on the year. The second base standout has turned it on in the final stretch of the season going 4-9 in the last series of the year with 2 deep bombs and 5 RBIs as she improved her batting average to .323 in her third season with Santa Barbara. The Gauchos raked senior ace Lindsey Chalmers on two appearances over the weekend as she longed for the ever-coveted 20-win mark. The only thing standing in her way was the hidden power displayed from UCSB bats. Chalmers was limited to 8.2 innings pitched over two starts and allowed 11 runs in the process. She finished with an 8.99 ERA over the course of the three-game series dropping her holistic season earned run average to 2.57 as she was unable to come up victorious in either of her two starts. The righty ended the season with 19 wins and 9 losses, nonetheless good for second most wins in the Big West. While the first two games decided the outcome of the series winner, Cal Poly didn't complacently lay down in the team's season finale. UCSB came out firing as Rayna Cohen drove in sophomore infielder Genesis Ramirez to thrust ahead in the bottom of the first inning. From there, both offenses remained silent until Poly erupted for a 5-run fourth inning which caused sophomore southpaw Felisha Noriega to see her day come to an end. For the next 3.1 innings, junior right-handed pitcher Veronika Gulvin maintained composure by allowing only 1 hit in her final appearance of the year. Gulvin hasn't particularly lived up to each and every expectation this season, yet this past weekend she shined bright and previewed some special talent that we look forward to seeing next season. The junior threw 6.2 innings over two appearances against the Mustangs allowing only 1 run throughout the weekend. Although Gulvin was dominant, she didn't receive much help from the offense as UCSB dropped its final game of the series by a score of 5-1. Gaucho pitching struggled immensely this year as three of the four active pitchers culminated their seasons with ERAs over 5.0. Yet the future is bright for UCSB! We saw promising performances from many young and well-rounded players. Freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian finished off her year with a team-best .335 batting average and displayed sheer and dominant speed early in the season. I would love to see more aggressive baserunning in conference play from Fabian since finished fourth in stolen bases in the Big West, although all of the steals came prior to Big West play. Inversely, freshman infielder Maci Fines was unreal come conference play. She started out the year batting roughly .229 in the former half of the season, but once she started to compete with Big West teams, the third baseman began to produce at exponentially high levels. She hit a near .400 in Big West play which rose her batting average on the year to .290. The Gauchos also have young help in the circle. Freshman pitcher Emily Schuttish came alive in the latter half of the season as she was the go-to starter for conference play. Her most prominent month of starts came during April in which UCSB saw a rise in strikeouts per 7 innings from 3.72 to 4.70. Schuttish only saw .1 innings worth of time in the circle during May and we saw a destructive increase in ERA as it rose from 3.81 in April to 8.08 in May. There should be more of Schuttish next season as the ace on this Gaucho team. Hopefully, the soon-to-be second year compliments the other young batters well enough to improve on the 34-loss season. Furthermore, its essential for junior second baseman Sierra Altmeyer and sophomore first baseman Alyssa Diaz to assume a major leadership role over the offseason and take control of this team to smoothly usher in the younger players. Both infielders have a distinguishable leadership role on the team and must continue to push the rest of their Gaucho squad in order to improve in seasons to come.

sports,Breaking Down the Fan-Favorite Players of the NBA Playoffs,17-May-18,5:00 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/breaking-down-the-fan-favorite-players-of-the-nba-playoffs/," The NBA playoffs are where each team's championship aspirations are put to the test and we get to find out who the real contenders are. Every playoff team has a star that knows how to get it done, but it often takes the elevated play of an unsuspecting player or two in order to push them to the next level.  These players often attain nationwide admiration for clutch play, team leadership, and even relevance in popular meme culture. These qualities mix with the high-intensity of playoff basketball to create a lovable underdog in the eyes of fans. Here is the breakdown of the three most impressive fan-favorite players of the 2018 playoffs so far.  Joe Ingles:   † Any player who is a marksman from deep and a fiery trash-talker is guaranteed †to become a fan favorite in his home arena as well as with fans around the country. When that guy looks like everyone's ""úcool""ù high school english teacher and he gets buckets in the playoffs, he reaches another level of admiration.  Joe ""úJumping Joe""ù Ingles has solidified his role as a key player for the Utah Jazz as they surged to end the regular season and kept their momentum moving into the playoffs, where they took down the Thunder in the first round. Ingles lit up OKC for 20+ points two separate times in the six-game series, but it is easy to argue that his most important contribution was getting in Paul George's head and significantly affecting his play.  This all culminated in an atrocious 2-16 shooting performance by George in game 6, proving once and for all that Australian trash-talk is one of the most detrimental forms of trash-talk that exists today.  Ingles cooled off slightly as the Jazz fell to the top-seeded Rockets in round two, but he did drop a signature 27-point performance in Utah's lone win in that series. Joe Ingles has clearly found himself a place on an up-and-coming Utah team that should be a major threat in the upcoming years.  Rajon Rondo  The resurgence of ""úPlayoff Rondo""ù became a major storyline in the playoffs that coincided with the surprise run to the second round by the New Orleans Pelicans. Rondo looked like a lifeless corpse on the basketball court in his seasons without playoff basketball since he left the Celtics in 2014, and we have all been waiting to see what he was capable of with a solid team around him.  The opportunity finally presented itself alongside All-Stars Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis in New Orleans, where he finally seemed focused on both ends of the floor and put up some impressive numbers in the team's two playoff series (10.3 points, 7.6 rebounds, 12.2 assists).  Rondo had several monster statistical games including a 10 rebound, 21 assist game in a home win over the Warriors, but maybe the most impressive part of ""úPlayoff Rondo""ù has been the leadership that he showed as one of the few veterans with championship experience on the roster.  He was often seen calling out plays and defensive adjustments from the bench as well as standing up for his teammates and not backing down to players like Draymond Green. Rajon Rondo is one of the most unique players in the NBA today and it is clear that he still has some good basketball left in the tank, so hopefully we will see more stellar play from him in the future. † Terry Rozier  ""úScary Terry""ù sounds like the title of a low-budget 80's horror movie rather than an NBA player's nickname. But it does stand true that there is nothing scarier than finding yourself guarding Rozier one-on-one in the open floor, just ask Eric Bledsoe (too soon?).  Whatever you wish to call him, Terry Rozier has stepped up in the absence of All-Star Kyrie Irving throughout these playoffs and been a must-watch player in his own right.  His clutch shooting and his beef with Eric Bledsoe made numerous headlines as the understaffed Celtics took down the Bucks in a thrilling 7 game series. He followed that up by going up another level to slow down the red-hot Sixers and beat them in 5 games.  Scary Terry is averaging an astounding 18.2 points, 5.8 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game throughout the first two rounds, a substantial increase from his regular season averages of 11.3, 2.9, and 4.7. †Part of Rozier's likeability comes from his exciting, fast-paced style of play, lights-out shooting (39.6% from three on 8 attempts per game), and his numerous highlight-reel finishes over helpless defenders.  His attempts to embrace the outpour of admiration have only increased the magnitude of his legend among fans and if he ends up leading the Celtics to a possible NBA finals birth, ""úScary Terry""ù might be a name that is forever inscribed into Celtics lore.

sports,Gauchos Cross Blue Line with Winningest Season in UCSB History,17-May-18,5:10 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/gauchos-cross-blue-line-with-winningest-season-in-ucsb-history/,"Sierra Deak A mere three years. Less than a third of a decade after the team was finally recommissioned and ready to compete, the UCSB Hockey team found itself sitting on the first championship victory in program history as a part of the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association and proud winners of the ever coveted Adams Cup. With such unprecedented success in a token couple of seasons, the question remains: How did this fresh legs Gaucho squad come up so successfully in the playoffs? Many teams thrive on veteran leadership from experienced third- and fourth-year players to smooth out a transition for the younger guys. Yet with such an infamous history, or more applicably the lack thereof, this squad saw only eight returners in their championship year. A team made up of 60 percent new members is rarely considered a favorite to win a championship, but the fresh legs on UCSB are unique for a group of first-year competitors. The freshman presence is significant, but these young men are no strangers to playoff and championship experience. The addition of freshman center Collin del Bonis was crucial to the Gauchos' success this year. Del Bonis thrived in crunch time during high school games as he, accompanied by long-time teammates forward Chris Ewasiuk, defensemen Emmett Rupert and goalie Will Hahn, led the Santa Barbara Royals to back-to-back high school championships in the Los Angeles Kings Hockey League in each of two seasons prior, paving a path for each of them to transition to UCSB hockey. Once the key pieces were initiated at the collegiate level, the team knew success was imminent. Imminent, not immediate. It took a couple games for these first-year studs to get their ice legs back on track, but once the team got rolling, boy, did they look like a legitimate threat to make a run for the PCHA title. ""úAfter the first two or three [games], I was ready to go,""ù del Bonis said when asked about how his preparation ritual had changed with the transition from high school hockey to collegiate level competition. ""úWe had 12 new guys on the team including me""¶ so we didn't have any chemistry going into those first two games.""ù Santa Barbara struggled through the opening two games as new roles were assumed and new rotations were learned. As if it weren't enough that UCSB was ushering in the majority of a new squad, the Gauchos had a tall task in front of them in Santa Clara University. The Broncos were coming off the 2016 season as runners-up for the Adams Cup and they were on a mission for vengeance.
On back-to-back days in the latter half of October, UCSB dropped two losses to Santa Clara by scores of 6-2 and 3-1 to kick off the 2017 season. However, rather than being demoralized, these young puck handlers quickly became comfortable in their new roles as chemistry gradually grew within the clubhouse over the next week. With a couple games, a hiccup of adversity and a stern week of practice under the squad's belt, the Gauchos fiercely bounced back with two commanding wins, the first coming with a 4-1 score against Cal Lutheran. On Oct. 29, UCSB faced off against Stanford and displayed sheer dominance on the ice while scoring a remarkable 15 goals en route to a shutout of the Cardinals. It seemed fitting that this game took place only a couple of days before Halloween because the Gauchos were starting to look like frightening competitors. Much of the success for the quick turnaround was accredited to impeccable leadership from an experienced coaching staff that has handled its fair share of adversity. Courtesy of Ice Hockey at UCSB's Facebook page Former Boston Bruin and assistant coach Steve Heinze led the high school squad of Collin del Bonis and the rest of the Santa Barbara Royals to consecutive championships prior to taking a position with UCSB, so not only is he weathered in terms of hockey knowledge, but Coach Heinze also has a history with many of the first-year players which smoothed the transition in collegiate level competition.
""úIf we can just approach [games] with a mindset that we're going to outwork them""¶you can teach X's and O's and pretty plays to anybody, but what I would like to instill with these guys is hard work wins games,""ù Henize said. When it comes down to crunch times and the postseason, Henize went on to preach rest and care for the body, saying, ""úwe get in shape and then we go and outwork them.""ù
The staunch squad continued to ride their confidence high rolling into the final game of 2017 on a four-game win streak before resuming play once again in 2018 as the team shifted gears to conference play. UCSB completed the season with seven wins and five losses, a step behind their success in the 2016-2017 season in which they finished 9-6 in UCSB's first season as a part of the Division II Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association.
In contrast to last year, however, the Gauchos broke the seal with a playoff berth in just their second year in the division.
Over Presidents' Day weekend, the Gauchos traveled to Lake Tahoe to compete for the Adams Cup and prove their dominance over the West. With a blowout win against Stanford and an outlasting performance against Cal Lutheran, the Ice ""òChos found themselves matched up with none other than the Santa Clara Broncos, the very team that dropped UCSB in its first two games of the season.
But this was a very different Gaucho team than at the beginning of the season. A much more well-rounded and composed squad, the Gauchos have matured and developed immense chemistry throughout the course of the season.
Heading into the matchup against Santa Clara, the entire roster was feeling confident and poised as they looked the rival Broncos dead in the eye from point-blank range. Third-year forward Jackson Schutz assumed a unique leadership role as one of the older players on the team though competing in his first season of hockey with UCSB. ""úThe skill has always been present on the team. We have the ability to beat Santa Clara,""ù Schutz said when questioned about the team's legitimacy come postseason. He went on to praise his squad, saying, ""úour first two games of the season, we were just getting to know each other""¶ now at the end of the season, we know each other's styles of play so well.""ù Through the first two periods in the Gauchos championship match up, the team looked to be in complete control as they built onto a 6-1 lead heading into the final period of the season. Yet a strong start didn't quite get UCSB out of the woods as Santa Clara answered with an unprecedented five goals in the final period as the fate of each of their seasons was left to a mere shootout. Leave it to none other than freshman standout Collin del Bonis to finesse the walk-off goal in the extra time to send the Gauchos into the offseason elated with the program's first hockey championship in only three years of being established. The Gauchos rode the isthmus of victory down the canal of the Adams cup and ultimately etched their names into the history books.
With such a young and talented team to compliment the tremendous coaching leadership, the future for the ""òChos is looking as bright as ever. A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the May 17th, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Fall to USC in NCAA Tournament,17-May-18,12:21 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/gauchos-fall-to-usc-in-ncaa-tournament/,"From the sheer force of running after the ball, Joseph Guillin's hat falls off. Siavash Ghadirir/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's tennis team's season ended in heartbreak on Saturday when the Gauchos narrowly fell to the No.10 ranked USC Trojans, 4-1. Despite the score, Santa Barbara put itself in a prime position to win the NCAA tournament matchup. After dropping the doubles point and singles on court four, freshman Victor Krustev won easily on court six to bring UCSB within a point. All of the other singles matches went to three sets, with the Trojans ultimately eking out victories on courts five and one to take the match before the contested matches on courts two and three could be decided. ""úWe put ourselves in a great position to win that match but didn't get over the finish line,""ù Head Coach Marty Davis said. ""úThat win would have covered the only two goals we didn't accomplish: top 40 ranking and NCAA Tournament win.""ù Regardless of the ending, this Gauchos team proved they had the character and skill to play with the top teams in the nation this season. After starting the season 6-5 ""î with all five of those losses on the road ""î UCSB flipped a switch, winning 12 of their last 14 matches en-route to an 18-7 overall record. During that span, Santa Barbara picked up road victories over No.49 Washington and No.50 Loyola Marymount. In addition, the Gauchos were dominant in Big West play, easily winning their fourth straight conference title and accomplishing the goal that Davis set for them at the beginning of the season. The team also set a Big West record by winning their conference games of a combined score of 43-0. ""úThe perfect score line in conference play is unbelievable, and a record that will never be topped,""ù Davis said. This team also once again established something that avid college tennis fans have long known: they have one of the best fan bases on the entire west coast. Propelled behind a raucous crowd at every home match, the Gauchos finished the season 11-0 at home ""î their second time going undefeated at home in the last three years. ""úThe undefeated streak at home is a testament to our wonderful fans, many of whom made it up to SLO for our match with Cal Poly and to USC last Saturday,""ù Davis said. ""úThe energy and atmosphere they provide is critical to the success we've enjoyed.""ù Individually, UCSB also experienced breakout seasons from many of their unproven players. Perhaps the most impressive example is sophomore Joseph Guillin. After transferring from Florida, Guillin started the season at the No.4 spot on the court, slowly climbing his way up as far as the No.1 spot. Overall, he finished the season with a 19-2 record, including seven wins out of his last eight matches. Krustev also left his mark in his first year: Despite not joining the team until January, Krustev finished 14-6 in singles play, and he and Guillin combined for an 11-4 record in doubles play on court three. On the top courts, the Gauchos once again received steady contributions from junior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and senior captain Simon Freund. On court one, Moreno De Alboran went 15-5 on the season, winning his last eight matches on the season. His dominance during conference play also earned him the Big West Player of the Year Award, as well as a spot at the singles NCAA tournament. Freund finished his career in fashion, winning his last ten matches in a row and finishing with an overall singles record of 17-5. In addition, Freund was nominated for the Arthur Ashe Leadership and Sportsmanship Award, while Moreno de Alboran was nominated for the ITA Player to Watch Award. Looking ahead to the future, the Gauchos will return all of their starters except for Freund, priming them to be even more dominant next season. In the meantime, however, the team will enjoy all they have accomplished this season. ""úI'm extremely proud of the way this team represented our university, our alumni and our former team members ""¶ both on and off the court,""ù Davis said.

sports,Gauchos Head to SLO for Match Against Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly,17-May-18,12:52 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-17/gauchos-head-to-slo-for-match-against-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/,"Chris Lincoln pitches the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus After dropping two of three at Long Beach last weekend, the UCSB baseball team was eliminated from postseason contention and will miss the NCAA Regional for the second-straight season. Despite that, Santa Barbara still has a lot to play for, including a chance to beat Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly for the first time since the 2015 season. ""úI told the guys this is our postseason,""ù Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. ""úThe rest of our season is our postseason and we should treat it as such. We want to have some upward momentum going into the end of the season and give our guys that aren't returning a good taste in our mouths.""ù The Mustangs have swept the Gauchos the past two seasons and will look to do so again this season as they currently own a 24-27 overall record, 9-9 conference mark. In the standings, they are five games behind first-place CSUF with six games to go. UCSB will travel to SLO boasting a 24-24-1 overall record and a 8-10 Big West mark. Santa Barbara is coming off a 6-5 walk-off victory against Cal State Bakersfield this past Tuesday. ""úThe effort has been better the last few games even in some of those losses to Long Beach last weekend. The guys grinded out a good win on Tuesday and we will go as far as our pitching takes us,""ù Checketts said. Along with playing its conference rival, the Gauchos are still in a very good position to finish the season strong, as with seven games to go, they can make it appoint to finish above .500, something they did not do last season, and improve upon its current seventh-place standing in the conference. Historically, UCSB has played well against Cal Poly as it currently owns a 93-73-1 record against its rivals, however, in the Andrew Checketts era, Santa Barbara has gone just 7-15 and has lost six straight to date. ""úWe have not played well against them the last few times and traditionally their place is a tough place to play at but we have to show up and execute it does not matter who is on the other side of the dugout, we want to play our best baseball,""ù Checketts said. ""úWe compete against each other in all facets of the game including recruiting so we do have that healthy rivalry and we want to win.""ù In order to not only just take one game from the Mustangs this weekend, but hopefully the whole series, the Gauchos will need excellent pitching performances from each of their starters and even their bullpen guys. In a 12-0 loss against LBSU on Saturday, starter right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln was rocked as he allowed six hits and seven runs in just 2.2 innings pitched. To be fair to the sophomore, he was coming off a nagging back injury he sustained the week before. This week, Lincoln will look to get back to form as his match against LBSU was definitely not the norm coaches and fans have come to expect from him. ""úHe couldn't land his off-speed pitches for strikes and he was fat in the middle of the plate when he was behind the count so that's a recipe for a bad start,""ù Checketts said. ""úHe hasn't had a stinker before that so I am looking forward to seeing him bounce back and respond.""ù UCSB will also need more meaningful contributions from the bullpen guys as junior Kevin Chandler has a 5.54 ERA in 15 appearances, freshman Chris Troye has a 4.82 ERA in 16 appearances and junior Alex Patterson has a 3.82 ERA in 21 appearances. In a Friday start, senior Stevie Ledesma had a solid outing and handed the bullpen an 8-4 lead but the Gauchos were unable to hold on losing the game 9-8. Games like this are what drives fans and the team crazy. This weekend in particular, the Gaucho pitching staff will have their work cut out for them as they are going up against a Cal Poly team that currently owns the best batting average (.273), slugging percentage (.375) and second-best on-base percentage (.408) in the Big West. Along with owning the conference's best batting average, the Mustangs also have two of the top-five best hitters in the conference. Outfielder Alex McKenna owns a .347 batting average which is the second-best in the Big West to go along with 30 RBI's. Catcher Nick Meyer has the fourth best batting average in the conference with a .333 percentage. Infielder Tate Samuelson has the most runs batted in with 37. For UCSB, this weekend is all about continuing the uphill trend. With an even overall record and much room for improvement, this team still has a lot to play for and while this season will not result in the National Championship, it could be what the team looks back on a year from now as to what made a dream run in the NCAA Tournament possible. ""úGoing to Omaha is not always a one-year process, sometimes it is a three, four, five-year process if we want to get back there and we can't wait until next fall because we want to go about everything the right way. We need to play with the mentality that we want to have next spring now,""ù Checketts said. Santa Barbara will take on Cal Poly for game one of a three-game set at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 18 at Robin Baggett Stadium.

sports,UCSB Drops Series Against Rival Mustangs,20-May-18,5:07 AM,['Andrew Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-20/ucsb-drops-series-against-rival-mustangs/,"Tommy Jew getting to first base before UCR can strike him out. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The UCSB baseball team gave up a one-run lead behind a pair of clutch Cal Poly Mustang hits in the bottom of the eighth inning, giving UCSB starter Chris Lincoln the loss and the Mustangs the 4-2 victory. The loss dropped the Gauchos to 24-26-1 on the year as they remained in seventh place in the Big West, while Cal Poly was bolstered up to third place in the conference and a 26-27 record. Freshman right-handed pitcher Joshua Candau came in to relieve for the Gauchos in the bottom of the eighth inning after Lincoln walked the first batter. Candau got the first out on a bunt attempt from sophomore Kyle Marinconz at the cost of the runner on first getting into scoring position. A fielding error at third base from Jason Willow allowed the subsequent batter Samuelson to get on base and the tying run within 90 feet of the plate. Candau was able to secure the crucial second out on a fly ball hit to left field which was caught. Junior Nick Meyer approached the plate and hit a bases clearing double to put the Mustangs ahead, 3-2. The pair of RBIs was Meyer's 26th and 27th of the season and was a clutch drive with his team down a run late in the game. Meyer crossed the plate a batter later on a single through the left side from sophomore Bradlee Beesley to make the score 4-2 in favor of the Mustangs. Candau was pulled from the game for freshman right-handed pitcher Chris Troye who was able to get out of the inning with no further damage. Cal Poly reliever Taylor Dollard, who came on midway through the seventh inning, closed out the Gauchos in the top of the ninth, to continue his team's two game winning streak. The 2.2 inning effort from the freshman earned Dollard his third win of the year. UCSB sophomore right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln put in seven innings of work in his start† today, giving up five hits and one earned run. Lincoln was stellar in his outing and was clearly in control as he made his around the Cal Poly lineup. The performance was a good showing from Lincoln, who suffered his worst start of the season the last time he had taken the mound in a May 12 start against the Long Beach State 49ers where he was pulled after seven earned runs. Despite taking the game past quality start territory, Lincoln was still unable to escape with a win due to the late-inning collapse from the bullpen. The Gauchos were first to put runs on the board in what was a fairly low-scoring game throughout. Sophomore Tommy Jew smashed his fifth homer of the season off of freshman right handed Cal Poly pitcher Darren Nelson in the bottom of the fourth inning to put the team ahead by one. The Mustangs quickly answered back an inning later, after a sequence of hits allowed sophomore Scott Ogrin to score. Sophomore Dylan Doherty singled through the left side and into the outfield for his sixteenth RBI of the season to tie up the game at one all. The sixth inning brought on the third consecutive one with a run scored, as Gaucho freshman Drew Williams lined a double to right center field which would bring junior Clay Fisher home from second. The run was Fisher's 32nd and Williams' fourteenth RBI of the year to put UCSB in the lead, 2-1. The contributions from Fisher and Williams were great to see, but the offense stagnated after taking the lead. The UCSB Gauchos will play their final game of the series against rival Cal Poly Mustangs at Baggett Stadium on Sunday, May 20 at 1 PM PST.

sports,Black Tide: Ultimately More Than a Club,23-May-18,5:09 AM,['Andrew Strauss'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-23/black-tide-ultimately-more-than-a-club/," I sat down with three of the captains from our Men's Club Ultimate Frisbee team, Arthur Pan, Bailey Wu, and Alec Kupelian  † What do you guys think are some key things about Black Tide and ultimate frisbee in general that people may not know about? † AP: Personally, for me, it was a lot more competitive and provided a lot more opportunities than I originally thought. I came from baseball, and I realized that ultimate frisbee gives you the opportunity to make big plays, like laying out or jumping over people (which we call skying). † BW: I guess the sport has a big stigma when it comes to the word frisbee in general. You don't really think of it as a serious sport, you think of it as being in the park or on the beach, but like Arthur said, when you get to college, you see all the intricacies that do come with it, like defenses, or zone or specific skill sets that each player has. † What are some myths about ultimate that you guys would like to dispel?  † AP: I think most people find it super nerdy or hippie, or casual, but in the college level it's pretty competitive. † When do most people tend to join the team? † AP: Well, I would say most people join it their freshman year, yeah. † BW: I definitely agree with that, but we also get some later years. Whether people hear from their friends or they come in and transfer, we do get some kids who come in after their freshman year, but the majority are definitely freshmen. † Cool. So, on more of a long term note, what do you think was your favorite part of Black Tide, or the thing you'll look back on 10 years from now?  † AP: Ooh tough question. † BW: Well, going back to your last question, it's really cool how you're able to incorporate all these people from different sports, because very rarely are you able to get someone who played frisbee all through high school. For the most part, it's a team with people who have played soccer, football, golf, baseball, volleyball, tennis, really just a huge variety of sports. You formulate the team and each player can incorporate their previous experience into a role on a team. I would say that's one of my favorite parts of Ultimate Frisbee. † AP: I would say that for me, when I look back, I'm going to look back at all my teammates. Me and Bailey are both graduating this spring, and there's been a lot of college defining moments with frisbee. I feel like I've really grown up with my class rookies, and I learned how to balance a workload with school and practice and hanging out with everybody. Just the whole experience of the team and even beyond the sport itself. † So how often does the team practice?  † AP: We practice two days a week on the field and two days of lifting, and then during season, we'll typically have a tournament on the weekends. † So is there anything that you guys would like to say about Black Tide in general?  † AP: Well, I don't know if you know about the alumni network, but Black Tide was one of the earliest ultimate teams in the nation. We're tied for the most national championships and as far as connections go you get to meet alumni dating back to 1984, and even in Regionals, we met Tom Kennedy, the founder of Black Tide. † What sports tend to translate well into frisbee?  † BW: Well, I would say sports that test your agility, like football, soccer, so sports like that translate well into defense. Really, the biggest transition for freshmen is learning how to throw the frisbee and throw it with polish and precision. But then you also have guys like baseball players that have an advantage in terms of throwing, since their arms tend to start off a little bit better, so they might have an advantage to start. But sports like volleyball and basketball help too with verticality, and really a lot of different skill sets can work. † What types of positions are there in ultimate?  † BW: The most generic is the handler and the cutter, which if you break that down is similar to a quarterback and wide receiver, where the handler is touching the disc a lot. He has more polish with his throws, while a cutter, his main job is to catch the disc, whether that be with his verticality, something we call his radius of catchability, or just juking out the defender very often. So yeah, in very broad terms those two tend to be the general positions. † What would you guys tell people who were thinking about trying out next year?  † Arthur:† Well, I would say if you're unsure, just come out, because for most people, college ultimate is not what their image of it is like at first, whether they played in high school or not. Almost everyone I have talked to has said it's more competitive than they thought. † Bailey: Yeah, I would agree with that. College is all about finding your fit, your group of people. Our team is really diverse, and not just in the sense of diversity, ethnicity or culture, but in our majors, and it can just be more than frisbee. It's honestly a family. People have gotten jobs through Black Tide, because you really do meet so many different people and you form such deep connections. It really is like a family. † What do you guys think your best traditions are?  † AP: Well I would say one of our best are Black Tide Pride, and honestly, I love our jerseys. I think they're the best in regionals. We have really cool tie dye jerseys, and those date back to the very beginning of our program. † AK:I would say one that's been really important to me is BFTB, or ""úBlack Tide for the Boys.""ù Another great one is ""úBlack Tide Never Dies.""ù † BW: Oh, and a goofy one we sometimes say in games are ""úooze, gush, stick, crush.""ù I still don't know what that really means. † AK: Well, our team name refers back to the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara, so that's what the ooze gush part is referring back to, and the stick crush part is about sticky defense, and we want to crush the other team. † BW: So right before kickoff, one side will say ""úooze, gush,""ù and the other will say ""ústick, crush,""ù just to give that sense of unity, and really showing the people on the field that they have 14 teammates who have their back. † What's been the most memorable part of being on the team?  † AW: Well, at the end of my freshman year, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a 19-centimeter tumor in my left hip, and I had to do 11 months of chemo. So I went back home, and I was inpatient, which meant I was in the hospital every week. So for me, this team is always for the boys, and that means something to me. In my year off, I still had people driving down to L.A., since I was at UCLA, every few months to check up on me and hang out with me. So for someone who had to leave school for a while, it's really hard, because all of my friends from high school were at college, and all of my friends at college were obviously at college, so I was alone with my family, so it meant a lot to me to have people drive down. I was just a rookie at the time, and I still had seniors, I still had fifth-year seniors, sophomores, freshmen, just everyone wanted to check up on me. That was the reason [why] when I came back that it didn't matter the rehab I had to do, it didn't matter that I couldn't run the full length of the field without throwing up, because I knew I had to come back to this team. I hadn't met these people before, like Arthur and Bailey, but it didn't matter, because I was Black Tide. They were Black Tide, and that means that we're family. † After the interview with Black Tide, I'm starting to get why people on the team have such a feverish devotion. More than most clubs, the family bonds are really there, and they all seem to really enjoy each other. This was a great experience, and go Black Tide.

sports,Season in the Books: Gauchos Score Four Players on All-Big West Conference Teams,23-May-18,5:05 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-23/season-in-the-books-gauchos-score-four-players-on-all-big-west-conference-teams/,"The team watches intently as Alyssa Diaz swings at a pitch. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus As the 2017-2018 chapter of UCSB softball came to a close with a series win against Blue-Green rival Cal Poly, the Gauchos improved to a 20-win, 34-loss overall record to finish off the season in eighth place in the Big West Conference. Although the lackluster year brought more adversity than prosperity, UCSB scored a resounding four players who were named to All-Conference teams. Not only did the fantastic four receive recognition for an outstanding season, but each of them plans to return next year while 2 of which are merely culminating their freshman season. Junior second base clean-up hitter Sierra Altmeyer and sophomore first base facilitator Alyssa Diaz both received second team All-Big West honors, but this was not the first time either player has earned recognition of this caliber. Altmeyer earns her third honor as an all-league player as the veteran slapped .323 in her junior frame and hit 5 of her 8 team-leading bombs while comfortable in her own ballpark during games in Santa Barbara. She drove in 31 RBIs and was crucial during wins this season in which she hit .382. Her nearly 40% batting average over wins is a full ten percent higher than her .278 batting average during losses. Much of the success that Altmeyer had at the plate this year came on the back of fellow infielder Alyssa Diaz who hit in the three spot all year right in front of her complimentary second baseman. Pitchers struggled with Altmeyer in the clean-up because Diaz has such a staunch reputation for getting on base, thus giving Altmeyer so many opportunities to drive in runs. While the first baseman Diaz played in all but the final seven games of the season, she assumed a premier leadership role on the team in just her second year as she slashed .325 on the year and turned it on during conference play to improve her average to .357 against Big West foes. All five of Diaz's home runs came during the non-conference half of the season and nearly 78% of her RBIs were against out-of-conference competitors. Nonetheless, the second-year standout was named to the all-conference second team for the second consecutive year. Much like Diaz, we saw an influx of outstanding contact hitting from freshman infielder Maci Fines during conference play. The first year began her breakout season at third base but shifted over to the shortstop spot toward the end of the year as sophomore third baseman Kayla Krantz returned from an ankle injury. Fines was awarded All-Freshman team honors for the Big West Conference considering her all-star worthy .380 batting average during Big West competition in 2018. Fines ability to read the ball well lead her to the least number of strikeouts between active batters on the UCSB roster as she only got rung up 9 times this season. Her batting average and aggressiveness gradually increased as she became more comfortable at the plate in the latter half of the season. While Fines hit .231 and .217 respectively in the first of the season, she bettered her batting to .350 in April en route to shining from an outstanding performance in May in which she smacked .458 over a 6-game stretch. In fact, Fines took a six-game hitting streak into the final match against Cal Poly while four of those six games resulted in multi-hit contests for the first year. Last, but not least, freshman left fielder Sammy Fabian rounds off the list of Gauchos with All-Big West honors as she too earned a spot on the Freshman All-Conference team. Fabian was the sunshine on this team's season-long cloudy day that was unfortunately covered up by a plethora of other struggles going on with the Gauchos this year. Fabian began her career with UCSB this season batting .433 through the first 12 games. She led her fellow ""òChos in batting average for the majority of the season finishing with a team-high mark of .335 for the year. While the three other players that earned honors were the most appealing during Big West play, Fabian boasted early and dominated during non-conference play. The freshman flashed a .356 average to start off the year and notched her way up to fourth in the Big West in steals with 9. Yet, when it came to conference competition, Fabian wasn't nearly as effective. She walked less and struck out more, but what might have hindered her the most was the team's failure to give Fabian the green light on the base path. With the resounding speed and aggressiveness she displayed during the former half of the season, it was surprising how she didn't steal one single base during conference play. Worst of all though, Fabian was never given the chance on the base path during Big West play. She was signaled to steal zero times after an impeccable first half of her season she spent running all over catchers. With only three seniors graduating this year, the Gauchos plan to bring back virtually the whole team in the 2018-2019 season and get a taste of redemption after struggling to win only a third of their games this season.

sports,"""úMan Up""ù: Sports' Complex Role in Addressing Mental Health",24-May-18,5:10 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/man-up-sports-complex-role-in-addressing-mental-health/,"Peyton Stotelmyre/DAILY NEXUS One of the most often-used phrases in all levels of men's sports is ""úman up.""ù Whether it be a high school basketball player overcoming a rough shooting stretch or a college goalie fighting through an injury to stay in the game, the first lesson that young men are taught as athletes is that pain and sadness and discomfort are obstacles to overpower. To be a man in the world of sports is to shut out fear and uncertainty, to exude aggressiveness and passion and to limit doubt and over-thinking. To be a man is to win. Other than the archaic gendered connotations of the phrase, these lessons aren't necessarily bad on paper. Many coaches point to the application of what they teach even outside of sports as rationale for why athletes should listen. American society is theoretically organized to value self-confidence and hard work. There's supposed to be winners and losers, and if you believe in yourself and put in the work then you can achieve anything. We use Kobe Bryant's relentless perfectionism, LeBron James' refined diet and workouts and Michael Jordan's extreme work ethic as examples of those at the top getting to where they are by devotion and, more importantly, by choice. Of course they are successful; they chose to work hard to get there. Due to the innate link between economic success and happiness in the American consciousness, this ultimately comes to mean that they chose to be happy, and by extension anyone else with just some hard work and elbow grease can choose to be happy too. But what about the millions of people who don't always have the opportunities or resources or neurological capabilities to ""úchoose""ù to be happy ""î where do they fit in? The Toronto Raptors' perennial All-Star DeMar DeRozan made headlines recently because of an interview around this topic with the Toronto Star. ""úIt's one of them things that no matter how indestructible we look like we are, we're all human at the end of the day,""ù DeRozan explained. ""úWe all got feelings ""¶ all of that. Sometimes ""¶ it gets the best of you, there's times everything in the whole world's on top of you.""ù This interview came on the heels of a tweet which DeRozan sent out in February that simply read ""úThis depression get the best of me""¶""ù and sparked a national dialogue around how society stigmatizes and stifles mental health awareness among male athletes. Cavaliers forward Kevin Love expanded on this conversation in a piece he penned for the Players' Tribune, in which he pointed out that ""úThese values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they're everywhere . . . and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water.""ù There are two especially important points that DeRozan and Love made in their statements, and both offer solutions to deal with the issues surrounding mental health education. The first is that anyone at any time can be affected by some sort of mental illness, although it is important to note that there are very important outside factors (degree of illness, race, gender identity, economic status) which affect both the support for and impact of these problems. The second is that there is a very specific socialization of men, by men, that occurs in the United States, which manifests itself into toxic ideologies and actions for men ourselves and the communities we inhabit. It goes without saying that in order to start working on the issues of misrepresentation and miseducation when it comes to mental health, there has to be acknowledgment that there are problems in the first place. This is why it was important to hear not just an NBA player, but a Black NBA player, come out and address a topic like depression. Centuries of oppression, whether it be through the restriction of access to medical knowledge and care or the dehumanization and desensitization of Black and brown suffering, has created extreme stigma within communities of color surrounding mental health. Black Americans are more likely to undergo feelings of depression and worthlessness than white Americans, and yet, according to Mental Health America, have less access to treatment and actually utilize help at far lower rates. It would be far simpler to address these statistics if it was simply a matter of outward exclusion; however, internal attitudes ingrained over the years complicate accessibility as well. Because of historical precedents such as the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment or contemporary exclusion from groups such as the American Psychological Organization (of which Black Americans only make up 2 percent), there has been a cultural isolation of Black and brown communities from the medical community, which in turn has led to the solidification of negative and inaccurate ideologies. The characterization of mental illness as ""úweakness""ù or as in opposition to masculinity is very prevalent within these communities and has a tangible impact, such as the marginally higher attempted suicide rates among young Black boys compared to white children. By exposing his own fragility, DeRozan has helped counter this and start toward creating an atmosphere where Black and brown children are believed and supported. It is important to note, however, that it is men who have to take on most of the burden of unlearning and working toward less stigmatization of mental illness. As we have seen with recent mass school shootings, as well as the well-documented history of male violence in this country, our conception of masculinity or ""úmanhood""ù is just not healthy. Entitlement and over-confidence combined with a lack of empathy for others might work sometimes on the basketball court, but is a disastrous approach to relationships in other aspects of life. The truth is, for women and queer folks of color, most danger and abuse does not come from outside, but rather from straight men of color in their own communities. While all people of color have to deal with racism, stigma surrounding mental illness and lack of accessibility in other aspects of life, it is somehow acceptable to use violence against Black and brown women as an outlet for male frustration and inadequacy. This is a problem for all men, yet one would hope that having to deal with an intersection of other oppressions would give Black and brown men a better understanding of how not to channel their problems into ""úpunching down.""ù Only once we are able to protect those who are most vulnerable will we be able to attack the institutions or figures in power which are the crux of the problem. Ultimately, sports both reflect and create culture. Athletes such as DeRozan and Love speaking up about their own struggles with mental health mirrors a recent illumination of the topic in popular discourse; however, toxic ideals surrounding masculinity in sports have also been ingrained into American society for years. It is up to men to change how we talk and think about mental health, for our well-being and everyone else's safety.

sports,Heidegger Talks Overcoming Adversity On & Off The Court,24-May-18,5:05 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/heidegger-talks-overcoming-adversity-on-off-the-court/,"Max Heidegger reaches past the defense toward the hoop. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus When fans think of professional athletes, most tend to lean towards believing that these are people with great mental health. The reason is because these are people that reach the highest level of their individual field and something like that cannot be done without a strong sense of confidence, both internally and externally. However, as athletes are now reminding us today, that is not at all the case. As Kevin Love said, everyone is going through something.
And that is especially true at the collegiate level. College players are expected to juggle so much, whether it be their play on the court or their academics off of it. Like many, these transitions are tough, but they can be combated with experience and a continual growth mentally. Sophomore guard Max Heidegger has had an interesting start to his college career. This past season, Heidegger became the face of the UCSB men's basketball team becoming a breakout star who averaged a team-high 19.1 points per game on a very efficient 43 percent shooting and 40 percent from beyond the arc. The Malibu, California native was one of the key reasons for the Gauchos' historic turnaround, winning 23 games this year compared to winning six the previous season. The 23 wins also tied the program's best mark for wins in a single season. However, even he could attest that in a time of winning that the balance of everything never comes easy. ""úIt's hard in general, everyday. It's really tough balancing your time because obviously you want to relax a lot and hang out, but it's tough with school, obviously, and having your basketball obligations you have to do and then also you have to work on your game on your own,""ù Heidegger said. ""úBalancing everything and getting your time organized is really tough. For me personally, having other things to do that aren't basketball or school, other obligations, it gets really tough because I'm not free to do anything until six or seven, especially in season.""ù And yet, it hasn't been an easy ride for the sophomore. In his freshman campaign, Heidegger averaged just 7.6 points per game and shot 26.8 percent from the field and 20 percent from three-point range. Along with that, the former high school All-CIF player was battling injuries, something that has bothered him throughout his career.
""úIt was really tough on me personally. Right before the year I got hurt again, in high school I had a ton of injury problems so that was a little disheartening for me, but it was kind of after the season it came to a point where I could feel sorry for myself but I knew I had things I had to do to improve myself and so I went out there and did it. But it was for sure difficult during the season and after,""ù Heidegger said. A lot of times, we as fans take these things for granted. Heidegger has clearly transformed his game and it's easy to chalk it up to new coaching or schemes but, in reality, it was a lot of hard work both on and off the court. New Head Coach Joe Pasternack and his staff certainly played a huge role in the turnaround of the UCSB men's basketball program, but at the end of the day players are the ones who make the real difference come game time. In his first game this season, Heidegger was amazing. The sophomore led the Gauchos to a roaring 85-66 win over a talented North Dakota State squad in which he scored 33 points. Heidegger was definitely ready come game one, but not without a lot of hard work before that. ""úGoing into this past season I was a little anxious especially early on. Right before our first scrimmage I was anxious, because I hadn't played in a long time and I didn't play particularly how I wanted to so I was putting a lot of pressure on myself,""ù Heidegger said. ""úI was definitely anxious before this year but obviously it all worked out. I mean, it certainly wasn't easy, after last year. It was tough, it was tough on all of us. We all as a team, over summer, pulled ourselves up and pulled ourselves together.""ù Heidegger carried the momentum of that first game and parlayed it into a great season, one that was filled with many awards, smiles and most importantly, wins. This season was not perfect for the guard as he still struggled at times but, overall it was a much different experience. ""úObviously things are easy when things are good, shots are going in and you're winning games it's easy to be positive and it's easy to have confidence,""ù Heidegger said. ""úI had some games this year when I struggled but even still, playing well and having a great year, it's tough as a competitor to swallow that, to play bad and go back to the drawing board. I felt that from last year my freshman year helped me out a lot in terms of maturing and dealing with not everything going my way in college. It helped a lot with dealing with adversity.""ù
And even in a season where the Gauchos were winning games and having players like Max contribute at a high level there are always bumps that could get in the way. This year, UCSB dealt with two major incidents off the court and completely out of their control. The first being the Thomas Fire, a natural disaster that affected an entire community. ""úIt was super tough on all of us, mentally. One day we come back to Santa Barbara and then we evacuate. We don't know if we're going to play, when we're going to play. It's hard to focus on games when you have those outside factors. Especially because we're having to practice at high schools in Santa Barbara because our gym is smoked out. We walk in there and you can smell the fire and ash in the gym. Stuff like that was hard on us, staying in hotels in LA waiting for games,""ù Heidegger said. I knew it was tough on all of us, but that's when the team part came into play. We tried not to focus on it too much and just take it in strides, but looking back it was hard going place to place and not knowing what was happening. We thought we were in the clear and then with the mudslides we couldn't drive anywhere, it was a whole one thing after another. I knew for us it was obviously difficult but I knew it was difficult in the community as well but I know for our guys it was tough. We had a good enough support system between us and obviously our coaches to push through that,""ù Heidegger added. The second thing the Gauchos had to deal with was the Hawai'i bomb scare on the morning of January 13th. Thinking they were just going to play a game that night and nothing else, many of the UCSB athletes were still sleeping when people of Hawai'i were sent an emergency alert that a missile was headed for the country. ""úThat was a very weird and interesting experience. We tried not to think about it too much. Once it was over, for me personally, I brushed it off. I know a couple other players and all of us were a little bit shook still but we tried our best to shake it off, but it was super weird,""ù Heidegger said. ""úThe whole day seemed weird but we really wanted to get out of there. It was a very odd experience. We're sitting there in the morning thinking if this thing hits then that's a wrap for us.""ù Athletes do amazing things on their respective field of play, but they are not superhuman. And when sudden tragedies strike they too are affected. Heidegger is just one example of an athlete who has overcome plenty of adversity in just two years and you could chalk that up to a lot of things. The great thing about sports is the feeling of camaraderie and that's something that can't be replicated. ""úIt feels awesome to have guys that you can trust and talk to. At the end of the day a lot of those guys I'm still going to be talking to. It's a great feeling to have that camaraderie and friendship,""ù Heidegger said. ""úOnce I'm done playing that's probably going to be one of the parts I miss the most, being with my teammates and even just sitting in the locker room talking, hanging out. It's great to be part of the team.""ù At the end of the day, athletes are people too. They also need time away from what they love doing, they also need time to be with their friends and they also need to be weary of taking care of themselves mentally. It is easy for us to constantly come down on athletes after hard games. There were people who came down hard on Max after he only scored three points in a Gaucho loss to Long Beach State this season. But it's important to remember that, like us, athletes are people, and their struggles are something we should sympathize with, not belittle.

sports,The Boy's Club: Being a Woman in a Male-Dominated Sport,24-May-18,5:07 AM,['Hannah Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-24/the-boys-club-being-a-woman-in-a-male-dominated-sport/,"Natalia Spritzer/Daily Nexus I walked into my first karate class as a bright-eyed, ambitious first-grader who fancied herself a tomboy. I had expressed interest in playing football, but my parents had wanted me to take some form of self-defense classes and threw me into the United Studios of Self Defense ""î a mixture of Kung-fu and Shaolin Kempo Karate. Throughout the 10 years I spent doing martial arts, I saw many people from every walk of life come and go, but most of the concrete figures in the dojo were men. Being a young girl in a male-dominated sport certainly had its ups and downs. It could be incredibly disheartening to feel lesser than my peers simply because of our biological differences, but by that same notion, it was incredibly empowering to feel just as accomplished, if not more so, than the boys. It is really disorienting to be put on a pedestal for your gender when you're six years old. As a child I lacked the self-awareness to realize it, but ultimately it became clear as I grew older that every time I stepped into the dojo, I was representing my entire gender. Being a spokesperson for all women ""î specifically young women ""î was a huge burden to bear, and I constantly felt as though I had to prove myself in the name of my gender. Prior to my time in karate, I had only done activities that aligned with my gender, like ballet, gymnastics and an all-girls soccer league. But in this space I was an outlier, completely outnumbered by boys. Growing up in the dojo played an interesting role in the development of my mental health. Meditation played a big role in karate: Every class and private lesson started and ended with a moment of meditation. Mindfulness and a clear headspace were always preached, but at the same time, being in a male-dominated space had a big impact on my state of mind. Acting too much ""úlike a girl""ù was a disadvantage, and the effort to suppress the feminine aspects of my personality was both mentally and emotionally taxing. I hated crying in front of the boys, and ultimately I became too scared to do things that would leave me in a vulnerable position. After getting punched in the face at a tournament, I stopped fighting for about six months because I was afraid of getting caught off guard again, even though that's the nature of the sport. Karate has had a lasting effect on my mental state; I am hyper-vigilant of my surroundings ""î some could maybe say paranoid ""î and I still flinch when anyone comes close to my face. When I find myself in potentially dangerous situations I always try to strategize a way out. The most challenging aspect of being a woman in a male-centric sport was recognizing my limitations and differences from my opponents and trying to use that to my advantage. There were only three other girls in my age group during my 10 years of karate, all of whom quit before I earned my black belt. This gender disparity left the vast majority of my interactions, including sparring, with boys. Sparring is a form of fighting, often done with protective gear like helmets, gloves, shin guards and mouth guards. We would also practice open-hand fighting with no gear, called kumite. To say I got pummeled by men ""î both children and adults ""î would be an understatement. When I was 12, I was in the fifth hour of a seven-hour-long test and was paired up for a sparring match with a 20-something-year-old man who had an advantage of at least a full foot and 150 lbs. He did not take it easy on me, and the experience resulted in my first-ever panic attack. I will never forget how he yelled, ""úHit me! Hit me harder!""ù as his fists beat me over the head and his kicks jabbed me in the solar plexus. That being said, some of the most vicious and brutal fighters I have ever engaged in combat with have been women. The first fist ever to punch me in the face belonged to a very large eight-year-old who absolutely annihilated me in a tournament matchup. Some of the worst pain I have ever experienced came from a mom in her 40s named Liz who bent my finger backward so hard I thought she broke it. In my experience, I have found that men are often hesitant to exert their full force on a very small pre-teen. Almost every woman I have ever fought has seemingly shared the subconscious consensus that while we don't enjoy beating each other up, it is for our ultimate benefit and betterment as fighters. The necessity of taking self-defense classes became more glaringly obvious as I got older, and the emphasis on gender in the dojo became very apparent. The boys who did karate did it because they were hyperactive kids and they needed to learn discipline, or they wanted to learn to fight with swords and nunchucks. But for the very small female population ""î regardless of age ""î it was always about having the ability to defend ourselves should we ever be in a situation where it was necessary. From the age of 12 onwards, my sensei made a very big point of reminding me of all of the possibilities of violence against women that lurked beyond the walls of the dojo. The constant emphasis on violence against women, while it was important to recognize, became overkill in my mind. I was fed a narrative that made me believe that every stranger was out to cause me harm, and the message transitioned from one of caution to one of causation: ""úIf you do x, y, z, all of these horrible things could happen to you!""ù Going to karate became a chore because if I didn't learn to defend myself as adequately as I could, whatever could happen to me would feel like my fault, rather than the fault of someone potentially looking to cause me harm. While the environment of the dojo was conducive to physical strength and agility, it also conditioned a chronic pessimism and cynicism. When I earned my black belt at age 14, I became the first girl under 18 and the third woman in the history of my studio to achieve that feat. And while I may not be able to break a board with my bare hands or knock a man unconscious with a single punch, I put in just as much work, if not more, than any man. Despite the fact that I stopped doing karate, it is an enormous part of my identity for better and for worse. Even though there are no female Grandmasters as of right now, they are coming. It may not be me, but the next generation of girls who infiltrated the boy's club is growing up and they are kicking ass.

sports,"Warriors Vs. Cavs Part IV: Starters, X-Factors",31-May-18,5:10 AM,"['Jake Ciccone', 'Andrew Bishop']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-starters-x-factors/," X-Factors Jake Ciccone ANDRE IGUODALA:  Conversations about the Warriors are always dominated by talk of their four All-Stars, but their fifth man and final piece to their death lineup has been invaluable to their success as a team this year and in years past. Iguodala provides defensive versatility to the Warriors starting five, which allows them to throw different looks at LeBron James throughout the series, which could give him problems. However, Iguodala's veteran leadership might be the most important thing he adds to Golden State. He acts like a second coach on the floor by instructing players on where to go and calming everyone down when they start getting too loose with the ball. The versatility he provides is also apparent on offense, where he can play a point-forward role with the second unit or the starters, allowing the numerous great shooters on their squad to run off screens and find their shot. Iguodala has been ruled out for Game 1 and he will be reevaluated before Game 2, so the Warriors will have to make it work with Kevon Looney or Jordan Bell in his place for now. But if he is able to get back on the floor, even if he isn't fully healthy, his effect on his team cannot be understated. † KEVIN LOVE:  It's weird to say that an All-Star can be considered an X-Factor to his team, but Kevin Love has been up-and-down throughout the playoffs and he was injured for basically each of the last two games the Cavs played against Boston. Love is still in concussion protocol and his status for Game 1 is uncertain, but if he can get back on the floor and contribute, that opens up a lot of opportunities for his team. His best performances in the playoffs came against the Raptors, where he averaged 20.5 points for the series and was clearly playing his most confident basketball. More importantly, when Love was an offensive threat that commanded attention, the other role players on Cleveland were able to find their groove and start producing. If Love can channel his play from the Raptors series and stay healthy, he will take some of the load off of LeBron, and the Cavs might just be able to catch the Warriors off guard and give them a challenge. † Sizing Up Each Squad's Starting Line-Up Andrew Bishop † While both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors feature impressive depth amongst their bench players, this upcoming NBA Finals matchup will be centered around both teams' formidable starting lineups. Of the 10 players who will be on the court when the Finals kicks off this Wednesday, six made appearances in this year's all-star game, with the Cavaliers' LeBron James and the Warriors' Stephen Curry serving as captains of the East and West all-star teams respectively. While this will be the fourth consecutive finals meeting for the Warriors and the Cavs, the position matchups have changed significantly since last season. Let's break down each of the starting lineups and who they will be facing this year. † POINT GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE † Filling out the point guard position for the Cavs will be seasoned veteran George Hill, who is renowned for his three-point shooting abilities. Hill's shot has fallen off slightly since the start of the postseason, and he will likely have a tough time competing with the Warriors' Stephen Curry, one of the league's most heralded point guards and three-point shooters. Curry's ability to quickly come off screens and drain deep shots will likely put Hill in a tough spot throughout the series, and his PPG average throughout the postseason (24.8) dwarfs Hill's (9.7). † SHOOTING GUARD: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE † The two guard position will likely favor the Warriors as well, with all-star Klay Thompson facing the Cavs' veteran J.R. Smith. Like Hill, Smith makes his living behind the arc, leaving more room for LeBron James to do his thing. Smith has shot 36.8 percent on three point attempts this season, and he is known to catch fire when it counts, hitting multiple shots that helped the Cavs capture a Finals victory in 2016. However, Smith will be forced to contend with Klay Thompson, who has been hot this postseason, notching 20.5 PPG and shooting 42.6 percent from three. Thompson is one of the purest shooters in the league, and the Warriors' offensive system will likely get him multiple open looks, regardless of how hard J.R. plays up on him. While Thompson has a tendency to fall off in big games, if he's left open, he's practically automatic. † SMALL FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND † The small forward matchup will be the one to watch throughout the series. The Warriors will ante up with their star player, Kevin Durant, who has dominated the playoffs with his precise shooting, notching 29.0 [[ok]] PPG. Durant has proved to be a challenge to opponents on both sides of the ball, but he is slightly outmatched by his counterpart on the Cavaliers. LeBron James is arguably the best player of all time, and while Kevin Durant can sometimes hang with him, there is no way to completely shut him down. LeBron almost single-handedly carried the Cavs throughout the postseason, averaging an astonishing 34.0 PPG, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.8 assists. LeBron does it all, and if teams attempt to double him, he has other shooters on the perimeter to back him up. He is a force to be reckoned with, and he certainly has the upper hand in this matchup. † POWER FORWARD: FAVORS CLEVELAND † Both teams feature small forwards at the four position, with the Warriors starting Kevon Looney, and the Cavs starting Jeff Green in place of the injured Kevin Love. Looney has not done a whole lot during the playoffs, with about 4.5 PPG and 4.9 rebounds, and is mostly just filling in due to injuries. He will likely be outmatched by Green, whose point production helped LeBron get an edge over the Boston Celtics in the last two games of the Eastern Conference Finals. Green has averaged only about 8.3 PPG this postseason, but if he can turn it up during the Finals, he could prove to be even more of an asset to Cleveland. † CENTER: FAVORS GOLDEN STATE † Golden State and Cleveland fill their five spots with power forwards, operating under more of a ""úsmall ball""ù system. Cleveland's Tristan Thompson has not lived up to his extensive salary, especially during the playoffs, with a quiet 6.1 PPG and 6.1 rebounds. He will face off against the Warriors' all-star, Draymond Green, who has been nothing short of studly when it comes to crashing boards, notching 11.6 rebounds per game. Green averages about 11.1 PPG, and while his three point shot has fallen off since the Warriors' last finals appearance, he is still deadly from just about anywhere on the court.

sports,Warriors Vs. Cavs Part IV: The NBA and LeBron,31-May-18,5:09 AM,"['Max Kelton', 'Brandon Victor']",https://dailynexus.com/2018-05-31/warriors-vs-cavs-part-iv-the-nba-and-lebron/,"Peyton Stotelmyre Dynasties Come and Go, But Are Four Finals in a Row Too Many? Max Kelton † They call him the King, and who wouldn't? I mean, the man in question has reached the pinnacle of
competition in every season for the past eight years. LeBron James's jersey sales are impeccable and he
sets a precedent for every young baller. Not only is James's character one to look up to, but his work
ethic is that of a champion. LeBron himself, however, doesn't have the entertainment factor to support the entire NBA. What
shines from Jordan is the fact that during his six years competing in the NBA Finals, average viewership
was the highest it&#39;s ever been, barring the 1987 Lakers-Celtics, Magic-Bird, rivalry matchup. Yet the NBA was plagued after Jordan's final championship appearance. Come 1999, average
viewership slipped to just above 11 million after reaching nearly 19 million average viewers in 1998
following a steady rise in the recent five years. Since Jordan, average viewership in the NBA Finals
remains low, with the ceiling reaching 12 million viewers in 2001, 7 million less than the NBA's peak in
1998, the last time the G.O.A.T. competed. As LeBron's championship woes continued in Cleveland, following his first appearance in the Finals
which culminated in a devastating sweep in 2007, average viewership curbed to approximately 6 million
average viewers, the lowest it's been in over 40 years throughout the entire modern NBA era.
The King finally got a taste of a ring in Miami, a flavor he so longed for his hometown fans to indulge in.
Yet as he shifted gears back to Cleveland, a new duo of stars emerged in the West: cue the Splash
Brothers. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson brought significance to NBA level competition by reinventing the
game. Kids want to emulate Curry's shot. Players want to resemble the impact that the Splash Brothers
have on a game when they are healthy. LeBron displays superhuman athleticism and strength, but the
Warriors make it look relatable ""î they have fun playing this game. LeBron's jersey sales are impeccable
""¶ but Steph Curry's are off the charts. And it's no surprise that the top two teams in merchandise revenue are those two that have been in the
NBA Finals for each the past four seasons.
Over the past three years, the average viewership has reached its height since 2001. Fans love to see
a plethora of talent displayed in the championship games, but LeBron's team seems to lack the star
power that we've seen in the past. Similarly, over the past three years, average viewership has declined
from 2015. Viewership peaked when Steph and Klay shocked the world in 2015 by dropping the King. Followed by
a slight decline in viewership in 2016, Lebron and Kyrie bounced back and dropped the best record the
NBA had ever seen. 2017 brought Kevin Durant and suddenly the outcome became as predictable at the
start of the year as it was at the end as viewership once again dipped during the 5-game series. The NBA's motto is ""úWhere Amazing Happens,""ù but if the result is gradually and increasingly far from
mysterious, is the NBA really ""úamazing""ù anymore? † Can the One Man Army Win It All By Himself? Brandon Victor † What else is there to say about LeBron James that we haven't already heard? Despite thousands of minutes on his 33 year old body, despite all science suggesting he should be slowing down, the King continues to get better and more efficient, culminating in arguably the finest postseason of his career. Once again, LeBron James has defied all logic this postseason, carrying a team of washed up stars that likely would have gotten swept by the Pacers without him to the NBA finals. Through it all, LeBron has reminded us why he is the best player in the world. This postseason, despite shouldering a 36 percent usage rate, James has averaged 34 points, 8.8 assists, and 9.2 rebounds while still shooting a remarkable 54 percent from the field. With 13 double-doubles and 3 triple-doubles already this postseason, LeBron has solidified his name in the greatest of all time conversation. But can he do it all alone? Unless Kevin Love""ì who was a minus 18 in the Boston series""ì comes back from his concussion a brand-new player, he will once again be trying to drag this team of misfits and washed-up players past the finish line. And although LeBron displayed his greatness during the Boston series, he also seemed incredibly fatigued at times, missing rotations on the defensive end that he would never have missed in the past. LeBron will still get his buckets against Golden State, especially while Andre Iguodala remains sidelined. Despite the tenacious defense of Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, no player in the NBA can consistently guard LeBron James. While he may no longer have the explosiveness he used to, James has mastered his craft, using his strength to finish at the rim and then coming back and hitting a step-back on the very next play. Expect a vintage performance from the King this series""ì a player who has proven time and time again that he comes to play when the pressure is on. Similarly to 2015""ì when Kyrie Irving and Love both got injured""ì LeBron will do everything in his power to fight and claw his way for his fourth title. Unfortunately, just like in 2015, the best player in the world can't beat a team as deep and talented as the Warriors just by himself.

sports,Five Bold Predictions for the 2018 World Cup,6-Jun-18,10:40 AM,['Ryan Hykes'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-06/five-bold-predictions-for-the-2018-world-cup/,"Sky Sports In less than a month, the 2018 World Cup will kick off with a match between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. The world's most watched sporting event is missing usual contenders like Italy, Netherlands, and long-running qualifiers like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and the United States are also missing. In their place, underdogs like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia, the most Arab nations to qualify for a single World Cup. Panama and Iceland will make their first appearances in the Tournament, with Iceland being the smallest country to ever qualify with a population less than 350,000. With old contenders rebuilding around new stars, and the presence of some surprising teams, this year's World Cup might be the most unpredictable in some time. That won't stop The Daily Nexus though! Here are our 5 boldest predictions for the World Cup! Russia Will Not Make It Out of Group A Russia has a rich history of competitive soccer. They qualified for Brazil 2014 by winning their group outright over Portugal. They've reached as high as third on the FIFA Rankings in 1996 and their average position in the FIFA rankings, which has existed since 1993, is a very respectable 23rd. Add in the traditionally non-threatening presence of Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the host country's group, Russia would normally easily skate through to at least a second place showing, if not challenge Uruguay for the top spot. However, no points are awarded for tradition at the World Cup, and Russia will have to earn it's spot in the knockout stage with perhaps their worst team in history. The FIFA Rankings has Russia at its lowest spot in history this month at 66th. They have not won a single game this year and their best recent result was a tie with Spain, where they gave up three goals in St. Petersburg at the end of last year. To put it shortly, Russia is one of the few teams in the tournament that has been steadily trending downward over recent months. After Egypt's Mohamed Salah's record-breaking performance this year at Liverpool, the Pharaohs' one-man show should be enough against Russia's porous defense to advance Egypt past the host nation, who may become the second host team to not reach the knockout stage after South Africa in 2010. France Won't Get To The Knockout Stage France has been raved about in early previews of the World Cup as the deepest team in the tournament. You could even make a competitive squad from the French players, who did not get the invite to Russia. Led by Manchester United standout Paul Pogba, and a veteran captain in goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, France is deserving of its status as a contender this year. Just like they were in 2002 as defending champs or in 2010 as defending runner-ups, when they couldn't get past the group stage. France is obviously a favorite on paper, but some French media are worried about this version of the squad. ""úThis French team lacks character and mentality""ù, said Christophe Dugarry after a friendly loss to Colombia. Of perhaps all the major contenders, France may be the team most likely to surprise us all and flame-out in the group stage like they did in 2010. All 5 South American Teams Win Their Groups We've already touched on Uruguay's favorable Group A, but do not be surprised if the majority of the groups are won by South American squads. Argentina and Brazil are contenders to win the whole tournament, let alone their group. Colombia drew perhaps the most wide-open group with their only real roadblock being a one-man show in Robert Lewandowski's Poland and an underrated Senegal team. Still, Colombia, led by James Rodr√≠guez, the leading goalscorer at Brazil 2014, should be a slight favorite to top the group. While Peru will be making their first appearance since 1982, make no mistake they are not to be underestimated. The last time they lost a match was to Brazil in 2016! That's not a bad streak to bring into the Cup and they are easily one of the hottest teams entering the tournament. We've already seen France's penchant for struggling in the groups now and again and if Peru can take care of them, then Australia and Denmark shouldn't be any more challenging. Even with star Paolo Guerrero sidelined by a doping suspension, Jefferson Farf√°n and the rest of Peru's team will continue their hot streak and top Group C. 3 African Teams Make the Knockout Stage Setting a New Record We've already touched on a talented Egyptian squad led by Mohamed Salah, and an underrated Senegal who should only need to beat an unbalanced Polish team to take second in Group H. Nigeria is another squad that has a shot to make it through. They have a solid group, but have had goalkeeping issues with 19 year old Francis Uzoho the likely starter. If he can hold it together for them between the sticks, it possible they could beat out plucky Iceland and solid Croatia. Those three seem to be Africa's best shot of getting to the knockouts, but crazy things happen in the World Cup and maybe Tunisia or Morocco make some noise. Three squads in the knockouts would be an unprecedented result for African soccer, and while it is a bold prediction, don't be surprised to see Africa cement itself as the clear third best soccer region behind Europe and South America. A South American Team Will Win The World Cup Argentina and Brazil have always been huge soccer powers, but have been lacking in World Cup victories for a while now. Europe has won 3 straight an all-time record, including the first European win in South America with Germany's dominant run last year. On top of that, South America has not won a World Cup on European soil since Brazil's win in Sweden in 1958. Here's why it could change this year. Brazil is highly motivated after last years embarrassment against Germany in the semi-finals and they're dialed in after a recent 1-0 victory over the defending champs. Messi wants to cement his status as the greatest of all time and perhaps only a World Cup victory will bring that to him. After European dominance on the sport's biggest stage it's time stars like for Neymar, Messi, James, and Cavani to reestablish South America as the center of the soccer world. Brazil breaks through for another World Cup championship, while Argentina and Colombia do serious damage in this tournament.

sports,The Last Dance: Remembering the 1990 UCSB Basketball Team,13-Jun-18,2:08 PM,['Ryan Hykes'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-13/the-last-dance-remembering-the-1990-ucsb-basketball-team/,"Courtesy of Gauchohoops.com Before this year's tournament, 122 men's college basketball teams had appeared in the NCAA Tournament and never won, which comes out to around 40 percent of the national pool. Yet, thanks to the efforts of the 1990 squad, the Gauchos will always be part of the select group of winners at the tournament, something that conference rivals Fullerton, CSUN, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and Cal Poly cannot claim. It takes a truly special team, or at least exceptional luck to cross that boundary from loser to winner. This year, Marshall, Buffalo, and UMBC's shocking upsets removed themselves from that list of winless squads and those fan bases will always remember the day they became winners. While the Gauchos are in the midst of a seven year absence from the tournament, we will always remember the one time we were winners. It is March 15th, 1990. The venue: Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee. Seeded 9th in the Southeast Region, UCSB is led by the nation's second leading rebounder Eric ""úThe Freeze""ù McArthur at 13 per game and sharpshooter and fellow senior Carrick DeHart, who led the Gauchos in scoring at 15.9 PPG. Big man Junior Gary Gray, and sophomore wings Paul Johnson and Lucius Davis make the rest of the Gauchos core. All year they played an unselfish brand of basketball, relying on a suffocating defense and good rebounding, coached by Jerry Pimm. DeHart and McArthur nearly made it to the NBA with the Boston Celtics before playing careers that would take them all across the world. The team set on stopping the Gauchos from reaching their first tournament victory is the Houston Cougars, led by forward and eventual two-time NBA Champion Carl Herrera and only 6 years removed from the Phi Slama Jama-era teams that went to back-to-back championship games. Unlike this year's first time tournament winners, UCSB wasn't considered a heavy underdog heading into their game. Their seniors had NCAA tournament experience from two years prior and during the season, the Gauchos had given UNLV their last taste of defeat before the Runnin' Rebels would win the National Championship that year. UCSB had the potential to play with the best teams in the country, but inconsistency had plagued them all season with losses to mediocre Iowa and Pacific, twice. Hard fought throughout, the Gauchos topped the Houston Cougars on the strength of their defense and rebounding, their grind-it-out style a relic of an older era before 3 pointers reigned. In the first half, UCSB controlled the boards particularly well with 17 second chance points. The biggest highlight was a beautiful lob alley-oop dunk from Paul Johnson to Eric McArthur. Despite the advantage in rebounding and turnover differential, UCSB's poor shooting percentage led to the game being tied at halftime. After a long two pointer by Lucius Davis, a sophomore who in two years would achieve Big West Conference Player of the Year, UCSB led by single digits throughout the entire second half until a late run by Houston put the Cougars in the lead by a single point with a minute to go. The Gauchos would rely on what they had all season in order to pull out a victory. An air ball caught by McArthur and put back for an easy bucket put the Gauchos in the lead and after McArthur sunk a free throw on the next possession, the Gauchos led by 2 with 20 seconds left. As Houston tried to send the ball into the post for a score as time wound down, the Gauchos' heart and soul, Eric ""úThe Freeze""ù McArthur stole the ball. Just like that the game was over. McArthur would finish with a stuffed statsheet of 20 Points, 11 Rebounds, 5 Blocks and 4 Steals. Thanks to the near superhuman effort of McArthur and support from forward Gary Gray, who finished with 15 points and 9 rebounds, UCSB left the list of eternal losers at the NCAA tournament and joined the victors, a place their opponent had reached in 1961. The Gauchos greatest moment, immortalized in a grainy TV broadcast uploaded to YouTube with less than 1000 views, took place on a hideous orange court in Knoxville. ""úVOLS""ù surrounds the center court logo, a picture of the state of Tennessee. A small dark circle reading ""úNCAA""ù in the middle of the normal logo remained the only clue that this game meant more than a normal regular season tilt. To call the stadium half-empty would be optimistic. Still, 2,000 miles away from campus, as the clock wound down, the cheer of ""úGauchos! Gauchos!""ù rang through Thompson-Boling Arena.

sports,C Into the Future: What Lies Ahead for the Boston Celtics,21-Jun-18,7:10 PM,['Kendra Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-21/c-into-the-future-what-lies-ahead-for-the-boston-celtics/,"Rookie guard Jayson Tatum posterized a multitude of players this year, including the King himself. (Courtesy of Sporting News) It was the first game of the NBA season ""ì the Boston Celtics were slated to play against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Cleveland's home turf. Everyone had high hopes for Boston, as they just acquired two big all-stars in Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. But in the blink of an eye, about six minutes into the game, Hayward went down with a gruesome left leg injury that would require surgery and render him out of commission for the remainder of the season. After losing Hayward early in the season and later losing Kyrie Irving, who had surgery to remove prior placed screws in his left patella, the sports world was in awe of what happened next. Almost no one expected the Celtics to go as far as they did in the playoffs. Taking an explosive Milwaukee team to 7 games, beating a stacked Philly team in just 5, and taking LeBron James and his cradled Cavs to an eventful Eastern Conference Finals game 7. The Celts saw their season slip through their hands in the last few minutes of that game 7, when LeBron took over and the team couldn't hit a shot to save their lives. But despite coming up short in the 2017-2018 season, what lies ahead of this Boston team is perhaps a brighter future than any other franchise in the NBA. The Celtics will be legitimate title contenders for years to come, and here's why""¶ Not only do the Celtics have a General Manger mastermind in Danny Ainge (trading the number one pick to obtain Jayson Tatum and a subsequent first rounder?! Amazing!). But they also have the second coming of Greg Popovich in coach Brad Stevens, they're loaded with young talent, and since acquiring Hayward and Irving, they are no doubt an enticing location for any free agent serious about winning some hardware. In order to fully understand the firepower of Boston, it is quintessential to look at the antecedent state of their roster in which they ended their season, understand just what the Celtics have to look forward to in their future draft picks, and take note of what they will look like come training camp when No.11 and No. 20 suit-up once again. In terms of their draft picks, let's take a look at what the Green Machine has in their arsenal: It is clear that the Celts have more than a couple draft picks up their sleeve. It cannot be ignored though, that draft picks are only as good as the players the franchise chooses to pick up. But given Boston's track record of successful drafting, that doesn't seem to be something the C's are too worried about. Boston's current roster impressed many, by getting within one game of the NBA Finals without their two all-stars. Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Jayson Tatum, and their coach Brad Stevens, are just a few reasons why. You would have been a fool to think an offensive powerhouse like Tatum would've been anything less than effective this past season. After all, he did come from Duke. However, not many foresaw him developing as much as he did as fast as he did. With Hayward going down, it forced Tatum to step up and grow into the force he is inevitably becoming before our very eyes. He effectively plays both ends of the court, and even got a highlight-worthy dunk on LeBron James late in his rookie season. 20-year old Tatum may not be able to get into a bar just yet, but he's already got into the hearts of every Celtic fan around the world. Tatum is just a piece of the puzzle that makes up the future of the C's franchise. Boston is extremely versatile, and their roster is loaded with pieces that just ""úfit""ù. You've got players from the veteran Al Horford, who is a critical piece of the Celtics' frontcourt and leadership, to the young and explosive dunk-machine Jaylen Brown who is also a force on defense. You'd be remiss not to consider Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes, Marcus Smart, and the other competitors that played a big role in the Celts' great playoff run. But you can contend that a few of those pieces are somewhat disposable if you're owner Wyc Grousbeck and GM Danny Ainge and are looking to acquire other players. Rumor has it that the Celtics may be considering trading Brown and some picks to move up in the draft to gain a shot at big Center Mo Bamba from the University of Texas. But if you know anything about Ainge, these rumors can possibly prove to be nothing but smoke and mirrors, especially since the C's didn't trade down in the draft last year until the very last possible second and shocked the world by trading for the third overall pick. Brad Stevens has a coaching system that mimics the great Bill Belichick's, and that became abundantly evident this past season. The ""únext man up""ù approach the Celtics have adapted is similar to what the New England Patriots refer to as ""úDo Your Job""ù, meaning that every player on the roster needs to be ready to come to play, no matter the game or the week. Stevens was such a big influence and genius play-caller with the young injury-induced roster he had this past season, so one can only imagine what his greatness can achieve in several years to come with a fully healthy roster. Looking at the final minutes of the ECF game 7, and the struggles Boston had scoring, it is evident that Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward are much needed and will have a huge impact once healthy and can push this already good team to become a great one. One can't know for sure, but if those two all-stars were on the roster, some say we would have been watching a very different NBA Finals right now instead of watching Steph Curry and Klay Thompson run circles around JR Smith and Tristan Kardashian (I had to). When you consider the current pieces they have, the pending state of the team when Hayward and Irving come back, and the vast amount of picks the Celts have at their disposal, you can easily proclaim that Boston clearly has the best ""úprocess""ù around. And that process didn't even involve tanking (looking at you, Philly). With LeBron's future in Cleveland hanging in the balance, you could attest that Boston and Philadelphia might be the best two teams in the East starting next season. But even if LeBron does stay in the East, he definitely won't have an automatic bid to the Finals like he's had these past 8 years. These ain't your mommas Boston Celtics, folks. This team is for real. The Celtics are set up to win for years to come. Who knows? They may even win not 1""¶ not 2""¶ not 3""¶ not 4""¶ not 5""¶ On second thought, the last person to make that prognostication ended up getting that amount of NBA Finals losses instead of titles. Boston has a bright future ahead of them, they can let their upcoming success speak for itself.

sports,How ESPN Ruined The 2018 NBA Draft,22-Jun-18,7:59 PM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-22/how-espn-ruined-the-2018-nba-draft/,"no copyright infringement is intended I know what you're thinking: they do this every year. But ESPN's presentation of the 2018 NBA draft stood out from their previous blunders in ways that left me wondering how anyone else was taking in the barrel of chum that was this year's coverage. A few looks at social media confirmed that I'm not crazy (take that, my therapist), and also not the only one to cringe at every forced player comparison made and blatantly-misguided interview question asked. It's unfortunate that any draft day should warrant this kind of criticism because, after all, it should be about the players selected, a majority of whom are younger than half of UCSB's undergrads. In fact, 11 of 14 players selected in this year's lottery are 19 or younger. ESPN should not only highlight these newcomers but should provide insightful basketball analysis, instead of reality-TV content.  Any analysis, especially insightful, is a stretch for today's ESPN, but some of last night's commentary was simply disappointing. The top prospects of this year have been talked about for months now, so there was a real opportunity presented for the network to capture the long-awaited selections with a dialogue pointing to the next step for the draftees and their respective franchises. Instead, the well-known highlights of each player were reiterated with little acknowledgement of where the players were headed. It doesn't take the notion of draft night to once again explain Deandre Ayton's athleticism, or Luka Doncic's success overseas. On draft night, it should be about what's next for them in the league.  In the immediate moments following the announced destination of each prospect, the chance to talk NBA basketball was missed. In the case of Ayton, a player expected to go No. 1 in the draft for quite a while, his destination was only touched upon. The Suns have exceptional young talent to welcome Ayton; however, the brief mention of Ayton's future teammates was underwhelming and hardly informative. Perhaps the aspect of time between picks hampored any detailed analysis, so maybe the section of the show devoted to player introductions should've been a time for actual NBA commentary.  Player introductions, which were done for the first (and hopefully last) time in draft history last night, should've been the first sign of botched coverage. Most of the expected lottery picks were featured walking down the stage with family members or friends alongside them, which is great for celebrating the players, except every player already gets plenty of camera time once the actual draft begins. Players are shown, oftentimes with their friends and family, awaiting picks at their tables, on stage with commissioner Adam Silver, being interviewed after they're picked, and the abundance of media obligations awaiting them after their interviews. Why would the players need even more screen-time? Because the ESPN commentators actually have that little of importance to say.   Beginning with Chauncey Billups, who earned my respect as a player during his Detroit years, Billups' segment of player comparisons was terrible and frankly a waste of time. It's understandable why comparing young draft picks to past and present NBA players is helpful in characterizing a players' potential, but some comparisons appeared forced and few were reasonable. Aside from the weird trend of matching the race of pick and compared player, Billups failed to match playstyles altogether.  Jaren Jackson Jr., selected fourth, was compared to Joakim Noah. As Billups made this comparison, Jackson Jr.'s highlights were shown with him spreading the floor and hitting threes. Joakim Noah, as anyone who's watched him play should know, isn't a big three point shooter, or shooter in general. Noah has an NBA career three point percentage of 0.00. Billups had to have done some preparation for the top prospects and their comparisons, and obviously it's uncertain how every draftee will turn out, but some of his choices made it seem like he was drawing names out of segregated hats.  If the racially-aligned player comparisons weren't awkward enough, the post-draft interviews for each player picked up the slack. After being picked, shaking the commissioners' hand and walking across the stage, the players then faced a barrage of poor interview questions. Simply pointless questions regarding ""úthe moment""ù and ""úwhat their team can expect""ù were repeated for each pick, with equally repetitive answers. How else are they supposed to feel? They just got drafted by an NBA team as a teenager, we're sure that's awful. And immediately after being drafted they had to sell themselves as a player again? It was ridiculous and a blatant move by ESPN trying to generate drama. Standing out among the interviews was Colin Sexton's. Following his selection at 8th overall by Cleveland, Sexton was coaxed by the interviewer to make a pitch for LeBron to stay. Talk about awkward. Anything the Cavs do to retain The King will likely include packaging their newest draft pick in a trade for another star, just like they did with Andrew Wiggins in 2014. As if Sexton was supposed to say, ""òLeBron please stay, I promise I'll know the score during the final seconds of a playoff game.""ù On top of it all, ESPN reporter and columnist Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted out virtually every pick before it happened, which only cheapens the draft coverage itself even further. Maybe my sports expectations are too high for a Disney-owned company, and maybe the point of the show is to be just that, a show. But, the difficulty of finding non-conglomerate, real-time draft news should indicate where the dominating national sports coverage is heading. If the NBA draft is developing into a reality show, how soon until other ESPN/ABC (both Disney) NBA events like All-Star Weekend and End of Year Awards are ruined? Oh wait.

sports,"The 71 Year Old Man With the Cane, Ronaldo/Messi's Fall, and the New Hero",30-Jun-18,7:29 PM,['Omeed Soltanalipour'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-06-30/the-71-year-old-man-with-the-cane-ronaldo-messis-fall-and-the-new-hero/," Today marks the last day of the month and the start of the round of 16. Two very important matches occurred earlier today. Early in the morning, Argentina and France faced off, later in the day, Portugal and Uruguay played. Never have I seen such exciting games at this stage of the competition. I will breakdown the first match played at 7:00 A.M. first. France came in with high hopes for this tournament. Not only do they have an excellent lineup of talented players, but they also have a few familiar faces with more experience and growth. Griezmann, Pogba, and Giroud all performed exceptionally well this world cup. There is one star who has just made it to the limelight however. His performance will probably go on in history, for decades to come. ""ãThat man is Kylian Mbapp√© Lottin. Born in Bondy, just shy of 19 years ago, Mbapp√© has risen to the ranks of the young Ronaldo. Early in the game, a quick sprint by Mbapp√© propelled him past the Argentinian defense into the penalty box where he was fouled. This gave the French their first opportunity as they received a penalty kick. Griezmann shot it and delivered! Then, the unthinkable happened. Right near the end of the first half, Di Maria hit it right in the net. The game was all tied up 1-1 heading to the break. Right near the start of the second half. Mercado deflects a shot by Messi and hits it in. Now, the French are on the verge of elimination! 57th minute, the French respond right back tying it up at 2 goals each. The game continues on until the return of Mbapp√©, who scores another goal for the French side bringing them up 3-2. Just minutes later, Mbapp√© comes in again and scores for France. Near the last minutes of the match, desperate Argentinian sides do whatever it takes to catch up. The 93rd minutes sees Sergio Ag√ºero hit it in. Unfortunately, this wasn't enough for them. Messi and company will go home tonight. France will move on to face either Uruguay or Portugal. It is great to be a football player; you get to really live a great life. Not to mention the amount of money you make. Mbapp√© however, does not seem too motivated by the money. The man, who scored two goals for the French, wants to donate all of his FIFA earnings to charity. What a great guy! Just a few hours later, Uruguay, led by the 71 year old √ìscar Tab√°rez faced off against Portugal lead by, well, Ronaldo maybe? Uruguay delivered an incredible performance ousting the Portuguese. Early in the first half, Cavani, assisted by Su√°rez, shot it in. In the 55th minute, Pepe for Portugal responded tying this game up 1-1. This ended Uruguay's run of 597 minutes of not conceding a goal. Pretty amazing, if you ask me! Then, in the 62nd minute, Cavani scores again for the Uruguayan side. Portugal tried very hard to make something happen, but block after block shut them down. Uruguay took this one by their teeth. It could not have happened without their head coach however. Tab√°rez, pictured below, suffers from a rare degenerative disease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome. It mainly affects the limbs and causes numbness and weakness. Through it all, he decided to fight through and help his team move forward. The 71 year old is nicknamed ""òEl Maestro' (The Teacher) since he used to work at a school.  At the end of today, two teams are through. France and Uruguay will be facing off next week on Friday at 7 A.M PST. This one will be quite the thrill. I think it will be very close, but France will have the edge. Looks like Messi and Ronaldo won't be meeting for a match this world cup. Yet, they will still be meeting at the airport on the way back! Tomorrow we will see the World Cup hosts face off against 2010 World Cup champions. Later in the day, a powerful Croatia will face off against Denmark, who tied against France. I think Croatia and Spain will come out victorious. Stay tuned for more updates!

sports,NBA Draft Superlatives,1-Jul-18,1:45 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-01/nba-draft-superlatives/,"Image used from NBC Sports, Getty Images. No copyright infringement intended. The NBA Draft is already far in the rearview mirror and summer league and free agency are at the forefront of every NBA fan's focus. Soon enough next season will be here, and a new class of rookies will be eager to take the league by storm. This draft class has been labeled as loaded from the lottery to the second round and it will be fascinating to see if it lives up to the hype. Here are my thoughts on some of the draft's important selections and storylines. Rookie of the Year: Marvin Bagley Even with the number two pick in the draft this year, the Kings will still probably find themselves near the bottom of the western conference standings again while they continue to develop their young talent. With that being said, Marvin Bagley will surely be looked to as the Kings go-to scorer and he'll have many opportunities to put up big numbers. The Kings will be facing no pressure to win games this season which will allow Bagley to play freely and take his lumps while adjusting to the NBA game. With a brand new focal point of their offense, the Kings will hopefully begin to develop some sort of identity moving forward with their collection of promising young players. If Bagley took home Rookie of the Year honors that would be a step in the right direction for their franchise. Runner Up: Luka Doncic Doncic's stats will most likely be less impressive than Bagley's, but if he and the Mavs are able to improve enough to squeak into the playoffs, his efforts just might be rewarded handsomely. Best Value Pick: Robert Williams Robert Williams, out of Texas A&M, was projected by some to go as high as the late lottery due to his size and athleticism but concerns about his work ethic and off-court problems caused him to fall into the late first round on draft night. So, when the Celtics swiped him up at 27 it was considered a steal and a low-risk pick for that late in the round. Williams is potentially a great fit for Boston, a team that has proven to be great defensively and could easily insert him into a backup center role behind Al Horford. They have enough offensive tools that he will only have to worry about playing defense, running the floor, and catching lobs, all of which he currently excels at. Coach Brad Stevens has been noted for his ability to work with headcases and turn them into productive players, and he will more than likely turn the physical tools of Williams into production for Boston. Runner Up: Michael Porter Jr. His injuries are a massive question mark, but if Porter can live up to his potential, he could prove to be the piece that launches Denver from fringe-playoff team to contender. Riskiest Pick: Trae Young Trae Young undoubtedly put up a historic season last year at Oklahoma, leading the county in both points and assists as a freshman. This being said, he did struggle in the latter half of the season when teams game-planned for him and took him out of his rhythm. Young is small in stature and it is possible that he struggles initially with the physicality of the NBA. Also, the fact that the Hawks had Luka Doncic and swapped him for Young on draft night puts some added pressure on him. Hawks fans better hope that Young lives up to expectations because if Doncic shines and Young disappoints, that draft night trade will haunt their franchise forever. Runner up: Mo Bamba Orlando currently lacks any promising playmakers on offense so adding another defensive big with players like Collin Sexton and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander left on the board could prove costly going into the future. Best Second Round Pick: Keita Bates Diop Bates-Diop was projected to go as high as mid-first round in many mock drafts, so it was very surprising when Minnesota was able to scoop him up with the 48th pick. KBD has all of the tools to be an effective NBA player such as defensive length, shooting ability, and experience from four years of college ball. This is an extremely low-risk pick for the T Wolves this late in the draft because he has the ability to come in and contribute right away for a team looking to return to the playoffs. Bates-Diop could also serve as a possible Andrew Wiggins replacement if the Wolves go in and seek out a deal to unload the massive contract of Wiggins, who many say does not have a good relationship with the Minnesota front office. Runner Up: Jevon Carter The Grizzlies roster last year was a nightly who's-who of former G-League and overseas players, so Carter is likely to get a decent number of minutes backing up Mike Conley.† Plus, I could not think of a better player to fit in with Memphis's ""úGrit and Grind""ù style of play than the defensive-minded Carter. Best under the radar pick: Omari Spellman Omari Spellman is probably not a well-known name to casual basketball fans because he was overshadowed by his great teammates at Villanova last year. Recognition aside, Spellman is built out of a Draymond Green-type mold and could find success early on in his career because of this. He is a proven rebounder and defender with the skill to knock down the three-ball at an efficient clip (43% in college). He does the little things on both ends by hustling and making the high-IQ plays to put his team in the best position to win. There is a place on every roster for a guy who can shoot and defend, and Spellman is in a great position to contribute for Atlanta. Runner Up: Lonnie Walker Walker is a versatile guard who shows promise as a scorer and defender and should pair well with future backcourt mate Dejounte Murray in San Antonio.

sports,"World Cup 2018: High Expectations, Unpredictability, and Triumph",15-Jul-18,5:37 PM,['Omeed Soltanalipour'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-07-15/world-cup-2018-high-expectations-unpredictability-and-triumph/,"Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images I can't believe the world cup has come to an end! I must admit, this world cup felt somewhat short. I made a post about why we feel certain events happen faster than others, check it out here: https://omsol.weebly.com/blog/special-edition-time-perception-and-why-time-flies. This world cup was marked by high expectations for teams that were predicted to do well but ended up falling short. Take Germany for example; just because they won the previous world cup, everyone thought they would take it again. The high expectations people had led to disappointment. That is why I always say, ""úNever have high expectations""ù, it usually leads to disappointment. This world cup saw a lot of underdogs, or seemingly ""úweaker""ù teams go far. Russia for example, made it all the way to the quarter-finals and would have made it further if it wasn't for the final goal by Croatia during the penalty kicks. Croatia is probably the biggest underdog in this whole competition. An Eastern European nation, formerly part of Yugoslavia, Croatia fought hard and placed second in the competition, a feat that is quite amazing for a† nation that is tiny even compared to the rest of the European world. The match between two former rivals, Croatia and France, began earlier today. France played exceptionally well from the start. Croatia however, had the upper hand in terms of possession. These two teams battled each other back in 1998 in the semi-finals. France came out victorious and ended up winning the whole tournament after defeating Brazil 3-0. The French team did repeat history. They are the only team to have won two world cups in the span of last two decades. This shows what potential the team has and how it has really made its mark. The game went on to a win for France 4-2. It was amazing! The players gathered together to celebrate their win, when all of a sudden, it started raining like crazy.† I guess this was an added bonus. The soaked players were in awe and happiness as they could now say they were the best in the world. Interestingly, many of the French soccer player's parents came from other countries and immigrated to France for new opportunities. They come to France and lived in the poor area of Paris. They trained these players in training camps and eventually picked out the best of the best. This system is most prevalent in France, which is the reason that France creates the most world cup players. Many of the French players go on to play for other teams like Morocco, Portugal and Ivory Coast for example. This demonstrates the importance of immigration and the use of immigration to help create opportunity and progress. This world cup was very entertaining. In my opinion, this was one of the best world cups ever, if not the best in my lifetime. There was a lot of unpredictability and excitement which made it great. I hope you all enjoyed it and I will see you in Qatar!

sports,Gauchos Offense Shines in Exhibition Opener Against Westmont,13-Aug-18,12:32 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-13/gauchos-offense-shines-in-exhibition-opener-against-westmont/,"Nexus File Photo Since the 2014 season, the UCSB women's soccer team has begun its season the same way: an exhibition match against Westmont College. Much like the past few years, the Gauchos defeated the Warriors but Saturday's victory might have been the most dominant of them all. UCSB took down Westmont by a final tally of 5-1 thanks to a strong first-half performance that saw the Gauchos score four goals to the Warriors one. Additionally, Santa Barbara outshot Westmont 14-3 in the first half and 19-3 for the entire contest. Of the 19 total shots the Gauchos took Saturday, 14 of them were on goal, a solid number for any match. Leading the way in the first half was junior forward/midfielder Shaelan Murison who started off the scoring in the 11th minute when she controlled a cross with a nice chest trap and then fired in a goal off the right crossbar. The assist was credited to newcomer†Katherine Sheehy, a junior transfer from SBCC. Three minutes later the Gauchos would tally another goal when senior Madeline Gibson snuck one past the goalkeeper. Murison and sophomore Christine Maurer earned the assist on the play. Westmont would retaliate in the 39th minute when junior Maddi Berthoud scored the only goal for the Warriors on Saturday. Berthoud took all three shots Westmont registered in the match which comes as a surprise to no one as she was led the team in assists and was tied in goals with 11. It wouldn't take long for UCSB to get the lead back up to two, however, as Sheehy knocked in her first goal as a Gaucho with a header that knocked off the left post. It was certainly a great night for the forward transfer in her first night representing the blue and yellow as she had a game-high two assists to go along with her lone goal. Head Coach Paul Stumpf praised Sheehy and her quality play throughout summer practice and it certainly showed why in this exhibition. Following Sheehy's goal, the person who began the scoring, Murison, would help give the team an even bigger advantage at the conclusion of the first half knocking in another goal in the 44th minute. Santa Barbara would score one more in the contest in the as midfielder Sydney Magnin knocked in a free kick from 25 yards out. Overall, Saturday went about as perfectly as it could for the Gauchos as not only did they put on a show on offense, something the team had their struggles with last season, but they also were able to get everyone playing time as every single active person on the roster logged some action. UCSB has a lot of questions to answer this season. With the loss of Amanda Ball who scored 20 of the teams 53 goals over the past two seasons, it would be interesting to see who would step up and lead the team this year. While Saturday night might not have shown one standout player it did show a collective group of women working well together and that could be just the thing to revitalize a program that has missed the conference tournament the last two seasons. UCSB will kick off its season against Sac State at 4 p.m. Friday, August 17th at Peter Johann Field in Las Vegas, Nevada.

sports,Gauchos Shut Out Westmont 7-0 in Promising Exhibition Opener,19-Aug-18,12:45 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-19/gauchos-shut-out-westmont-7-0-in-promising-exhibition-opener/,"Rodney Michael steals the ball from the opposition. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus One year ago, the UCSB men's soccer team was upset by Westmont College 2-1 in their annual exhibition game""ì a shocking result that gave the Warriors their first win over the Gauchos since 2000, in addition to foreshadowing a down year for Santa Barbara. On Saturday, Coach Tim Vom Steeg and the Gauchos returned the favor in style, dominating Westmont in all facets of the game en route to a 7-0 blowout victory. While just an exhibition game, UCSB seamlessly integrated the new members of the squad with its returning players. At the back, Junior transfer Faouzi Taieb""ìwho earlier in the year became only the eighth Gaucho to be on the prestigious MAC Hermann trophy watch list""ìdemonstrated his poise and leadership at center back, making several key tackles and holding the Warriors to only two shots on goal in the entire game. Despite the absence of Sophomore transfer Carson Vom Steeg, who picked up a knock in training, the rest of the backline easily nullified the Westmont attack and helped the Gauchos maintain a clean sheet. Sophomore transfer Hunter Ashworth smoothy moved into his role alongside Senior Jan Ilskens and Sophomore Adrian Adames, and the four at the back displayed a remarkable amount of chemistry considering their lack of playing time together. Perhaps most important for the Gauchos was the spark they showed on the attacking end of the pitch""ì a spark that was too often missing last season, when UCSB only scored 18 goals in 19 matches. Sophomore Rodney Michael once again proved why he was named the Big West Freshman of the year last season, creating havoc on the right side with his pace from the get-go. After leading the Gauchos with four assists last year, Michael picked up right where he left off, assisting on both of the first two goals for Santa Barbara. A positive sign for Santa Barbara going forward was the obvious connection between Michael, Junior Ignacio Tellechea, and Junior transfer Thibault Candia. Tellechea and Candia both led the Gauchos with four shots, as well as two goals a piece. Despite most of their goals occuring in the six yard box, the positioning of the forwards and their composure in the box suggest that UCSB will pose much more of a threat to opposing defenses this season. Even off of the bench, Freshman Carter Clemmensen""ì a highly touted recruit from Arizona""ì showed why he was named the Arizona Gatorade player of the year, rounding a defender and the ""òkeeper in the 30th minute before dishing off to a wide open Candia. Less than two minutes later, Candia returned the favor, taking advantage of a giveaway from Westmont before finding Clemmensen for his first ever goal in blue and gold. Another great sign for Vom Steeg going forward was the performance from Senior Axel Mendez, an attacking midfielder who won Big West Freshman of the Year in 2014 before leaving the team for the past couple of seasons. In his triumphant return on Saturday, Mendez did not disappoint, consistently beating defenders off of the dribble and tallying a goal for his troubles. Perhaps the only disappointment on the night for the Gauchos was that very strength on defense. Neither Freshman Goalie Ben Roach or returning Sophomore Alan Carrillo were forced to make any difficult saves on the night, leaving the depth chart murky heading into the first regular season match later this week. The two have been in a heated battle all summer for the starting position, and despite Roach drawing the nominal start, it seems the starter will be decided based on practice this week. While the Gauchos have many positives to take away""ìincluding the Bryant and Sons trophy""ì Santa Barbara will face much stiffer competition when the Gauchos open up regular season play against St. John's on Friday. The Red Storm have already picked up two results against teams in the top 25 this preseason, and will prove a formidable challenge to a Gaucho team that has legitimate Big West title aspirations this season.

sports,Gauchos Breathe Life Into Thunderdome,24-Aug-18,4:16 PM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/gauchos-breathe-life-into-thunderdome/,"After bringing the ball back in play, Max Heidegger moves up the court. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus One year ago at this time, newly appointed Head Coach Joe Pasternack was in the midst of summer, tasked with turning around a team that finished its previous season with only six wins. It took only eight games into Pasternack's first season for the team to notch the same win total, but that was just the beginning.  Now, one summer later, the Gauchos are looking to build off their refreshing 23-9 season that saw the breakout performance of guard Max Heidegger and a revitalization of the Thunderdome. Now, this year, UCSB men's basketball is back knowing what the team is capable of under Pasternack's system.  ""úWe talk a lot about honoring the process,""ù explained Pasternack, ""úand that's really what this program is about: honoring the process each day and the results will take care of themselves.""ù The results were certainly taken care of, with the team tying a UCSB record with 23 wins and narrowly falling short in the Big West Tournament.  Crucial to the Gauchos' success last season was now-junior Max Heidegger, who led UCSB with 19.1 points per game, and senior transfer Leland King II. While King II, who averaged a double-double of 15.6 points and 10.2 boards per contest, won't be on the court with the Gauchos this season, his production demonstrates the immediate impact that recruited transfers can have for a team.  This will be especially important for UCSB. Despite losing four senior starters and seven seniors in total, Pasternack has brought in another talented class of recruits, highlighted by game-ready transfers capable of keeping Santa Barbara's momentum alive. ""úWe had the biggest turnaround in NCAA history last year from six wins to 23 wins, and a big part of that is the students,""ù Pasternack continued. ""úWhen I first got here April 4, 2017, I said I wanted to build this program where everyone in the community of Santa Barbara and, most importantly, the students would make this their home court advantage.""ù Heidegger's lights-out shooting will surely bring fans to their feet again this season, filling the Thunderdome with new life. Home court advantage was real for the Gauchos last season, as they won 11 straight at the Thunderdome to start the season and ended 12-2.  Coach Pasternack hopes to see the same kind of energy at home this season and will likely be putting together more enticing giveaways closer to the start of the regular season.  ""úTowards the end of the year, whether it was Irvine at home or the last game of the year, specifically Cal Poly, there was nothing like it; the energy and excitement in the Thunderdome was unbelievable. It was definitely a sixth man for us and I can't tell you how important that is for our players to have the Thunderdome packed every night no matter who we're playing. For our program, that's our goal: to fill the Thunderdome each night,""ù said Pasternack.  There's no substitute for a packed Thunderdome when the Gauchos hit a three in transition, so it says a lot for Pasternack and his staff to be so invested in the students and fans.  While another 17-win jump is simply impossible, the culture of the Thunderdome is back. And with momentum from last year's success, the Gauchos are prepared for another remarkable season.

sports,Gauchos Head Into Season with Redemption on the Mind,24-Aug-18,4:24 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/83891/," At the press conference following the UCSB men's soccer team's shocking defeat against UC Riverside last season, a visibly irritated Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg had vowed that, no matter what, the team would come back stronger next season and that they would use that feeling of anguish and uselessness as extra motivation in the seven months to come. Following their 7-0 dismantling of Westmont Aug. 18, it would be difficult to argue with Vom Steeg's assertion. This year's Gauchos, picked to finish second in the Big West behind only Cal State Fullerton, look poised to bounce back strong from last season's disappointment due to several key new acquisitions as well as nine returning starters from last season's team. Last year, Santa Barbara was shackled by its lack of finesse in the final third, scoring only 18 goals in 19 games. In an effort to bolster the attack, UCSB acquired junior transfer Thibault Candia, a pacey striker who led Temple last season with six goals. Candia already looked to be in mid-season form against Westmont, contributing two goals and chipping in two assists. He also displayed solid chemistry with junior Ignacio Tellechea, a returning starter who looks to better the four goals he scored last year for the squad. With the addition of freshman Carter Clemmensen, the Arizona Gatorade player of the year last season, UCSB should easily top its goal total from last season. In the midfield, Santa Barbara returns two studs: sophomore Rodney Michael and junior captain Noah Billingsley. Billingsley struggled with injuries last season but was a key cog of the lineup when healthy. When he started, the Gauchos had a 5-1-4 record, but the team went just 1-6-1 when Billingsley was unable to play. Michael was one of the lone bright spots for UCSB last season, leading the team in both goals and assists en-route to a spot on the all-conference team as a freshman. With another year of training under his belt ""î as well as experience playing for the U-20 Sierra Leone national team ""î Michael will once again provide an offensive threat for Santa Barbara on the wing. While UCSB was sound on defense last season, the additions of sophomore Carson Vom Steeg and junior Faouzi Taieb should make the side's back line even more dominate. Vom Steeg, the son of Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg, played for Stanford last year, appearing in 18 games for a side that went on to win the national championship. While he was unable to play in the exhibition match due to injury, Vom Steeg will immediately improve the organization and shape of the Gauchos' back line. Taieb, a transfer from St. Francis who was named the NEC defensive player of the year last season, showed his worth immediately in the exhibition match, leading a back line that didn't allow a shot on goal in the entire 90 minutes. Taieb was also named to the MAC HERMANN award watch list ""î a list that highlights the top 75 players in the country heading into the season. If the two can get on the same page, the Gauchos should have arguably the most formidable back line in the conference. UCSB won't have any grace period for their new players to get acclimated, as their first match of the season comes against St. John's, a historically strong program that has already topped a top-25 team in the preseason. The other biggest tests in the off-season for Santa Barbara will come against Butler and UCLA, both in September. The Bulldogs were selected to finish second in the Big East conference, and before last season, the Bruins had made 34 consecutive NCAA tournaments. In conference play, the Gauchos will take on last season's Big West champion, Cal State Fullerton, at home on Oct. 6, and they will finish off the regular season at home Oct. 27 against Cal Poly in the traditional Blue-green rivalry game.

sports,The Freshman Guide To UCSB Sports In 2018-19,24-Aug-18,4:05 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/the-freshman-guide-to-ucsb-sports-in-2018-19/,"Tortillas took to the air as UCSB scored the first goal of the night. Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus It is no secret that UC Santa Barbara is not a typical college sports powerhouse. Our location, combined with our party reputation and lack of a football team, make for little hype surrounding our college game days. While game days are a staple source of school spirit at other big schools, UCSB has yet to see similar excitement over sports in quite some time. With so many teams on the rise this upcoming year, we want to provide both incoming freshmen and returning students with a guide of what to look forward to and, hopefully, work toward cultivating a stronger, more unified sports culture here on campus. UCSB can become a strong sports school in the future ""î we know this because we have seen glimpses of greatness in the past. Early footage from the 90s of the men's basketball team facing #2 UNLV in the Thunderdome paints a very different image of our school than recent years. The palpable energy and electricity which gave the Thunderdome its name has yet to reach the same level as in the past, but our 2018-19 men's basketball team might just have the power to turn the tide. Star junior guard Max Heidegger (ranked second in the Big West after scoring 19.1 points per game last year) and the Gauchos are aiming for success ""î not just in the Big West, but on a national scale. While attendance was good last year, this year could and should be historic in terms of on-court production and off-court support. Head coach Joe Pasternack and various players on the team consistently pressed the point last season that their team feeds off the home crowd's energy more than anything else, and their 12-2 home record backs that up. It's up to us Gauchos to make the Thunderdome into a place that our opponents do not feel confident playing in. One of the strongest, most consistent sources of school spirit is our blue-green rivalry with Cal Poly SLO, and nowhere is that more apparent than with our respective men's soccer team. Other than the fact that in the last decade the matchups between SLO and UCSB here at Harder stadium have drawn five of the largest NCAA regular season crowds in history, the pride, and tortilla throwing, makes these games a hallmark of the UCSB experience. Forwards Noah Billingsley and Rodney Michael were both selected for the preseason All-Big West team, and it looks like UCSB will have one of the most dynamic offenses in the conference. The preseason coaches poll also had the Gauchos coming in second in the Big West this year, and although Cal Poly was last, they always seem to find a way to make the rivalry games interesting. If there is one sports event to show up to this year, it is the clash between these two squads here on†October 27th, so make sure to stock up on tortillas far in advance. The last major storyline this upcoming year will be surrounding the continued dominance of junior volleyball standout Lindsey Ruddins. In the first half of her career here as a Gaucho, Ruddins has proved to be one of the most dominant forces in the country. Her accolades include the Big West Player of the Year award, AVCA All-American status and, most impressively, top in the country in kills per set last year with a whopping 5.84 per game. She literally changes opposing teams' game plans by herself, and we are lucky enough to have her on the UCSB women's volleyball team. It is rare to see a talent of that magnitude in any sport at any school, and as she heads into the latter half of her career here, the opportunity to see her will be gone before you know it. Do yourself a favor and get to a game before that time comes. These definitely are not the only interesting storylines going into the new school year. All of our Club and Division I sports teams are intriguing and exciting in their own way, and, although we aren't a typical sports school, there is a niche for everyone here. A huge part of college is exploration, and sports are just another avenue for that. Whether it be going as a fan, playing intramural or even covering them for an article, showing our enthusiasm for UCSB at sports games is what taking pride in being a Gaucho is all about.

sports,UCSB Women's Volleyball Aims To Defy Expectations,24-Aug-18,4:34 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-24/ucsb-womens-volleyball-aims-to-defy-expectations/,"Charlie Robinson swings at a quick set. Sicheng Wang/Daily Nexus Fall is here and the women's volleyball season is back and ready to go. This will be the seventh season for Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch as she hopes to guide this very promising squad to success in the upcoming 2018 season. There are many reasons to be excited about this year's team, such as the many returning contributors from 2017 as well as the youth and potential of a very talented recruiting class. The Gauchos will only be losing two seniors from last year, which allows the returners to grow and improve themselves as well as their chemistry as a team. UCSB's five leaders in kills from last season were all underclassmen, and thus they are all returning as veterans in 2018. One of these five is star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, who led the NCAA with 5.84 kills per set in 2017 and plans on returning to form again this year. Also returning are the Gauchos' leaders in assists from last year, senior setters Annie Hasselmann and Lexi Rottman, who will benefit from another year of growth with a similar team. For a team that struggled at times last season to put everything together and compete, the return of most of the main contributors is important to having a comeback season. While many key players will be returning to the floor again in 2018, Head Coach Lantagne Welch has also added more depth to the Gaucho roster by way of six freshman recruits and one transfer. These Gaucho newcomers will certainly benefit from playing alongside the experience of the eight upperclassmen on the team, but they will also be asked to contribute a significant amount in their first year due to the upside and talent of these accomplished freshmen. One of the Gauchos' weaknesses in years past has been their overall depth, and opposing teams were able to exploit that over the course of a match. However, with so many experienced veterans and new pieces, the previous lack of depth should no longer be a weakness, but rather a strength that will benefit Lantagne Welch's squad this season. Last season was difficult for the Gauchos, as they got off to a rough start and were only able to win one non-conference game in the early stages of the season. They managed to pick things up during conference play and put together a solid 7-9 record against Big West opponents. The team will certainly expect more consistent play throughout the season with a more experienced and talented team this time around. There is a lot of optimism going into this season with many interesting new pieces and returning stars; however, this does mean that expectations will be higher for the Gauchos and Coach Lantagne Welch. UCSB women's volleyball has not had a winning record in the Big West since the 2013 season, during which they went 13-3, won a share of the conference title and secured an NCAA tournament berth. While the expectations might not be that high for this year, improvement is expected, and the team knows this, so they will definitely come out of the gate motivated to show that this year is different. The Gauchos begin their season on Friday, Aug. 24, with a match against the Cincinnati Bearcats, during which they hope to get their season started off on the right note. Comments are closed.

sports,1-0 Gauchos Shut Out St. Johns for First Regular Season Victory,25-Aug-18,1:21 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-25/1-0-gauchos-shut-out-st-johns-for-first-regular-season-victory/,"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus On Friday, the UCSB men's soccer team snatched its eighth season-opener in a row, this year against previously unbeaten St. John's. With a 2-0 victory and consequent 1-0 non-conference record, Santa Barbara now flaunts two shutouts in its early matchups, the last being a lofty exhibition win against Westmont College. Rookie forward Carter Clemmenson marked the first goal of the 2018 season""îand of his own UCSB career. Clemmenson's goal was later followed by a goal courtesy of second-year forward Rodney Michael, each contributing to their team's success.  The Red Storm's fall to the Gauchos was the first of its kind in the competitors' three-game history, and the mark of defeat lies in their now 0-1 record.  In pursuit of redemption following last year's 2-1 upset, the 2018 Santa Barbara squad appeared confident and prepared, played swiftly, and came ready to attack.  Up to the final minutes of the first half, however, the game remained in a deadlock as both teams struggled to take control of the field. Though Santa Barbara out-shot its competitor 6-3 during the dry spell, the closest the team got to scoring came at the hands""îor rather, feet""î of junior forward Noah Billingsley whose shot was blocked by opposing goalie Lenny Wilson in the 22nd minute.  However, following a pivotal substitution replacing Rodney Michael with the freshman Clemmenson, the Gauchos finally secured a lead in the 40th minute. Off a throw in delivered by defender Hunter Ashworth, Clemmenson headed the ball into the back of the net. Debuting in the first season game of his career at Santa Barbara, the Gatorade Arizona Player of the Year made his transition into collegiate play look second-nature. With two goals and an assist across last week's exhibition match and this season opener, Clemmenson's integration so far into the Gaucho frontline feels seamless.  UCSB's offensive control continued into the second half, leaving the Red Storm shot-less for the next almost thirty minutes while they attempted to score twice more. In the 70th minute, sophomore forward Rodney Michael scored the ninth goal of his UCSB career in a breakaway assisted by teammate Sahid Conteh. Rodney Michael pushes the ball past defenders. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus With five major collegiate accolades behind him including 2017 College Soccer News All-Freshman First Team and 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year, the Sierra Leone native shows a steadfast command of the field and a fluid coherence with his teammates. His performance against St. John's only reaffirms his vital presence on the roster.  The Red Storm responded to their competitor's goal, however, almost immediately. Tani Oluwaseyi, one of the seven St. John's members to make their D1 debut that game, took a threatening shot on goal just seconds after his opponent. In a true rookie vs. rookie face-off, Gaucho Ben Roach blocked Oluwaseyi's attempt, a save that earned him and the rest of the Santa Barbara their first shutout of the season. Standing in goal the entire game, Roach deflected each of the total two shots on goal sent by the Red Storm.  With this type of rookie-and-returner chemistry and an opening shutout to show for it, the 2018 season looks promising for Santa Barbara. The Gauchos have little time for dwelling on their victory, however, as they make a quick return tomorrow, Sunday, August 26, against UC Riverside at Harder Stadium. The game will start at 7:00pm as UCSB will aim to continue their early-season momentum.

sports,"Early Success Continues, UCSB Defeats UC Riverside 3-1 at Home",27-Aug-18,4:06 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-27/early-success-continues-ucsb-defeats-uc-riverside-3-1-at-home/,"Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus ""úA step forward""ù is what head coach Tim Vom Steeg deemed his team's 3-1 dub against long-time conference competitor UC Riverside; however, the game doubles as the 250th win of his 20-year career, making it more of a milestone than just a step in the right direction.  Last night's win kept the Gauchos' record spotless at 2-0 while their fellow California-based opponents took yet another hit, sending them to a 0-2 overall count.  The two UC's met twice last year in conference play, the second time ending in a sore 0-1 loss in Big West quarterfinals that knocked Santa Barbara out of the running for the championship. As Vom Steeg described in last night's post-game press conference, this year's victorious outcome constituted just one part of the ongoing ""úredemption tour""ù that has so far defined the 2018 season.  Though familiar with their competitor, it wasn't until the 37th minute that the Gauchos caught up to the Highlanders' seemingly unpredictable gameplay and made their mark offensively. The play began with a free kick taken from the left side by junior Thibault Candia. Frontman Sahid Conteh, posted opposite of his counterpart, caught the rebound off the goalie's initial save and crossed the ball into the box where Faozi Taeb headed it into the net.  The junior transfer's goal unleashed an unrelenting attack on the Highlanders. UCSB's defense remained solid throughout the game and seldom allowed the opposing attackers quality chances on goal. Their outstanding coverage ensured routine saves for the unchallenged goalie Ben Roach.  Meanwhile, UCSB's offense offered little reprieve to the UC Riverside roster. Santa Barbara increased its passing through the midfield, seamlessly transitioning the ball from one player to another as each maneuvered their way through their opponent.  It took just ten minutes for Candia to play a pass to midfielder Joseph Ammer who sent it up the field to freshman Carter Clemmenson. Facing away from the goal above the 18 yard box, Clemmenson broke the defenders with a one-touch that allowed him to launch the ball over the goalie's head. If not for midfielder Daniel Aguirre's last minute goal, the Gauchos' offense would have gone unmatched. Perhaps the most dangerous attacking player on UCR's roster, the sophomore took advantage of a lapse in defense, sending a powerful 20 yard shot that cleared the inside of the post and cut UCSB's lead in half. Once again, however, Santa Barbara reasserted itself. With minutes left in the game, Axel Mendez, a senior midfielder, fooled the UCR defenders in what seemed like a routine way to kill time. Instead, Mendez took the ball along the end line and played it beautifully into his new teammate Migel Gomez, firing a headline-worthy goal into the top left net in the 90th minute.  It is this baseline cohesiveness that has so far been vital to the the Gaucho's success. Stacked with 10 returners and four or so solid newcomers, the 2018 roster is a rarity and a luxury at its core. Able to substitute player for player without compromise""îreplacing Billingsley with Clemmenson, for example""îCoach Vom Steeg sees huge potential for the upcoming season.  However, Santa Barbara prepares to take the road for their first away games of the season this week. The team will face stiff competitors Portland and Seattle University each of whom will test the Gauchos' early success. The weekend kicks off at the Nike Portland International on Friday August 31 at 7pm.

sports,Gauchos to Face Portland and Seattle in First Set of Road Games,28-Aug-18,4:27 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-08-28/gauchos-to-face-portland-and-seattle-in-first-set-of-road-games/,"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus Fresh off consecutive home victories over St. John's and UC RIverside to kick off the season, the UCSB men's soccer team will look to keep its momentum. The team will travel to face both Portland University and Seattle University this week. The Gauchos were in full control during both of their opening week matches, displaying an attacking flair that was all too absent last season. Between the two games, Santa Barbara chipped in five goals, while only conceding once. Freshman striker Carter Clemmensen's performance even earned him the Big West player of the week award, as he scored two goals during the week despite coming off of the bench in both matches. Junior transfer defender Faouzi Taieb also had a big first week for his new team, leading the side to a clean sheet in their first match before scoring a goal in the second match against the Highlanders. But it wasn't just the newcomers who led UCSB to success this past week. Sophomore Sahid Conteh continues to look comfortable commanding the midfield, pitching in a goal and two assists during the week, and perennial goal-scoring threat Rodney Michael also found the back of the net in the match against Riverside. So far, the new acquisitions and returning talent have gelled seamlessly, creating a much stronger side than the one from last season. This week presents a whole new challenge to Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg and the Gauchos, however, as they must travel to the Pacific Northwest to take on two programs that are receiving votes in the top 25. On Friday, UCSB will match up against a strong Portland side (1-0-1) that is led by Junior forward Benji Michel. After leading the team with 10 goals last season""ì as well as All-WCC first team honors, Michel scored first in both of the team's matches this season, and should prove to be a handful for the Gauchos revamped backline to deal with. The Pilots, who lie just outside of the top-25 rankings, were picked to finish second in the WCC, and will be the Gauchos first true test of the season. Things don't get any easier for Santa Barbara after that; on Sunday, they must face off against No.22 Seattle(0-1-0), who in their first match of the season were upset by New Mexico 4-2. The Redhawks dominated possession in that match, but played the entirety of the second half a man down after receiving a red card in the beginning stages of the first half. On paper, Seattle should prove to be one of the most difficult matches of the season for UCSB. The Redhawks returned many of their starters from last season's team that made the NCAA tournament, including senior defender Nathan Aune. Aune was named the WAC defensive player of the year last season, as well as a second-team All-American, and is a shortlist candidate for the MAC HERMANN award. On the offensive side, Senior Forward Sergio Rivas was voted the preseason conference player of the year after chipping in eight goals and six assists last season. The dominance of both Rivas and Aune is a big reason why the Redhawks were voted preseason favorites to win the WAC this season. While both matchups look intimidating""ìespecially on the road""ì the Gauchos will be eager to prove that last season was a fluke""ì and that this past week was not. UCSB will take on Portland Friday at 7 p.m., before travelling further up the coast and facing Seattle on Sunday at 6 p.m. Comments are closed.

While the Gauchos dominated possession throughout the game""ì even launching 12 shots against the Pilots""ì the team struggled to find that elusive goal to get a result. On the flip side, despite only launching two shots on goal the entire game, Portland's efficiency in the final third propelled them to their second win on the season. Behind an energized crowd and a raucous student section, the Pilots would only need one shot to secure the victory. After a sloppy giveaway by UCSB in their own half in the 56th minute, star forward Benji Michel slotted a shot past the outstretched hand of Ben Roach to make sure the Pilots remained unbeaten. Santa Barbara started off the first half positively, controlling the game in the midfield and preventing Portland from getting any good looks on goal. Sophomore holding midfielder Sahid Conteh acted as the glue for the Gauchos, making two key tackles in the box to prevent the Pilots from firing on Freshman goalie Ben Roach. On offense, Conteh also acted as a catalyst, often times launching the ball wide to Junior Forward Noah Billingsley, whose pace created problems all night for the Pilots defense. In the 28th minute, that duo thought they had given the Gauchos the lead when Conteh's probing pass found a sprinting Billingsley, who then calmly put the ball in the back of the net. However, the side ref ruled the goal back for offsides""ì foreshadowing a long night for the Gauchos that would feature bountiful opportunities but a lack of an end product. Santa Barbara also nearly found the back of the net in the 53rd minute, when Junior Axel Mendez fired a low shot that Portland keeper Kienan Weekes parried to the right. In total, Weekes was forced to make five saves, while Roach only had to make one save the entire night. It was merely three minutes later that Portland would take the lead with the ultimately decisive goal by Michel, who up to that point had caused trouble for the Gaucho defense all night. Michel's combination of pace and strength proved to be formidable for the typically strong Santa Barbara backline, and Michel truly proved to be the only offensive threat for the Pilots on the night. That was all they would need; however, after sprinting past the last man, Michel calmly sent the ball to the right of the diving Roach, who had no chance. Despite a flurry of long balls sent into the box towards the end of the game, UCSB was unable to beat Weekes on the night. While star Sophomore Rodney Michael predictably caused chaos on the right wing, his crosses lacked the finesse that they typically possess. Portland's back line also did a good job of ensuring that forwards Carter Clemmenson and Thibault Candia had no room to operate; any time either touched the ball, they were immediately closed down. The Gauchos must now bounce back quickly from their first loss of the season, as they take on No.22 Seattle on Sunday. Once again in a hostile environment, Santa Barbara will need to clean up its offensive woes if they hope to maintain a winning record on the season.

Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus The Santa Barbara women's volleyball team took a trip out east to the University of Denver where they played a set of three games in two days against stout competition in the Denver Classic. Coming into the weekend the UCSB women's squad sported a 2-1 record and had won their last two matches coming into Friday's game. The Gauchos ended up dropping their first two games of the weekend against Denver and Sacramento State before ultimately prevailing in their final match versus McNeese State.  UCSB dropped its opener to the Denver Pioneers in a thriller of a back-and-forth game that came down to the fifth set to determine a winner. The Gauchos were lead by Redshirt Junior Lindsey Ruddins who put up a monster statistical night with 27 kills, 12 digs, and a .386 kill percentage. She also found some support in teammates Olivia Lovenberg and Emilia Petrachi, who tallied 55 assists and 20 digs, respectively. This was a competitive match that saw each team alternate winning sets and Denver barely eked it out at the end, winning the fifth and final set 25-23. Saturday's slate of games for the Gauchos featured matches against McNeese State and Sacramento State, in a difficult doubleheader following Friday night's grueling five-set match. The day began with an exciting match against the Sacramento State Hornets, and even though the Gauchos suffered a three sets to none loss, each set was decided by two points as the two squads battled back and forth for the entire game. Lindsey Ruddins again lead the way with 15 kills and 14 digs, Olivia Lovenberg added 40 assists, and Charlie Robinson also added 11 kills to help the Gauchos keep it competitive. The three sets played in this match all featured come-from-behind efforts by both teams, however Sac State managed to pull out the win in all three sets in order to complete the sweep. The second match of the Saturday doubleheader featured the Gauchos going up against the McNeese State Cowgirls. After dropping the previous two matches in the Denver Classic, the Gauchos came out against McNeese State and earned a decisive win hinging on a great team defensive performance. UCSB won the first two sets by scores of 25-19 and 25-14, dropped the third set narrowly by a 25-22 margin, but recovered to clinch the win in the fourth set with a score of 25-17. Ruddins again lead the way for the Gauchos with 18 kills and 9 digs, but big games from several other Gauchos were what provided the spark in this one. Three other Gauchos in addition to Ruddins accrued double digit kills in this one, including Megan Lewis with 10, Nicole Omwanghe with 11, and Torre Glasker with 12. Freshman Olivia Lovenberg also had another great outing as she came up one assist shy of her season high with 54 assists. A win such as this one is important to get some confidence back for the team after two tough losses and it could prove to push the team in the right direction.  The next time the Gauchos will take the floor will be back in the friendly confines of the Thunderdome against Texas Tech on Friday, September 7th at 6pm. This will be one of three games played as part of the Thunderdome Classic next weekend.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team was on the road yet again Thursday and again showed its mental toughness battling back from an early 1-0 deficit to come back and best Fresno State 2-1 when all was said and done. With the win, the Gauchos are now 6-1 overall on the season and are sitting behind only UC Riverside in the Big West standings in non-conference play as the Highlanders boast an unbeaten 5-0 record. Thursday's win also improved UCSB's road record to an impressive 4-1 mark. On the flip side, Fresno State drops to 1-4-1 on the year with its lone win coming in its season opener against Montana. Additionally,†the Bulldogs have now lost three straight, all three being against Big West opponents as they lost to UCR 2-0 and Cal State Fullerton 3-0. In this match, Fresno State came out the aggressors playing at their own home turf. Within the first minute the Bulldogs already earned a shot on goal and by the second minute, they were on the board as junior Melissa Ellis knocked one past UCSB††junior goalkeeper†Hanna DeWeese from the top of the box. Finding themselves down early is not something the Gauchos are used to but it is an uphill battle they overcame this past weekend against Cal. In that match, UCSB found themselves down 2-0 after one half of play. Suddenly, being down 1-0 with 88 minutes to go isn't ideal but it certainly isn't backbreaking. Santa Barbara regrouped and would not allow another shot from the home team all half. In fact, UCSB turned the table and became the aggressor earning nine shots on the half. The Gauchos best chance to score the equalizer came in the 44th minute†when junior forward Shaelan Murison's shot hit the crossbar. UCSB also had chances in the 29th and 32nd minute but senior Bulldog goalkeeper Nicole Theroux saved them both. She would finish with four saves after only playing the first half. It didn't take long after the break for the Santa Barbara to respond with results. At minute 50, senior defender Ryan Kokoska finished with a snipe and an erupting goal to even up the contest at one score apiece. Kokoska entered the game off the bench in the ninth minute as she elevated and confirmed coach Paul Stumpf's substitution patterns. Conductors of its own fate, UCSB sent junior Shaelan Murison out for a penalty kick in the 74th minute. Despite a seesaw back and forth scuffle between the two teams in the second half, Murison had a chance to propel her squad to a late lead.  The junior shocked a laser in the back of the net with fifteen condense minutes to spare as she single-handedly drew the life out of her opposing squad. With a 2-1 lead, the ""òChos maintained control and emphasized focus down the stretch with premier communication. A stern Bulldogs squad eyed a game-tying goal to pull even with UCSB in the second half but was shut down by Junior keeper Hannah DeWeese who picked up her first win of the season Thursday evening. DeWeese captained her squad with poise and tenacity alike as she saved three screaming shots over the final ten-minute frame to reinforce the single-goal victory. Although conference play has yet to begin between opposing Big West foes, the Gauchos look more dominant and complex as the team continues to evolve and expand on their chemistry. They progress and adjust with every close game and look like promising contenders with conference play right around the corner. UCSB will now look forward to a bit of a break as it doesn't resume season play until next week earning a break this weekend. Santa Barbara will face Weber State at 6:30 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14th at†Wildcat Soccer Field.

sports,Big West Preview: Men's Soccer Edition,20-Sep-18,5:35 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/big-west-preview-mens-soccer-edition/,"Dustin Harris | Daily Nexus With a strong 4-2 start to the season, the UCSB men's soccer team looks to be real threats to win the Big West Conference for the first time since 2010. Here, we detail the competition they will face in the conference this season. Cal Poly: Despite being chosen to finish last in the conference this season, the Mustangs have showcased their grit so far this season. While they only sport a 2-3-1 record, Cal Poly played tight matches against Portland and Seattle, who both defeated the Gauchos. A bright spot for the Mustangs this season has been sophomore midfielder Emmanuel Perez, who already has two goals and two assists despite tallying zero for both last season. Sac State: Sacramento State's defense has struggled out of the gate, with the team already allowing 17 goals in seven games, including a whopping six goals against Cal. However, the Hornets have proven they can hang with anybody ""î as evidenced by their tie against then-ranked Portland. Offensively, Sacramento State has tallied a solid 10 goals, with senior forward Dominic Scotti pitching in a team-high four goals. Look for the Hornets to get into plenty of high-scoring affairs during conference play. CSUN: No. 25 Cal State University Northridge's offense has been on fire to start the season, with already 18 goals in eight games despite a brutal schedule. Northridge also has signature victories on its resume after defeating No.17 Cornell and, perhaps more impressively, No.11 UCLA in Westwood. Sophomore forward Daniel Trejo has already created five goals and four assists, nearly matching his 2017 total of seven goals in far fewer games. If CSUN can keep its scorching hot offense rolling, it is difficult to envision any Big West opponent being able to keep up. Fullerton: The preseason favorites to win the Big West Conference, Cal State Fullerton has sputtered out of the gate, only winning two of its first seven matches (2-2-3 overall). The main roadblock for the Titans this far has been their ability to manufacture offense; so far, the team is only averaging one goal per game. Expect Fullerton, which returns nine of its starters from last season's Big West winning squad, to pick up the offense as senior leaders Ross Mcphie and Samuel Goni rediscover their form from last season. Davis: No.13 UC Davis has already surpassed all expectations this season; despite being picked to finish fourth in the conference, the Aggies have gone unbeaten in their first seven matches (5-0-2). The team's No. 13 rating is its highest since 2008 and is in large part due to its lockdown defense, which has only allowed five goals in seven games. That backline is led by junior goalkeeper Wallis Lapsley, who has saved 27 shots already this season. Davis looks to be the clear-cut favorite heading into conference play. Riverside: After eight games, UC Riverside remains winless with an 0-7-1 record. It's not time to panic just yet, however, as the Highlanders have faced a loaded schedule, including their early season loss against UCSB. That being said, the fact that Riverside has allowed 24 goals in eight games does little to suggest the team will compete for the Big West title this season. Irvine: Aided by a rather favorable schedule, UC Irvine currently resides with a pretty 5-2-1 record, including a 4-1 record at home. Another team founded on their defense, the Anteaters have only given up five goals so far this season, with junior forward Jose Ortiz leading the team with five goals of his own. With their only real test of the season coming against San Diego State ""î a game they lost ""î the Anteaters will have to prove themselves during conference play. A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the September 20th edition of The Daily Nexus.

sports,Big West Preview: Women's Volleyball,20-Sep-18,5:49 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/big-west-preview-womens-volleyball/," † The UCSB women's volleyball team enters Big West play tied for second in the conference with an 8-4 record. That's a marked improvement from last year, when the Gauchos went 1-11 in non-conference play, but that's all meaningless now that the real games are set to begin. What does matter, however, is the confidence built from a solid, non-conference performance and the experience of UCSB's returning cast of contributors. The team sits among some of the best teams in the NCAA across several statistics this season, [and returns reliable defensive specialist Emilia Petrarchi and last season's NCAA leader in kills per set, Lindsey Ruddins.] Ruddins is back and humming in 2018, as she's already garnering a couple Big West Player of the Week Awards. This junior outside hitter is second in the nation with 5.57 kills per set so far this year, and leads the Big West in points per set as well. She's been set up primarily by freshman setter Olivia Lovenberg, who is 13th in the NCAA with 11.46 assists per set, second best among all freshman. Lovenberg, like Ruddins, has received a couple Big West awards already, and will be looking to add a handful more in conference play. The Gauchos have been unable to develop a secondary threat next to Ruddins to keep opposing teams honest, something that could hold the team back these next several weeks. Torre Glasker, another outside hitter, is second on the team and 17th in the conference with 2.54 kills per set. UCSB's pre-conference schedule was light, featuring no ranked teams and only a couple teams on the bubble of NCAA prominence. Big West play, then, will be a test of the unproven squad. They'll be taking on a variety of talents, ranging from some of the worst teams to one of the best. What follows is a speculative ranking of those teams, and where UCSB likely fits in as it heads into the season. Cal Poly ""ì The 15th ranked team in the NCAA, the Big West appears to be the Mustangs' if they want it. Led by outside hitter Torrey Van Winden (7th in the NCAA with 4.93 kills/set) and her sister, Allie Van Winden (8th in the Big West with 3.17 k/s), the Mustangs have a potent attack set up by freshman setter Avalon DeNecochea (55th in the NCAA with 10.32 assists/set). They've got two wins over #17 UCLA and will be seeking to defend their 2017 Big West title. Long Beach State ""ì The Beach enters Big West play a half-game behind UCSB and UC Davis at 8-5, but that's with losses to #17 UCLA and #12 Oregon. They've got a stifling pair of blockers up front in Emma Kirst (1.06 blocks/set) and Yizhi Xue (1.00 b/s). The offensive load is distributed similarly, with Hailey Harward, Kashuana Williams and their almost three kills per set bearing the brunt of it. Hawaii ""ì The Rainbow Warriors are usually contenders in the Big West, and while their 4-5 non-conference record isn't too impressive, they'll likely be near the tops of the standings in a few weeks' time. Two losses to #12 Oregon set the team back a bit last week, but they've got the tools to overcome. Setters Faith Ma'afala and Norene Iosia have Hawaii sitting in 28th in the NCAA in assists per set, and McKenna Granato leads the team in kills per set with 3.48. UC Davis ""ì Tied with UCSB with an 8-4 record, the Aggies are a well-rounded squad. They're 38th in the nation in opposing hitting percentage and 47th in kills per set, but they've yet to be tested against a top-25 team. Malia Bolko is 21st in the NCAA with 5.38 digs per set as the linchpin of the defense, and Emily Allen leads the offense and is 5th in the Big West with 4.09 kills per set. UC Irvine ""ì Not much stands out about the 6-6 Anteaters from their non-conference slate. They dropped two games to top 25 teams, one to #23 Utah and the other to #8 Illinois. They're not in the top 50 in the NCAA in any statistics and Haley DeSales and her 3rd-best 4.74 digs per set is their only top-three Big West statistic. Conference play will be revealing for this team, with a lot of space to move up, or down. Cal State Fullerton ""ì Fullerton also enters Big West play with a 6-6 nonconference record, but they don't have the excuse of any top 25 losses. Their schedule, compared to Irvine's, was much easier, slotting them in below the Anteaters. The Titans are 49th in opposing hitting percentage, thanks largely to Maya Riddlesprigger's 4th in the Big West 1 .00 blocks per set. UC Riverside ""ì The Highlanders are 25th in the NCAA in digs per set, but all that's gotten them is a 5-6 record, even without any top 25 games. Setter Chelsea Doyle is third in the Big West with 10.00 assists per set and 9th with 3.48 digs per set. Kaiulani Ahuna has provided the bulk of their offense with 5.25 kills per set, 4th in the NCAA, but she's also far and away 1st in the Big West with 93 errors. CSUN ""ì Statistically, the Matadors are the worst team in the Big West. They're a conference-worst, coming in 4-8, although that includes losses to #11 Florida and #13 Washington. They're last in kills, digs, blocks and assists per set, as well as hitting percentage. They're only second-to-last in service aces per set, however, so at least they've got that to hold on to.

sports,Culture Shock: Gauchos Dialed in with Coach Pasternack leading the Pack,20-Sep-18,5:37 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/culture-shock-gauchos-dialed-in-with-coach-pasternack-leading-the-pack/,"Max Heidegger reaches past the defense toward the hoop. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Following a summer filled with determination and growth, the Santa Barbara Gauchos have returned to the gym with ambition and high hopes for the upcoming season. While UCSB came up short last year in the Big West Tournament, the squad is eager to build on the biggest program turnaround in college basketball last year. It's no coincidence that the team's turnaround came at the same time that Coach Joe Pasternack took over the head coaching duties. After previous coaching positions at storied programs such as the University of Arizona and UC Berkeley, Pasternack took his second head coaching job with UCSB in March of 2017. As he took the helm, there was an instant shift in the culture of UCSB basketball. Pasternack stretched his recruiting range by adding a plethora of veteran graduate students and transfer players, and Santa Barbara eyed epic success on the hardwood once again. Although four of the five starters from last year's historic squad departed in the offseason, the Gauchos ushered in another wave of transfer students who are keen on making an immediate impact on the team. The lone incumbent starter, junior guard Max Heidegger, has assumed a prominent leadership role as a weathered Gaucho to welcome his incoming teammates. ""úWe have seven or eight new guys,""ù Heidegger explained. ""úWe're [focused] on building camaraderie, getting everyone into our system and doing what Coach P. expects from us.""ù Of those players who made the move to sunny Santa Barbara, the majority of the transfer additions are guards and wings. Spearheaded by sophomore point guard Devearl Ramsey, who redshirted last year after a move from the University of Nevada, and graduate transfer Ar'mond Davis, who brings tournament experience after his March Madness run with the University of Alabama last season, the new faces plan to make a significant impact early in the year. ""úIt makes practice competitive,""ù Heidegger joked. ""úOffense, get to the rim, do what we did last year; obviously we were the best offense in the Big West.""ù Heidegger harped on the team's focus for the upcoming year: ""úDefense, defense, defense ""¶ When I talk about what Coach P. wants for the culture, it's all about playing defense and playing hard; that's what we're getting everybody to do.""ù As the transfer guards get situated in their new roles and fight for a spot on the starting rotation, the Gauchos have also integrated a myriad of young talent into the program at the forward position. The freshmen forward duo of Jay Nagle and Amadou Sow tower over opponents at 6'8""ù and 6'9""ù respectively. As if the Twin Tower additions weren't enough, the Gauchos continued to reinforce their front court this offseason when the team introduced sophomore forward Robinson Idehen, a native Spaniard who staggers at a whopping 6'10""ù. As the big men get situated in their new digs, who better to mentor the young forwards than fifth-year senior center Ami Lakoju? With a first-hand look at the paradigm shift between Coach Williams and Coach Pasternack, Lakoju is the ideal guide to transition the new recruits into the culture that UCSB basketball is currently rebuilding. ""úWe have a lot of young talent,""ù Lakoju beamed. ""úIf you make a mistake, just brush it off. You have to focus on executing your job. Everybody has their own role.""ù The veteran big man had a career year last season playing in all 32 matches for the Gauchos, including starting seven games, as he facilitated in the absence of Jalen Canty. As he battles back from an offseason toe injury, Lakoju suggested that his game continues to evolve under Coach Pasternack. ""úMentally I've seen players grow under each coaching staff,""ù Lakoju observed. ""úI feel like the game is so mental. As a freshman, I didn't really see it that way ""¶ if you're strong mentally, physically you can do anything.""ù The complement of veteran leadership and young talent makes for a deadly combination. With Coach Joe Pasternack at the reigns, this Gaucho team reflects a shut-down defense along with an offensive attack that sends shivers down the spines of every Big West coach. While most teams would have a bleak outlook on this season following the departure of four starters, this Santa Barbara squad has unusually high potential in the upcoming year. With the recent talent brought in for the 2019 season, the Gauchos have high expectations for a successful Big West campaign and a deep run in postseason play.

sports,Gauchos Look to B(Ruin) UCLA's Top 25 Ranking,20-Sep-18,6:05 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-20/gauchos-look-to-bruin-uclas-top-25-ranking/,"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus With a solid 4-3 start to non-conference play, the UCSB men's soccer team is set to take on longtime rival No. 23 UCLA at home on Saturday night. The Gauchos have built up some momentum, recently, with wins over Butler and New Mexico State after a shaky 0-2 trip to the Pacific Northwest. Although they weren't able to come away with a win in their last game after a goal in double overtime by No. 17 St. Mary's, they now will come back to preserve their perfect 3-0 record at home. UCLA has also started the season strong, at one point even reaching No. 11 in the national rankings, but will be trying to avoid dropping consecutive games for the first time this year after a tough 1-2 loss to CSUN. Even though they are in different conferences, with UCSB playing in the Big West while UCLA competes in the PAC-12, these two teams definitely have a history. This ""úrivalry""ù may seem to be lopsided at first glance (UCLA has a 34-5-4 overall record against the Gauchos); however, the big games between these squads have almost all went to the Gauchos. Whether it be UCSB's 2006 National Championship victory over the Bruins, or their 2-0 win in front of a record-breaking crowd of 15,896 fans in 2010, time and time again it seems that the Gauchos were able to rise to the occasion when it mattered the most. While the stakes aren't as high in this year's matchup, the game coinciding with move-in weekend should bring in huge crowds and give Harder Stadium a postseason feel. As mentioned before, the Gauchos have been unbeatable at home so far this season. The energy of the UCSB crowd, who have consistently been near the top of the NCAA in attendance, definitely plays a role in energizing this team and the young players leading it. Sophomore Rodney Michaels earned Preseason All-Big West honors and has lived up to the hype so far, along with stepping up into a leadership role. The forward leads the team and is tied for seventh in the conference with three goals, all while having played in fewer games than six of the players in front of him. He makes up one-half of the youthful one-two punch that the Gauchos have expiremented with up top, along with freshman Carter Clemmenson, who has been a welcome surprise to start off the season. Clemmenson has already notched two goals, though only starting in one game, and if his production continues at this pace he could become a starting fixture for the team by the beginning of Big West play. These two, along with first-year goalie Ben Roach, have been able to produce now while still showing signs of potential for years to come, which should be an exciting prospect for any Gaucho fan. The Bruins also have a freshman standout of their own in midfielder Matt Hundley, who has an incredible stat-line of three goals and three assists through their first six games. Hundley has shown vision and a nose for the ball that even most upperclassmen don't have and his playmaking has helped open up the UCLA offense in unconventional ways. The biggest beneficiary of this free-flowing offense has definitely been junior Mohammed Kamara, whose four goals so far are good for second in the Pac-12. Because of† superb playmaking from both the midfield and backline (Erick Holt is tied for most assists on the team with three as a defender), the forward has been able to push up and put more pressure on the defense with great results. One of the keys to the game for the Gauchos' defense will have to be controlling the midfield and taking the Bruins out of their comfort zone. In their last game against St. Mary's, there were too many times where, instead of maintaining possession, the Gauchos opted to boot the ball up the field. Against UCLA, a team that has given up fewer than half of the shots and goals it has taken and scored, opportunities will be few and far between æ meaning that UCSB will have to capitalize on anything it can get. Ultimately, this is going to be an extremely fun game. The influx of new freshman who move in next weekend, combined with the youthful fast-paced style of the teams, should make for plenty of energy and exciting plays. Although the Bruins have had the edge historically, it might be time for a new era of Gauchos to flip the script.

sports,UCSB Men's Soccer Takes Down No. 23 Bruins,24-Sep-18,5:47 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-24/ucsb-mens-soccer-takes-down-no-23-bruins/,"Rodney Michael pushes the ball past defenders. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus As the final whistle blew on Saturday night the UCSB men's soccer team collapsed on the Harder Stadium pitch""î a combination of exhaustion and sheer excitement coursing through their bodies. Finally, they had the quality win they so desperately had been searching for all season, taking down No.23 UCLA 3-1. The Gauchos' hunger for an upset was evident from the opening whistle, though perhaps no single player embodied that spirit more than sophomore forward Rodney Michael. Michael was a threat the entire match, terrorizing the UCLA back three with his elite pace. Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg had opted to start the game with two forwards, allowing Michael to feed off of holdup play from fellow forward Carter Clemenson. ""úTheir formation allowed us to put our players in good positions,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""ú This whole year, we've been a dangerous team when we're able to put two forwards up front.""ù The formation also allowed ample space for creative midfielder Axel Mendez to serve balls to the forward. In the 15th minute""îa mere ten minutes after UCLA had scored a remarkable goal from 23 yards out""îMendez found Michael running forward, lofting a ball over the top of the UCLA defense. It merely took Michael two touches to outrun the defense, before he cooly slotted the ball to the bottom left corner to tie the score 1-1. ""úI think them scoring an early goal motivated us even more to go out and work harder,""ù Michael said. ""úI had been making that run early in the game, and on that play [Mendez] was able to find me. I was way ahead of the defenders, so it was an easy finish for me.""ù Because of the offensive firepower the Bruins have at their disposal, the Gauchos knew they couldn't settle. Less than a minute later, off a corner created once again by the pace of the forwards, a mad scram in front of goal resulted in a UCLA own goal, giving the Gauchos a 2-1 lead as the 5100 in attendance roared in approval. Five minutes later, the Gauchos added a third, this time off of a set piece play the team had practiced just the day before the match. ""úIn practice we worked on me standing in front of the keeper on corners and peeling off when the ball came,""ù Michael explained. ""úI was in the right place and the ball luckily fell for me; all I had to do was push the ball past the keeper.""ù With a comfortable 3-1 lead in hand, things began to get chippy on the pitch. Within the first 37 minutes of the half, UCLA had accumulated five yellow cards""îwith Vom Steeg doing his best to substitute off those players. But just 20 seconds after picking up his first yellow card, sophomore midfielder Sahid Conteh took down a UCLA player with a late challenge. The referee, eager to keep the game under control, immediately reached for his pocket, pulling out a second yellow for Conteh. Suddenly, the Gauchos had the unenviable task of holding the lead with only ten men for the next 50 minutes. ""úGoing a man down is not ideal, especially 35 minutes in,""ù junior defender Hunter Ashworth said.""ù For us, we didn't change anything""ì we just covered the extra player. I don't think we felt uncomfortable with ten players; if anything, that was the extra motivation we needed to get through the match.""ù After halftime, Santa Barbara was forced to withdraw deep in their own half, content with conceding possession to UCLA as long as they weren't threatening the goal. Despite lacking service, the UCSB forwards continued to impress with their work rate, chasing after every loose ball. On the defensive end, the Gauchos were more than content to give up set pieces""îas long as they weren't in an overly threatening position. UCSB seemed to win every aerial ball, keeping the Bruins at bay for a majority of the second half despite playing a man down. ""úWe haven't given up a goal on a set piece all season,""ù Ashworth said. ""ú Set pieces are an asset to our game that we look to capitalize on.""ù In the final ten minutes, the Bruins finally were able to break through""îlaunching three shots on goal""îbut freshman keeper Ben Roach stood strong, seemingly grabbing any loose ball in his vicinity. ""ú[Roach] played one of the finer games I've seen from a Santa Barbara goalie in a long, long time,""ù Vom Steeg said. When that final whistle blew, the relief on the faces of the UCSB players was palpable""îa quality win finally secured for their postseason resume. The victory propels the Gauchos to 5-3, while the Bruins fall to 4-3 with the loss. More importantly, Santa Barbara showed the world on Saturday that they can hang with any team in the country; that their postseason aspirations are not merely a pipe dream, but a legitimate reality.

sports,Gauchos Outlast Zags For 2nd-Straight Win,25-Sep-18,8:21 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-25/gauchos-outlast-zags-for-2nd-straight-win/,"Rodney Michael narrowly avoids a slide-tackle to keep possession. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus When you're fighting for an at-large bid to the College Cup, any win is a good win. Coming off their best game of the season and in an obvious ""útrap game""ù against a weak Gonzaga team, the UCSB men's soccer team did exactly what it had to do on Tuesday, holding off a late push from the Bulldogs to secure a 2-1 victory. With the win, Santa Barbara now moves to 6-3 on the season, while the ""òZags fall to 2-6-2. In front of 1,800 fans, the Gauchos started off the game on the front foot, dominating possession for the entire first half. Knowing they were overmatched, Gonzaga was content to essentially park the bus, having all 11 players play behind the ball when UCSB had possession. Despite the ""òZags' low line, Santa Barbara still created a flurry of chances in the first 20 minutes, mostly predicated around the wing play of junior forward Noah Billingsley on the right. Nine minutes in, Billingsley easily avoided the defender on the wing before playing a through ball to in-form sophomore Rodney Michael, whose rocket shot to the front post was parried by the keeper. Less than five minutes later, the duo hooked up once again; this time, Michael rounded the keeper before having his pass across the face of goal intercepted. In the 26th minute, Santa Barbara finally found paydirt. In a move similar to the first goal on Saturday night, senior midfielder Axel Mendez picked up the ball centrally, taking a daft touch before sending a long aerial ball past the defense and onto the right foot of Michael, who was immediately taken down by the Gonzaga keeper for a penalty. Michael stepped up to the spot, composed as ever, and sent the keeper the wrong way to give Santa Barbara the crucial first goal. ""úThis game was a lot easier than the game Saturday for me because there was a lot less pressure when I was on the ball,""ù Mendez said. ""úThat gave me time to pick out my teammates better and allowed me to work in space.""ù As has been the theme all season, Santa Barbara's aerial dominance allowed them to pick up an easy second goal ""î one that gave them some needed breathing space. Junior Ignacio Tellechea crossed the ball into the box off a corner, and after a scramble in front of the goal, junior defender Faouzi Taieb easily sent a right-footed shot past the keeper for his third goal on the season. Going into halftime, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg had a decision to make: Keep attacking the overmatched ""òZags, or stay back and try to hold on for the win. ""úWe decided in the second half that we wanted to defend first and make sure we got the win,""ù Vom Steeg said. With eight games in 28 days, Vom Steeg leaned heavily upon his bench in the second half, with the fatigue of many of the starters evident coming off such a big game on Saturday. That fatigue was especially evident at the back, with the team making a number of sloppy and uncharacteristic mistakes. Even in the first half, the Bulldogs had almost scored first when Taieb missed a clearance header, allowing the ""òZags to break through. Fortunately, freshman keeper Ben Roach made a huge save ""î the only one needed that night ""ï to preserve the lead. Toward the end of the second half, Gonzaga made things interesting when freshman Dimitrius Kiyega pushed a left-footed shot to the bottom left corner of the goal, bringing the Bulldogs within a goal. Despite a late flurry of balls sent into the box, the Gauchos held their line admirably, doing just enough in the second half to get the victory. ""úI'm not going to yell and scream about the second half, because we were just doing enough to win the game,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úWe got the two goals we needed, and once again our defense was good enough to get us the win.""ù Despite the less-than-convincing performance against a weak team, the Gauchos will take any victory they can get. Now, Santa Barbara must travel to Cal Poly SLO to take on the Mustangs. Last season, Cal Poly thrashed the Gauchos 4-1 in this game. After receiving votes in the coaches' poll this week, UCSB will need a victory in a difficult environment if it hopes to keep its dream of an at-large-bid to the college cup alive.

sports,"No. 5 UCSB to Visit No. 1 USC, Looks to Keep Momentum",27-Sep-18,5:14 AM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-27/no-5-ucsb-to-visit-no-1-usc-looks-to-keep-momentum/,"Boris Jovanovic searches for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus With only a single game remaining for the Gauchos before they begin conference play, UCSB stands with an overall record of 12-4. The team suffered their most recent loss at home to No. 3 Stanford last Saturday, effectively ending its four-game winning streak; however, the Gauchos' 12-win total is double that of any other team's in the Gold Coast Conference (GCC). Behind UCSB in the conference standings are Long Beach and Pepperdine, both sitting at 6-4 overall. Although Santa Barbara has played more games than its conference foes, three of the team's 12 wins have come against fellow GCC teams (Long Beach, Pacific and Pepperdine). UCSB has again moved through the national rankings this year, reaching the No. 5 spot in the latest week's poll. After losing senior standouts Shane Hauschild and Reed Cotterill from last year, someone on the Gauchos' roster was going to have to fill the scoring void left behind. Lucky for Santa Barbara, both Borislav Jovanovic and Ivan Gvozdanovic returned this season, and have been dominating the pool. The Serbian duo has been instrumental to the Gauchos' success thus far, but it shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone who followed the team last season. Both Jovanovic and Gvozdanovic played a large role aside Hauschild and Cotterill last year, and have continued their impact. As of statistics last updated on September 11th, Jovanovic leads his team with 26 goals off 50 shots. In the Gauchos' overtime win against Pepperdine this month, Jovanovic scored 6 goals, again proving his outright scoring ability. His performance earned the senior driver GCC Player of the Week honors for the third straight week on September 20th, a feat no other player has achieved in history.
Without a doubt, Jovanovic will be crucial to maintaining the Gauchos' momentum heading into league competition, but the depth on the Santa Barbara roster is likely a pleasant sign for head coach Wolf Wigo. Behind Jovanovic is the junior utility player Gvozdanovic, with 12 goals and 10 assists, but seven other players have combined for double digit scoring contributions, including redshirt sophomore Leo Yuno. Yuno, an attacker with only one less goal than Gvozdanovic, completes the triple-threat of UCSB's offensive ability. Another good sign for Coach Wigo is that the team's four losses have all come at the hands of Pac-12 leaders: No. 1 USC, No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Stanford, and No. 4 California. After its home loss to Stanford, Santa Barbara will get another chance against a top-ranked opponent this Sunday when the Gauchos visit USC. Despite losing to the Trojans 11-3 on September 15th, the Gauchos have both a shot at redemption and at avoiding a two-game losing streak. Whether or not they can knock off the No. 1 team in the country, the Gauchos have plenty to be confident about heading into GCC games next month. And, with Jovanovic's play showing no signs of slowing down, the team has a comfortable go-to option in crunchtime, as already displayed by UCSB's overtime victory against Pepperdine.

sports,Gauchos enter Big West Play with High Expectations after Strong Start,28-Sep-18,5:25 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-09-28/gauchos-enter-big-west-play-with-high-expectations-after-strong-start/,"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus Following an eventful kickoff to the season during which Big West teams showed down against non-conference opponents, the Gauchos look to get dialed into league play on Friday as the squad hosts rival UC Davis (3-5) for their first conference game of the season. UCSB has performed exceedingly well in the first half of the 2018 season. For the Gauchos, who boast a 7-4 record and are good for second place in the conference, the first match in Big West play has major implications for the remainder of the season. ""úIt's the most important game of the year,""ù Head Coach Paul Stumpf emphasized. ""úConference is our pathway to where we want to be, which is in the NCAA Tournament ""¶ but first we have to get to the Big West Tournament.""ù Coach Stumpf's 20-year tenure with UCSB is older than the lifespan of a handful of the younger players on the Santa Barbara squad that he's coaching this year. With his experience and intuition, the Gauchos have strong hopes for conference play and an astute game plan to further improve their successful year. ""úThere are eight conference games; we've got to win four,""ù Stumpf said. ""úFour wins and 12 points has gotten [teams] into the Big West Tournament ""¶ the last couple years, we've lost one or two games early; we put ourselves in a deep, deep hole. That's what we're trying to avoid, so [Davis] is the most important game of the season for us.""ù As Big West play starts up this coming weekend, here is a recap of each Big West squads' season up to this point: UC Riverside, 9-0-1 The Highlanders burst out of the gates in non-conference play and have shocked opponents early with an unbeaten record heading into league matches. Riverside entered the season projected to finish in the seventh spot in the Big West but has reflected sheer dominance prior to conference play. The squad is 8-0 when competing on its home pitch this year and has only allowed one single goal in the first half of the season. This week, the team received votes in the United Soccer Coaches Poll for the first time this season and ranks third in regional rankings. Riverside will travel to Cal State Fullerton for its first conference matchup. Hawaii, 5-3-1 Hawaii enters Big West play coming off back-to-back wins following the Rainbow Wahine Shootout tournament that was hosted by the squad. The Rainbow Wahine, who were projected to finish in ninth place in the Big West preseason poll, have surprised many in the front half of the season with winning records both at home and on the road. Hawaii opens league play on Friday evening as the team makes a road trip to UC Irvine. CSU Northridge, 4-3-1 The Matadors have shifted their focus to their first opponent of conference play, Cal Poly SLO, for a Friday evening road matchup. CSUN is unbeaten while on the road this season but sits at 0-3 while playing at home this year. The squad enters Big West play following a convincing 2-0 victory against Cal State Bakersfield last week.† Northridge opened the year in the projected fourth spot of the Big West preseason poll. Long Beach State, 5-4-1 Cal State Long Beach was forecasted to finish in the second spot of the Big West entering the 2018 season. Although the Dirtbags have struggled on the road this season with a 1-3 record, all four losses on the season have come against ranked teams: No. 2 USC, No. 8 University of Texas, No. 16 UCLA and No. 23 University of Auburn. Having significant experience against top-25 teams, Long Beach State is still considered a major contender in the Big West conference and a possible favorite for many analysts. The Dirtbags travel to Cal State Fullerton on Thursday for the first Big West Conference game of the year. UC Irvine, 4-5-1 Similarly to Long Beach, the Anteaters suffered a tough loss to No. 2 USC early on in the year. Of the five losses that Irvine has dropped this season, the Anteaters have been shutout in four games. The year kicked off with a first-place projection for Irvine, yet the squad has struggled as of late following a five-game road trip throughout September during which Irvine went 2-3 over that span. Hawaii travels to UC Irvine on Friday evening to kick of its Big West schedule. UC Davis, 3-5-2 The Aggies opened the year hosting the number-one team in the country as they suffered a tough loss to Stanford. The squad bounced back with a promising August, finishing the month with a 3-2 record, but they haven't recorded a win throughout all of September. Davis was projected to finish in the fifth spot of the Big West preseason poll and opens conference play on a road trip to UCSB on Friday evening. Cal State Fullerton, 3-7-1 While the Titans were projected to finish the season in the third spot of the Big West conference, Fullerton has struggled immensely this season, particularly on the road. CSUF has a 1-4-1 record in away games this year as the team has allowed 1.5 goals against per game on average. Following four straight losses, the Titans host Long Beach State on Thursday evening to open up Big West competition. Cal Poly SLO, 0-8-3 It's been a disappointing season so far for the Mustangs as they have yet to win a game during non-conference play. Granted, the team has faced a plethora of ranked opponents this year, but they have been blown out by three or more goals in each of the games. The Mustangs are projected to finish in eighth place in the Big West Conference this year, as the team hosts a stiff CSUN squad for its first Big West matchup of the year.

sports,Why the NBA will Surpass the NFL as America's Favorite Sport,3-Oct-18,5:24 AM,['Prescott Creveling'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-03/why-the-nba-will-surpass-the-nfl-as-americas-favorite-sport/,"Peyton Stotelmyre/Daily Nexus America and football are about as synonymous as UCSB students and partying. The NFL has become so deeply ingrained into American culture that the Super Bowl has become a national holiday, and even traditional holidays such as Thanksgiving are commonly centered around ""úthe game""ù for many families. Statistically, the sports industry has never seen an economic powerhouse like the NFL before, with its annual revenue coming in at roughly $13 billion. Regardless of its clear-cut dominance in viewership and revenue, NFL ratings are down. The recent political †controversies surrounding the sport have been nothing but bad news for fans, players and owners across the country. In contrast to these issues, the NBA and its players have procured a huge growth in interest worldwide. The NBA will surpass the NFL as America's most popular sport within the next five years. When it comes to modern-day popularity contests, the first place to look is social media clout. The NFL Network and NBArank of ESPN both recently came out with a list of the top 100 players for 2018. The top 10 NFL stars on the list have an accumulated 14.4 million followers on Instagram, with Tom Brady having the most on the list at 4.2 million followers. The top 10 ranked NBA players, on the other hand, have a staggering 107 million instagram followers in total. LeBron James himself has nearly three times the amount of followers as the top 10 NFL superstars combined. In a culture full of icons and celebrities, the NBA simply has more enticing characters that the fans want to keep up to date with. The enormous margin between the NFL and NBA on social media attests to the idea that fans already find basketball to be their favorite sport. NBA players have created personal brands that allow the fans to be more connected to the game, and because of that the blue checks are stacking up enormously compared to the media presence of NFL stars. Heck, J.R. Smith's Hennessy memes and Carmelo Anthony's hoodie are getting more air time on the internet than NFL stars nowadays. The future of all entertainment is in the development of social media, and the NBA is clearly dominating that sector. Perhaps the biggest problem leading to the NFL's demise is the prevalence of not only season-ending injuries but also life-ending injuries. Repetitive brain trauma has been proven to result in violent mood swings, depression and many other cognitive difficulties. Aaron Hernandez, a former tight-end for the New England Patriots, was convicted for the murder of Odin Lloyd and eventually hung himself in prison at the age of 27 years old. He had severe and late stages of CTE in his brain. His family is now suing the Patriots and the NFL on the grounds that they ""úwere fully aware of the damage that could be inflicted from repetitive impact injuries and failed to disclose, treat or protect him from the dangers of such damage.""ù Brain damage of players in the NFL is an epidemic, one that will take away from the game in a multitude of ways. One of the medical pioneers of CTE, Dr. Bennet Omalu, spoke with NFL personnel who told him, ""úIf 10 percent of mothers in this country would perceive football as a dangerous sport, that is the end of football.""ù Even now we see that former players are speaking out against their kids playing the game, such as Troy Aikman, who was quoted on HBO saying: ""úIf I had a 10-year-old boy, I don't know that I'd be real inclined to encourage him to go play football, in light of what we are learning from head injury.""ù In response to this health crisis, the NFL has altered the rules of the game significantly over the years, but this in itself is a problem. More penalties slow the flow of the game, alter the outcome in a non-competitive way and eliminate the intrinsic excitement of violence in the fans' and players' beloved game. In the NBA, the worst injuries in recent history were those of Gordon Hayward or Shaun Livingston, who are both back on the court ready to compete for a championship this upcoming season with little to no lifelong damage to their bodies. Many of those concerned for the health of their son or daughter are going to be more than willing to put them on a basketball court and extremely fearful of letting them get hit on the football field. In a world that is becoming increasingly less tolerant and less attracted to violence, basketball is becoming the most viable athletic option for both the families and the players. Let's face it, this country is dedicated to the people who are getting paid, and NBA players are getting paid by the likes of which we have never seen before. In Forbes' list of the top 100 richest athletes in the world, there are 40 NBA players and just a mere 16 who represent the NFL. Not only are contracts for playing basketball at an all-time high, but NBA players are also signing much larger endorsements. This means they have become significantly more valuable to companies' public image and ability to sell products due to their popularity. In 2018, LeBron James will receive $52 million and Steph Curry will pull in $42 million from endorsements. This is more than they will make from their basketball contracts. The top endorsed NFL players are Drew Brees with $11 million and Eli Manning with $8 million ""î a fraction of what NBA superstars are making annually. The brand image of NBA players have hit an all-time high because the popularity of basketball is increasing rapidly worldwide. Even when Madden 2018 was being advertised this past year, they used NBA players James Harden and Chris Paul in the commercial promoting it. Oh, and according to Forbes, ""úNBA 2k18""ù just hit a new record of over 10 million copies sold, ranking it the number seven bestselling game of the year, whereas ""úMadden""ù didn't even make the top 10. Companies are utilizing this newfound popularity to boost their company's sales and are leaving NFL players out because they aren't what's ""úhot""ù right now. NBA players are taking business into their own hands as well, as seen in the pinnacle of business-minded athletes such as Michael Jordan, who is worth $1.4 billion and is now the world's richest athlete ever. Basketball players are not just playing sports; they are creating companies and becoming ubiquitous in corporate advertising""î all of which promote the status of the NBA. NBA players are redefining pop culture in a way that the NFL is not. Politically, the NBA has always been at the forefront of progressive ideas, whether it be the Golden State Warriors boycotting the White House visit, LeBron James's infamous tweet toward Trump or the countless philanthropic charities and donations made by players all over the league. The NFL, on the other hand, has refused to give roster slots to Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid for ""ústanding""ù up against police brutality, yet it continues to provide careers for countless players charged with sexual assault, domestic violence and DUIs. NBA players also stay active in the entertainment industry outside of basketball, from the newest collaboration of Dame Dolla and Lil Wayne to Kyrie Irving's new movie ""úUncle Drew""ù to even more serious ventures like LeBron James's new docuseries called ""úShut Up and Dribble.""ù They are constantly using their charismatic personalities to enter other fields of the entertainment industry, and this trend is only going upwards from here. Fashion is probably the most influenced by NBA players as well. Brands like Jordan, Nike and Adidas all flock to NBA stars to push athletic gear off their shelves. Even Lavar Ball's antics have allowed Big Baller Brand to reach a cult following in the fashion industry globally. After all, when's the last time you bought anything from Tom Brady's brand? You haven't. Basketball players have always held a fun-loving stereotype, which has left us with stylish shoes, hilarious memes, countless rap songs and, most importantly, strong role models. The NFL sells itself as a logo and rarely contributes to life outside of the realm of football. If I had to invest in one of them, I would put my money into the NBA every time.

sports,Gauchos Drop First Conference Game 1-0 to Sac. State,4-Oct-18,5:10 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/gauchos-drop-first-conference-game-1-0-to-sac-state/,"Nexus File Photo The UCSB men's soccer team delivered an underwhelming Big West debut, dropping their second match in a row on Wednesday against Sacramento State during their NorCal tour. The rocky start is reflective of the poor on-the-road performance ""î captured by the 1-5 record ""î †that has so far been the pitfall of the otherwise undefeated group. Though the Gauchos' 6-5 overall record still peaks just above the .500 mark, their conference record now sits at 0-1. Equal in total games, their competitors, the Sac State Hornets, fall far below SB, sporting a statistically unthreatening record of 3-6-2. Their defeat over UCSB in game 11 marked their first shutout since their third game back in August. Nonetheless, Santa Barbara succumbed to the vicious away-game losing cycle in the 79th minute when Sac State's Matt Carnefix launched a low ball into the net for the only goal of the game ""î his first of the season. Freshman forward Benji Kikanovic stole a deflection off of the foot of SB's Faouzi Taieb, allowing him to break away toward the center of the field. Kikanovic found Carnefix undefended on the far side of the box and executed a routine pass to instigate the goal. It was perhaps here that the UCSB roster missed goalie Ben Roach the most. Roach received a red card in the Gauchos' last match against Cal Poly; this was the freshman's first time not defending the net since the onset of the season. Standing in his place for his own seasonal debut was sophomore Alan Carillo. Despite the singular goal, Carillo appeared experienced and in control guarding the net. He tallied five saves in total, the most threatening one occurring almost immediately after Sac State scored. On the opposing side, rookie Ryan Curtis started his first collegiate game and matched Carillo with a career-high five saves on the night. The Hornets' goal, though the ultimate mark of defeat, refreshed what seemed like one of Santa Barbara's slowest games this season. The Gauchos failed to tally even one shot over the course of the first half, an unfamiliar statistic previously unseen amid their 2018 record. The second half, however, took a much different ""î yet, similarly unproductive ""î tone. UCSB's offense began their attack immediately following the starting whistle, taking 12 shots from the 46th minute up until the final two minutes of the game. With just under seven minutes left in the game, the frontmen of SB's roster made six final attempts at finding a last-minute equalizer, two of them being rips on goal. The Gauchos now seek redemption as they travel down the coast and back to their untainted territory in Santa Barbara. UCSB remains undefeated on home turf, a record the roster will not let slip out of their hands easily. Gearing up to take on Cal State Fullerton, Santa Barbara must find a way to break through their two-game offensive stagnancy especially while facing Fullerton's standout goalie Paul-Andre Guerin, who was named this week's Big West Defensive Player of the Week. The Titans come into Saturday's matchup with a lackluster 4-2-6 record, however, they have gained some steam heading into conference play with two wins against LMU and USF and a tie against CSUN. Their offense has been spearheaded by seniors Samuel Goni and Ross McPhie, with the former leading the team in goals (4) and the latter leading the squad in assists (4). This juxtaposition between the more experienced and tactical front line of the Titans and the youthful attack of the Gauchos should lead to an enticing clash of play styles, and hopefully a lot of goals. The Cal State Fullerton Titans threaten Harder Stadium and our winning record this Saturday at 7 p.m. for the second game of Big West conference play.

sports,"Gauchos Get Back on Track with win over CSUN, prepare for Hawaii",4-Oct-18,5:04 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/gauchos-get-back-on-track-with-win-over-csun-prepare-for-hawaii/,"After a serve, Emilia Petrachi kneels to pass the ball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's volleyball team got off to a great start this week, as they were able to make quick work against the Cal State Northridge Matadors with a 5-10 win in straight sets on Tuesday night. This win came on the heel of a grueling five-set loss against UC Davis on Saturday. UCSB was led by Big West Defensive Player of the Week Emilia Petrachi, along with Big West Player of the Week Lindsey Ruddins. Petrachi led the defense with a team-high of 15 digs, while Ruddins≠ ""î once again ""î led all players with a match-high 17 kills. The Gauchos, who started their night with an 11-6 overall record and 3-2 record in Big West play, were looking to avenge their last tough loss to UC Davis in the previous weekend. The first set was highly competitive, as Northridge held a slight lead earlier in the game before UCSB tied it up with a score of 10-10. The two squads then alternated leads for the rest of the set, until a late run by the Gauchos set up a 25-20 first-set victory. In the second set, Santa Barbara started out hot, growing its lead by as much as eight points at several different junctures in the match. The Gauchos held a comfortable 19-11 lead after a kill by Charlie Robinson, and it seemed as if they were about to pull away until a plethora of serve errors and attack errors by UCSB sparked a 9-0 run by the Matadors, which allowed them to retake the lead 20-19. From that point on, the two teams alternated points until two clutch aces by Lindsey Ruddins put the set away with a score of 27-25. The third set did not contain nearly as much drama as the second. In this set, the Gauchos jumped out to an early lead and refused to relinquish their power, extending the lead to double digits early on and finishing off Northridge with a score of 25-12. This win improved the UCSB women's record to 12-6 overall, improving their conference record to a solid 4-2, an instrumental win in climbing the ranks to third place in the Big West. One of the teams that the Gauchos trail behind in the Big West standings is their next opponent, the 8-5 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors, who currently sport an excellent 4-0 conference record. This match carries significant importance for the Gauchos because, if they are able to pull off the win at home this Friday versus Hawaii, it will show the rest of the Big West players that they belong at the top of the conference among the other elite teams. If UCSB wants a chance to beat Hawaii, it is going to have to slow down talented libero ""úTita""ù Akiu ""î who leads her team with 4.79 digs/set ""î as well as the scoring trio McKenna Granato, Norene Iosia and Casey Castillo, all of whom average over 2.3 kills/set. Aside from the usual contributors (Ruddins and Petrachi), other players (like middle blocker Charlie Robinson and setter Olivia Lovenberg) have caught fire at a great time in the season and have contributed greatly to UCSB's success so far. These outside contributors must continue their stellar play as the Gauchos embark on a difficult stretch of games in the thick of conference play. UCSB is 6-38 all-time against the Rainbow Wahine, with a current streak of nine straight losses to Hawaii. This next home match would be a perfect time to break that losing streak and show the rest of the Big West that the Gauchos are the real deal. The match versus Hawaii will take place at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 5, in the Thunderdome.

To open up the new campaign, No.7 UCSB will be hosting No. 17 San Jose State this week. The Gauchos are currently coming off of back to back losses to No. 4 Stanford and No. 1 USC, which explains Santa Barbara's recent falling out of top 5 in the rankings. For the most part, September has been kind as the team is currently standing at an overall record of 12-5; however, those 5 losses have been to only top 5 programs. This means that the squad will have to return to their winning ways, beginning with this week's opponent, and have their calendars marked for those NCAA-ranked matchups later on in the season. As for the Spartans, who are currently 4-4 on the year, they have just recently dropped out of the nation's top 15 and will see this away game as a means of returning to form. San Jose State is also coming off back to back losses after falling short to No. 3 Cal and No. 4 Stanford; the latter had them defeated 3-16, whereas UCSB kept it much closer at 7-9. Historically, the UCSB vs. San Jose State series has been a closely contested one as the Gauchos lead by only 12-11; last year the series went 2-1 in favor of the Gauchos, who dropped the conference matchup but claimed the postseason win. Both teams will hope to improve, when it comes to Golden Coast Conference play, considering the Gauchos finished in 5th place and the Spartans ended dead last; both with 1-4 conference records. The remaining programs that share the conference are all top 12 in NCAA rankings: Pacific, Long Beach State, Pepperdine, and UC Irvine. A player to watch for the Gauchos is number 10 Boris Jovanovic. This senior driver is the goal leader with 50 to his name already. He also has a team-leading 107 shots, so the offense will surely revolve around his ability to produce regularly. In Sunday's contest against the Trojans, Jovanovic was prevented from scoring. Smothering the Gauchos' primary scoring option proved to be an effective strategy for the No. 1 team in the nation, as USC held UCSB to just 2 goals. The Gauchos' supporting cast will have to give better performances if opponents follow the Trojans' example of containing Jovanovic, which seems likely. Regardless, Santa Barbara is still more than capable of finding the net through its other weapons. Another name to keep track of is number 9 Ivan Gvodanovic. The junior utility is one of the several playmakers on the team and leader in assists with 14 on the season. Look for these two to link up plenty come game time. UCSB's national ranking and impressive roster proves to be a promising glimpse of what's left in store for Men's Water Polo. With only 5 total conference meets and another invitational next weekend, expectations for the Gauchos will be set very high. UCSB will host San Jose State this Friday, Oct. 5th, at 4 p.m. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the October 4th, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,UCSB Looks to Build Off First Big West Victory,4-Oct-18,5:05 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-04/ucsb-looks-to-build-off-first-big-west-victory/,"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus Sitting on a perfect 1-0 conference record, the UCSB women's soccer team will hope to preserve its unbeaten mark as it heads on the road for two away matches this weekend first against UC Irvine, then against UC Riverside. Both matches will prove to be a great gauge to show just what this Santa Barbara team, currently 8-4 overall, is made up of all three of the teams mentioned are tied for first place in the Big West standings with a 1-0 mark. Currently, UCR has the best overall record of the bunch sitting at 10-0-1 on the year while UCI is just 5-5-1 overall on the year, but has had an arguably tougher schedule with three of its losses coming against Pac-12 schools including a 1-0 loss to No. 12 USC. This season, UCSB has earned a 3-2 record away from home ""î 5-2 if you count neutral site matches ""î but has struggled against UC Irvine in recent memory losing against its Big West foe the past two seasons including a tough 4-1 loss last year in Santa Barbara. If the Gauchos want to earn a win at UC Irvine, something the program has not accomplished since the 2005 season, then they will need to rely on offensive star Shaelan Murrison. UCSB's junior forward/midfielder is the Big West's leading point-getter with 18 on the season thanks in part to seven goals and four assists, the former being a team-high mark as well. Murrison has struggled recently, however, tallying just one assist and no scores in the last four games including going 0-17 in that same time span. Still, the Gauchos know that if the game gets close they can trust her as she does have three game-winners this season. Additionally, UCSB will look to rely on juniors Mallory Hrmatko and Lynsee Voss. Hrmatko, a former Big West freshman of the year, leads the team in assists with five and always has the offense playing a high pace. She also is great on the defensive side of things as she did earn a Big West Defensive Player of the Week for the week of August 27th. Voss, a transfer from the University of San Diego a couple of seasons ago, recently earned her first Big West Offensive Player of the Week following her game-winning goal against UC Davis last season. She currently has two goals in her Gaucho career. In order to fully secure a win against UCI then UCSB will also need to shut down its top contributors. Sophomore Claire Grouwinkel has been the ""òEaters top offensive player with five goals on the season. Four of her five scores have been tallied in just the last three matches. Winners of four of their last five, UC Irvine also managed a big win to kick off conference play last week defeating Hawai'i in double overtime thanks to a game-winning goal from Reema Bzeih. The goal, along with helping the team pitch a shutout, helped the sophomore earn Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors. Win or lose, however, UCSB will definitely need to be prepared for Sunday's match against UC Riverside. Currently, the only undefeated team left in the conference, UCR has steamrolled its opponents outscoring them 15-2. Riverside's two goals allowed is by far the best mark in the conference as UCSB's 12 goals allowed is tied for second best. Its goals-against average (.194) is also the best in the entire country comprised of 333 D-I schools. This is thanks in part to Annie Bailey. The redshirt junior keeper has been tremendous in her nine starts allowing just the two aforementioned goals but also tallying 34 saves. The Highlanders offense has mostly run through senior midfielder Madeline Feist who has had a tremendous season currently leading the team in points (17), goals (7) and assists (3). Her seven goals are tied with UCSB's Murrison for most in the Big West. Additionally, Feist has scored in each of the last two contests, including a game-winner against the University of Denver a few weeks ago. This weekend will be very telling for UCSB. The Gauchos have missed the tournament the last two seasons despite a great start in non-conference play. Before the big win against UC Davis, Santa Barbara had lost three of its last four and looked like it was tail-spinning heading into league. This weekend will show whether they truly have corrected their issues or will expose them against the much stiffer competition they are slated to face. UCSB will take on UC Irvine at 7 p.m. on Friday, October 5 at Anteater Stadium. It will then face off against UC Riverside at 5 p.m. on Sunday, October 7 at the UC Riverside Soccer Stadium.

Once the dust settled both teams had 16 shots with nine on goal for the home team and seven for the visitors. For much of the first half, the two teams were deadlocked. In the 15th minute, the Gauchos had a free kick from outside the box but were unable to do anything with it. In the 18th, UCI put a shot on goal but junior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese made one of her seven saves on the night to keep the score deadlocked at 0-0. Finally, in the 38th minute, UC Irvine broke the score open as Elizabeth Hutchison delivered a nice, high cross into the box which senior midfielder Shelby Lee converted into her first goal of the season. The ""òEaters would take the 1-0 lead into halftime. Coming out of the break, UCSB was firing on all cylinders offensively. In the 48th minute, junior forward Shaelan Murison tallied her eighth goal of the year to tie the game at 1-1. Murison, who came into the game having made none of her last seventeen shots, scored her first goal since September 14th. She is the team's leading scorer by six goals. After that, the rest of the second half would be as tough as the first with both teams trading shot on goals but each goalie making great saves to keep their†teams in the game. DeWeese made a notable save in the 66th minute stopping a strong header. Junior ""òEater goalkeeper Maddie Newsom also had a heck of a game tallying six saves on the evening and moving into fourth all-time in program history for most saves in a career. Her fifth save in the 86th minute was perhaps the biggest of the ball game setting up overtime. In the extra period, again the teams traded shots. Murison missed one high in the 93rd. The teams would head to a second portion. That is when UCI's†Pottorff became a hero for her team. Newsom, on a free kick from around midfield, booted the ball into the box. The ball bounced past a UCI head and then Pottorff tracked it on the bounce and knocked it past DeWeese into the net giving her team the 2-1 win. Kelsee Pottorff with her first career goal and the game winner! #RipEm #instantreplay pic.twitter.com/IZcToxAjY3 ""î UCI W Soccer (@UCIwsoc) October 6, 2018  It was the senior's first goal of her entire career and it was an important one as not only did it help win the game, but it now keeps UC Irvine in the driver's seat in the conference. For UCSB, Friday's heartbreaking loss will not be an easy thing to shake off, but considering its next match is against the undefeated Highlanders at UC Riverside, it really does not have a choice. One conference loss is not the end of the world, but if the Gauchos can't dig deep and upset the Highlanders then they may be in some trouble heading into the rest of their league schedule. Sometimes the best way to get over a tough loss is to get back out on the pitch as soon as possible. Maybe that will help UCSB. It better, considering they face the Highlanders in less than 48 hours. UCSB takes on UC Riverside at 5 p.m. on Sunday, October 7th at UC Riverside Soccer Stadium.

sports,UCSB Loses War of Attrition to Rainbow Wahine,6-Oct-18,5:24 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-06/ucsb-loses-war-of-attrition-to-rainbow-wahine/,"Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus On Friday night the UCSB Gauchos took on the Hawai'i Rainbow Wahine in an arduous five-set match that ultimately finished with Hawai'i as the victor. With the loss, UCSB falls to 12-7 overall, and 4-3 in the Big West, while Hawai'i improves to 9-6 overall and 5-1 in conference play. Redshirt junior Lindsey Ruddins again led the way for Santa Barbara as she finished with 16 kills and 11 digs and sophomore Rowan Ennis followed that up with 12 kills and 4 digs of her own. Junior outside hitter Torre Glasker was another key contributor in Friday's match as she totaled 5 kills and 13 digs of her own to add to the cause. Freshmen Olivia Lovenberg and Zoe Fleck also tallied 9 digs apiece in the loss. The low hitting percentage by UCSB (.081) and Hawai'i (.138) shows the important role defense played in the outcome of this one. The defensive tone for the match was set by the senior libero Emilia Petrachi as she totaled a game-high 29 digs that proved to be massively important in such a tight match. Hawaii was able to match the defensive output of UCSB with the help of Tita Akiu's 26 digs and McKenna Granato's 16 kills and 14 digs. Those two senior leaders for Hawai'i made the most noise on the floor for the Rainbow Wahine as their efforts were barely enough to scrape by the pesky Gauchos in five sets. The game got off to a rough start for both squads as there were 22 combined errors in the first set, and the teams jostled for the lead throughout the game until UCSB managed to pull away late to take the first victory by a score of 25-19. The second set was not as tightly contested as Hawai'i got off to an early lead and held on to win 25-14 and even the series to one game apiece. The third set was controlled early by the Gauchos as they held as much as a six point lead and were looking to pull away from Hawaii. But then a trio of service and attack errors by UCSB let visiting Hawai'i get right back into the game. The third set was tightly contested as each team alternated leads until the Rainbow Wahine scored the final five points of the set to give themselves a 2-1 lead in the series. After a devastating loss in the third set the Gauchos could have laid down and accepted defeat from a superior team, but they instead bounced back in the fourth set and handily defeated Hawaii 25-19. This win ensured a decisive fifth set to 15 points to determine who would leave victorious. The experienced Rainbow Wahine proved too much in the deciding set, however, as they jumped out to an early 8-2 lead and never looked back, finishing off the Gauchos 15-10 in the fifth set. Every loss hurts but many positives can be taken from this match moving forward and coach Lantagne Welch's squad definitely proved that they can compete with the top dogs in the Big West.

sports,Golden Goal Lifts Gauchos Past Titans in Crucial Conference Match,7-Oct-18,5:31 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-07/golden-goal-lifts-gauchos-past-titans-in-crucial-conference-match/,"Kavian Kashani looks up the field to pass. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Heading into overtime against Cal State Fullerton, the UCSB men's soccer team had little to be inspired by. For the third straight game, the team had failed to score during regulation.  In total, 270 straight minutes ticked by as Santa Barbara remained without a goal. Having lost their conference opener to Sacramento State, the Gauchos knew that anything short of a victory would put their hopes of a Big West title in serious jeopardy. Junior Noah Billingsley was not willing to let that happen.  Billingsley sprinted up the left wing, running perfectly onto a cut-back pass from freshman Carter Clemmensen. After receiving the pass, he coolly slotted the ball to the bottom left corner of the net, sending the 1500 fans at Harder Stadium into a frenzy as the team celebrated a much-needed victory. ""úMy main thing was I didn't want to sky the shot,""ù Billingsley said. ""úIt was a huge relief for me to score my first goal of the season, especially in overtime.""ù While the Gauchos may have struggled at offense on times, a victory is nonetheless huge for Santa Barbara, pushing the Gauchos to 7-5 on the season and 1-1 in conference play. Now; however, they must go on the road to face both Riverside and Irvine: two huge conference games. So far this season, Santa Barbara is merely 1-5 on the road. Once Billingsley knocked the shot in through the back of the next, the Gauchos team was relieved, especially after a relatively nondescript 90 minutes of soccer. Heading into the game, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg opted to tinker with the 3-5-2 formation he had deployed most of the season, moving to a more traditional back four.  Vom Steeg also decided to give both junior Mate Restrepo-Mejia and sophomore William Gillingham their first starts of the season in a desperate attempt to kick-start a team that had looked lifeless in the past week. ""úWe wanted to be physical and bigger today,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úI'm not stubborn enough to where I knew we needed to change something after so many 1-0 losses""ù. Perhaps most surprisingly, Vom Steeg also moved star sophomore, Rodney Michael. Previously, Michael had served as a striker""ìleading the team with six goals""ì but Vom Steeg wanted to give Michael more freedom on the ball. ""úIt's obvious that Michael up front will have three players on him at all times,""ù he said. ""úI was also sick of our team just hitting long balls to him and hoping that he would score. We wanted to put him in a position where he could take defenders on.""ù For much of the night, Michael struggled in that role. Without direct service, Michael was forced to play much deeper to get involved with the team's build-up play. On the goal, however, Michael made his presence felt, picking up the ball on the right wing and cutting past two defenders before finding Clemmensen at the top of the box, who then played the pass to Billingsley. Fullerton struggled to cope with the changes UCSB made. In the second half, the Titans played deep in their own half, seemingly hoping for a draw on the road. More often than not, they were bailed out by their keeper, senior Paul-Andre Guerin. Officially, Guerin only recorded four saves; serving as a sweeper-keeper, however, Guerin came out to punch a multitude of dangerous crosses that easily could have been goals against inferior goalies. ""úI think it was really unfortunate that we didn't score on a set-piece tonight because we had three or four good chances where we could have scored,""ù Vom Steeg. Despite dominating possession, the Gauchos once again struggled to create tangible chances from open play. While Clemmensen and junior Ignacio Tellechea offered solid hold-up play up front, both struggled on their long-range shots. Once again, UCSB was bailed out by its backline""ì in particular, the center-back duo of junior Faouzi Taieb and Hunter Ashworth. Winning seemingly every aerial ball, the two of them mitigated nearly every opportunity that Fullerton created. ""úI thought we had the right approach tonight and played to our strengths,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úNow, we need what we did tonight to carry over to Wednesday's match at Riverside.""ù UCSB will take on UC Riverside at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, October 10th at UC Riverside Soccer Stadium.

sports,Unbeaten No More: Gauchos Hand Riverside First Loss of Season,8-Oct-18,9:15 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-08/unbeaten-no-more-gauchos-hand-riverside-first-loss-of-season/,"Amaya Zabalza gets the ball around an opposing player. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus In the midst of the most important road stretch of the 2018-19 season, the Gauchos pulled off a dramatic late goal to beat the Highlanders 1-0 and hand the first place team its sole loss of the year. UC Riverside dropped to 10-1-2 overall, 1-1-1 in Big West play on Sunday evening as the Gauchos bested an unbeaten Highlanders squad that was a heavily touted favorite entering the match. UCSB improved to 9-5 overall and 2-1 in conference play to take over the second place spot in the Big West standings while Riverside slid down the rankings to drop to No. 4 in the conference. Heading into the match, the Highlanders were one of four teams that had remained unbeaten throughout this season. Riverside got off to a confident start as it peppered shots early, forcing junior Hanna DeWeese to make a lengthy save in the 12th minute to keep the game deadlocked at zero goals a piece. ""úThey started in the system that we expected, and then they made a very quick change that took us by surprise a little bit,""ù Head Coach Paul Stumpf said. ""úThis surface, it's old, it's very bouncy""¶it's a hard place to play soccer, so we had to make an adjustment to our style a little bit as well.""ù Of the seven shots that Riverside took in the first half, only one of them was on target. While the Highlanders bested UCSB on the offensive end, Santa Barbara matched its defensive intensity by not letting UCR get high percentage shots in the first half. With game tied at 0-0 heading into the second half, once again Riverside came out firing as it blasted three shots within the first five minutes. Yet for a team that thrives in crunch time during half number two, the Highlanders were limited to just those three looks for the remainder of the entire second half until the final three minutes.  ""úI think they took most of their shots in the first 15 or 20 minutes,""ù Stumpf said. ""úOnce we made our adjustments and clamped down, their looks kind of evaporated""¶I do think once we made our adjustments in our system, the game changed dramatically.""ù The second half was dominated by the Gaucho attack as Santa Barbara fired eight shots at the goal, four of which were on target. Following a shot that sailed high from freshman standout Jessica Wright, Gaucho senior midfielder Jessica Clegg reentered the game for the final push from UCSB in the closing 10 minute frame.  Clegg flew down the sideline looking to make an immediate impact in the 84th minute. With a quick feed into the box, senior captain Shaelan Murison received the ball with space and fired off a strike into the bottom right-hand corner of the net to give the Gauchos a late 1-0 lead over the unbeaten Highlanders. ""úWe finally put our goal scorer in a position were she could get a decent look at the goal with a little bit of time and space. She maximized her opportunity""¶she had to put the ball into a corner with a good bit of pace, no doubt about it,""ù Stumpf said regarding the knockout punch from Murison. Riverside managed to fire off a last-ditch attempt in the 87th minute, but the shot drifted high as the Gauchos became the first team this season to knock off the Highlanders who are unbeaten no more. The finale of the 3-game road trip will take place next Sunday as the Gauchos travel to Cal State Long Beach to take on a 6-4-2 , 1-0-1 squad that looks to make a move up in the standings.

sports,Athlete Spotlight: Sophomore Guard Devearl Ramsey,11-Oct-18,5:05 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/athlete-spotlight-sophomore-guard-devearl-ramsey/," Basketball practice in the Thunderdome is filled with an array of sounds. From the squeak of shoes on the hardwood to the rattle of a missed jump shot, no sound is louder than that of sophomore point guard Devearl Ramsey controlling his offense. Ramsey has yet to play a game in the Gaucho blue, but his leadership role resembles a composed veteran teammate. The sophomore guard spent last year on the sidelines nursing a stress fracture as a redshirt after he made the move from the University of Nevada to Santa Barbara. ""úLast year I tried to watch what the guys were doing and see where I could fit in, how I could make my impact,""ù Ramsey recalled about his transition. ""úWhen I was [recruited] here, Coach P. talked to me a lot about how the offense ran ""¶ coming out to play with these guys, we all feel like we have a chip on our shoulders and we all just want to be the best.""ù Ramsey headlines a myriad of Gaucho transfers this season, including graduate Alabama guard Ar'mond Davis and former Oregon State point guard JaQuori McLaughlin. Coach Joe Pasternack, now on his second season with the team, has made a significant shift in the program's recruiting tactics with a greater emphasis on bringing in transfer students. When Pasternack took over after the 2016-17 season, only one player on the roster was a transfer recruit while the rest of the team was noticeably young. Pasternack rostered three transfers in his first year, all of whom played a significant role in the 16-win turnaround season following an abysmal 2016. Now in Pasternack's second year, the Gauchos sport five transfer athletes on their roster, which is now composed of an abundance of experienced veteran players. ""úHe really just wants the best from you; he's really detailed oriented,""ù Ramsey said with a grin. ""ú[Pasternack] has some of the qualities that the USA coaches had ""¶ I feel like he's getting the best out of all of us and he's doing a great job.""ù Devearl Ramsey is no stranger to successful basketball programs. Ramsey played high school ball at Sierra Canyon located in Los Angeles, Calif., ranking No. 5 in California and No. 21 nationwide in his final year. During his sophomore and junior seasons, the point guard was a gold medalist. Ramsey won the FIBA Under-17 World Cup while playing on the same team as Jayson Tatum, Marvin Bagley III and Josh Jackson. ""úPeople like that, they always work hard. They make you want to get in the gym, too; you guys push each other,""ù Ramsey said. ""úIt's been great working out with Marvin, he works out with my brother ""¶ I've been in the gym with a lot of guys like that; it's good to go at each other.""ù Battling back from an injury last season, Devearl zoned in on what aspects of his game could develop with his time off. His older brother Earl works as a trainer in Los Angeles, and together they made significant strides forward during his redshirt year. ""úMy brother is like my right hand ""¶ he's the reason I went and started playing basketball. He's been with me every step of the way,""ù Ramsey expressed about his recent training focus. ""úOnce I started being able to play, I began working on my jump shot ""¶ I feel like I've really improved my jump shot.""ù Heading into his first season as a Gaucho, the sophomore has high expectations for the offense under Coach Pasternack. His transition has been somewhat seamless, and now that the point guard is at 100 percent physically, UCSB will run its high-powered attack through Devearl Ramsey. Expect to hear Ramsey's voice commanding the floor come game time ""î it'll be the loudest noise on the court.

sports,Gauchos Head South To Battle First-Place UCI,11-Oct-18,7:00 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/gauchos-head-south-to-battle-first-place-uci/,"Nexus File Photo Nobody expected UC Irvine to snag first place in the Big West at any point in the 2018 season. The Anteaters finished fifth in the conference this season and, historically, were thought to have a weak soccer program. After back-to-back convincing victories against UC Riverside and Sacramento State, Irvine currently owns full possession of first place, opening up conference play 2-0 for the first time since 2010. While the Anteaters entered conference play with a solid 6-4-1 record, they failed to record any resume-building victories in nonconference play, as their most impressive performance was a nail-biting 1-0 loss to (now) No. 7 Saint Mary's. Their fast start in conference play has taken on even more significance with the new single-table format of the conference, in which teams only face each other once in conference play. The new format makes this game nearly must-win for the Gauchos, who made it back to .500 in the conference after knocking off Cal State Fullerton in overtime. After that game, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg discussed the need for the team to play better on the road, with only a 1-5 record away from Harder Stadium this season. ""úWe need to do a better job on the road of outworking the opponent and playing bigger,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úWe want what we did against Fullerton to carry over to our road games this week.""ù The biggest issue for the Gauchos this season has been finding goals: In the last three games, they have failed to score in regulation. Outside of sophomore Rodney Michael (6), junior Faouzi Taieb (3) and freshman Carter Clemmenson (2), no Gauchos have scored more than a single goal all season, allowing defenses to key in on Michael. To counteract this, Vom Steeg moved Michael from forward to right midfield, where he has more of an opportunity to attack and beat defenders. Even when the team was rapidly scoring earlier in the season, it struggled to create goals from open play. Look for junior Axel Mendez and senior Joseph Ammer to try to thread more through passes from the midfield to kick-start the offense this week. Santa Barbara will have to pull off the upset shorthanded, however, as sophomore Carson Vom Steeg will likely be forced to sit due to a knock he picked up in the Sacramento State match. Sophomore William Gillingham, who slotted in admirably for the midfielder in the last game, will likely once again be asked to step in. While Gillingham doesn't provide the passing skills of Vom Steeg, his strength and size should help the Gauchos play a physical game. For Irvine, the clear standout is junior forward Jose Ortiz, who already has seven goals and two assists to his name this year. Out of the midfield, sophomore Alvaro Quesada leads the Big West with six assists, with the next closest player in the conference only at four. These two, along with five goals from junior forward Ivan Canales, have created an incredibly efficient offense that has bagged nearly two goals per game. On the defensive end, Irvine has given up less than one goal per game, with the backline spearheaded by junior keeper Greg Patenaude, who has recorded 41 saves this season. With a balanced defense and a fiery offense, Irvine will prove a tough test for the Gauchos. Santa Barbara currently leads the all-time series against Irvine, totaling a 37-17-5 record against the Anteaters. They will be looking for their first win against UC Irvine since 2016, when they defeated them 1-0 at Harder Stadium. The Gauchos will take on UC Irvine at Crawford Stadium on Saturday at 7 p.m. A version of this story appeared on page 6 in the Oct. 11 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Ride High Heading Towards Long Beach,11-Oct-18,7:14 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/gauchos-ride-high-heading-towards-long-beach/,"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus Following a dramatic late goal that propelled the UCSB women's soccer team over UC Riverside to hand the Highlanders their first loss of the season, the women's soccer team is back in action Sunday as it takes on Long Beach State on the road. Long Beach's rollercoaster season has led them to a 6-4-2 overall record while the 49ers have a 1-0-1 record in Big West play. Beach resides in the fifth spot of the Big West standings while UCSB is a daunting matchup for any team it faces. The Gauchos remain in the No. 2 spot in the conference, but last weeks win against formerly unbeaten Riverside propelled them into a contending spot. The Gauchos had high expectations heading into league play and the first three games have diminished any doubt about this team's legitimacy. In his twentieth year with Santa Barbara, Head Coach Paul Stumpf has put a major emphasis and clarity on the goals he has set for the Gauchos this year. ""úThere are eight conference games and we've got to win four. Four wins and twelve points has gotten teams into the Big West Tournament,""ù remarked Coach Stumpf when discussing his game plan for conference matchups. Santa Barbara has two wins and six points in the standings from three conference matchups and is already halfway closer to Stumpf's four-win goal to get into the Big West Tournament. The squad nearly swept its first three conference games, but it lost a 2-1 nail biter to UC Irvine in double overtime. Much of that success is accredited to junior Captain Shaelan Murison who leads the Big West with 9 goals and 22 overall points, including one that came in the 84th minute to hand UC Riverside its first lost of the season. Murison quarterbacks this Gaucho offense from the wing as she tops out the Big West with 4.14 shots per game. On top of that, the junior is tied for second in the conference in assists with 4 on the year, solely behind her fellow teammate, senior midfielder Mallory Hromatko who champions the Big West in her passing with 6 assists of her own. On the road this season, the Gauchos have a 4-3 record heading into their match with Long Beach State. This will be the finale of their recent 3-game road trip as the ""òChos went 1-1 in the first two games over the away stretch. Although the 49ers reside in the middle of the Big West Standings early on during conference play, this team has faced some stout competition early on in the year. Projected as the No. 2 team in the Big West preseason rankings, Beach has played four top-25 ranked opponents, including suffering shutout losses to both No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 USC. Yet for a team that has played such prominent talent this season, the Niners thrive at home. Long Beach boasts a 4-1-1 home record on the year and looks to remain sturdy while facing an imposing Gauchos squad. Senior midfielder Dana Fujikuni leads the charge for the Niners with 4 goals and 3 assists on the year. Fujikuni is accurate on her strikes as 64.7% of her shots are on target. She is dangerous in crunch time as well with a game-winner against San Diego State during non-conference play. The Gauchos (9-5, 2-1) travel to Long Beach (6-4-2, 1-0-1) on Sunday evening Santa Barbara looks to power through another prominent Big West foe to remain keen on a Big West Championship.

sports,Late Penalty Kick Solidifies Gauchos' Loss to UC Riverside,11-Oct-18,7:06 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/late-penalty-kick-solidifies-gauchos-loss-to-uc-riverside/,"Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus A reoccurring nightmare seems like the most appropriate way to term away games for the UCSB men's soccer team. Dropping their latest match to UC Riverside on unfamiliar turf, the Gauchos have now suffered four 1-0 losses in a row while on the road. A lack of offensive pressure, execution and a consequent reliance on their backline once again characterized the close-to habitual loss against a competitor that, in most respects, was all too beatable. While the Highlanders relish in their 2-1-0 Big West record, the Gauchos watch theirs drop to 1-2-0. A dull and scoreless first half led the two competitors into a chippy second half. The teams ended the game fist-to-fist in a brawl instigated in the last eight seconds of the game. Riverside's powerhouse forward Daniel Aguirre broke the standstill in the 75th minute following a foul called in the box against UCSB. The sophomore caught freshman keeper Ben roach going the wrong way in a one-on-one penalty kick goal; this was Aguirre's fifth of the season. The first half played out much too familiarly for Santa Barbara. Set up in a 4-4-2 formation, the Gauchos failed to capitalize on the few scoring opportunities they created for themselves, sending in just one shot against the Highlanders. Their offense could not get a solid hold of the field, seldom making it into the 6-yard box, and rather losing possession almost immediately after moving the ball to the forward line. Forward Ignacio Tellechea, unfortunately, saw this plenty of times over the opening 45 minutes as he controlled long balls and attempted to carry them up the field, only to find his teammates lagging far beneath him, unable to pressure the defense any further. Several lapses in the backline during the first 45 also foreshadowed the looming loss. Santa Barbara's defense consistently left too much space for their opponents to play through the middle and locate each other with ease. The Highlanders threatened the Gauchos with six shots by the end of the half, two of them calling for difficult saves from goalie Ben Roach. Aguirre asserted himself from the get-go, carrying out strong attacks on the opposing backline. In the 20th minute, the sophomore found a gap in the Gaucho defense and launched a dangerously low and powerful shot that was then saved by Roach. Fellow frontman Antonio Lakossou was responsible for the Highlanders' next notable threat just five minutes later when his header off of UCR's first corner kick fell just wide of the left post. Frustrated and eager to put a number on the board, the teams took a more physical approach to their gameplay; 14 fouls, 6 yellow cards, and 2 red cards later""îagain, in just the second half""î the match bordered on chaotic. UCSB amped up their offense a bit, adding four more shots to their scorebook. The closest the Gauchos got to scoring came at the foot of Rodney Michael in the last five minutes of the game. Despite being double-teamed by the competitor's backline, the sophomore stud blasted a shot straight into keeper Edwin Gutierrez's chest. Santa Barbara did not offer any more offensive threats after this. Having faced one another four times in the past two years, the bad blood finally revealed itself in a fight that broke out between players less than five minutes later in front of the Riverside bench. The Gauchos hardly have time to dwell on the loss, however. While it has a relatively secure spot in the Big West Tournament, Santa Barbara cannot afford to lose its upcoming games if it wants a chance at hosting the tournament matchups at Harder Stadium later on. The turnaround begins with UC Irvine on Saturday, Oct. 13 at 7 p.m. Irvine is currently undefeated and, more significantly, coming off a huge win against #25 UC Davis from this past Wednesday.

sports,Men's Water Polo Travels to Stanford for MPSF Tournament,11-Oct-18,6:59 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/mens-water-polo-travels-to-stanford-for-spmf-tournament/,"Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus An action-packed weekend is in store for the Men's Water Polo team as the Gauchos head north, to Stanford, where the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation invitational is set to take place. This weekend-long tournament features a total of 16 programs, 13 of which are nationally ranked sides in NCAA polls. UCSB has fared well at the MPSF invitational in recent years and will be looking to put up another dominant performance after last year's perfect 4-0 showing versus opponents. Competition commences Friday, as No. 5 UCSB will take on No. 15 Pomona-Pitzer for their first matchup of the invitational. UCSB recently earned their spot in the NCAA's top-5 standings following last week's winning efforts versus San Jose State; climbing past a pair of organizations from their previous No. 7 slot. Coming off their most recent 14-6 conference win against the Spartans, the Gauchos now hold a 13-5 record on the year. As for their last five matchups, they've gone 3-2, however, those couple of losses have only been to top-3 programs; both of which are also competing in the same tournament this weekend hosts No.1 Stanford and No. 3 USC. As for Pomona-Pitzer, they are standing at a 12-4 overall for the season. The Sagehens are currently building upon a 3-game win streak, with their latest meet being a 19-7 rout over their conference opponent Cal Tech. Pomona-Pitzer has just enough points the place them in the top-15 of NCAA programs and have not slid from their, previous to the polls' update, ranking of No. 15. Players to keep an eye on for the Gauchos are utility junior Ivan Gvozdanovic and sophomore attacker Spencer Wood. With a team-leading 15 total assists this season, Gvozdanovic is coming off a great showing from his last game where he earned 2 goals, an assist, and a steal. Wood had a similarly exciting performance last time out, where he scored a goal and earned a pair of assists to his name; he also played a crucial role in closing out the game when called upon. With several games to be expected for the Gauchos, plenty of squad rotations will take place as these two players will be crucial to the offense's production. Historically, UCSB Men's Water Polo has been dominant against Pomona-Pitzer's program. So much so that the Gauchos boast a perfect 14-0 record versus the Sagehens, with their previous victory occurring at last year's Inland Empire Tournament where they won by a score of 13-8. Day 1 of the MPSF invitational takes place this Friday, as UCSB and Pomona-Pitzer will face off at 5:30 PM, in Stanford's Belardi Pool. Tournament arrangements have the winner of this matchup playing the winner of Game 5, on Saturday, at 9:20 AM; whilst the matchup's loser plays Game 5's loser, simultaneously.

sports,UCSB Women's Volleyball Starts Road Trip at Cal Poly,11-Oct-18,5:02 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-11/ucsb-womens-volleyball-starts-road-trip-at-cal-poly/,"Lindsey Ruddins jump-serves to her opponent. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus There's one team to beat in the Big West this year, and it's the Cal Poly women's volleyball team. Sitting at 16-1 overall and 6-0 in the conference, the No. 12 ranked Mustangs have rocketed out to one of their best starts in program history. On Friday night, the UCSB women's volleyball team will get its chance to come at the queens of the conference in the Blue-Green rivalry matchup in San Luis Obispo. The Gauchos, at 12-7 and 4-3, won't be favored, but they'll certainly be motivated to finally bring the Mustangs down. The conditions are mostly right for UCSB to have a chance at the upset. The Gauchos have had a full week of preparation and are coming off of both a strong sweep of CSUN last Tuesday and a hard-fought 3-2 loss to Hawaii on Friday. The latter match, while a loss, should embolden the Gauchos when it comes to their ability to hang with the Big West powerhouses. Hawaii is just a step behind Cal Poly in the standings at 9-6 overall and 5-1 in the conference, with that one loss at the hands of the Mustangs last Saturday. Any additional confidence UCSB can take into their Friday match will be a help against one of the nation's highest ranked programs. Cal Poly is working on a 15-game win streak and has dropped only one set across their six Big West matches so far. Facing a juggernaut like the Mustangs, taking even a set on Friday night would be an accomplishment for the Gauchos. To take the match, UCSB will likely have to play better than it has all season. Such a performance starts at the top, with star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins. The powerhouse of the team, Ruddins is second in the nation in kills per set with 5.39 and boasts a career-best .271 hitting percentage. Cal Poly is largely unique among Big West programs in that they have a counter to Ruddins. Junior outside hitter Torrey Van Winden's 5.07 kills per set is sixth-best in the nation, and her .369 hitting percentage is tops in the Big West. She's both powerful and precise, and a pain to stop as a result. It might be a pain but stopping or limiting Van Winden is a key to victory against the Mustangs. Van Winden had her worst match of the season against Pitt in Cal Poly's lone loss, hitting just .108 and mustering 3.25 kills per set, her second worst mark of the year. It will be a good sign for the Gauchos if they're even in a position where they need to stop Van Winden. Throughout Big West play, the junior has had somewhat sparing usage in the Mustang attack, taking on more of the attacking load only when necessary, like with her 64 attacks and 29 kills against Hawaii. Cal Poly's other attackers, such as Torrey's older sister, Adlee, have handled more of the attacking function in the team's other Big West matches. UCSB's task defensively will be to neutralize those attackers and then neutralize Torrey Van Winden, something no team other than No. 6 Pitt has been able to do all year. UCSB has shown it can put in the work on defense so far in the Big West, which will be essential when it comes to stopping that Mustang attack. The Gauchos lead the Big West in digs per set with 18.50, best by over a full dig. Blocking hasn't been quite as much of a strong suit, so the team will have to rely on that digging process to respond to Cal Poly's strikes. Offensively, UCSB will have to continue to show off some of its newfound balance. The Gauchos boast four different players with over two kills per set, with Ruddins, her sister Gigi, Torre Glasker and middle blocker Charlie Robinson comprising the list. That continued versatility is crucial to any chance of Gaucho success in the Blue-Green rivalry. Without it, the Mustangs will be able to key in on Ruddins, greatly simplifying their defensive responsibilities. There's a lot that needs to go right for UCSB to even have a chance of scratching the first blemish into Cal Poly's Big West record. That's to be expected when taking on No. 12 team in the nation, one that hasn't lost a match since August and has dropped just four sets since the start of September. If the Gauchos manage to dig their way out from under the Cal Poly attack and keep the Mustangs on their back heel with a varied attack of their own, they'll be putting themselves in position to come back from San Luis Obispo with a season-defining win. That's what it takes to stop a stampede. Comments are closed.

sports,"UCSB Ends Scoring Difficulties on the Road, Ties Irvine 2-2",14-Oct-18,11:28 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-14/ucsb-ends-scoring-difficulties-on-the-road-ties-irvine-2-2/,"File Photo / Daily Nexus UCSB men's soccer finally ended its scoring drought; however, the Gauchos will have to settle for a 2-2 tie against the Anteaters as overtime saw neither team take an advantage.  When UC Irvine doubled their lead in the 62nd minute ""î the result of an errant pass out of the back by keeper Ben Roach ""î †the Gauchos had hit rock bottom. Entering the match in sixth place in the Big West Conference, Santa Barbara knew they needed a result to keep their season afloat ""î no easy task considering they were taking on the first-place Anteaters on the road. Having only tallied two road goals all season, UCSB seemed all but dead in the water. But as the age-old sports aphorism goes, a team only shows its true colors in the face of adversity. Entering the match, Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg had said the team was treating the game as if it were a playoff match. True to his word, the team fought for all 90 minutes, with junior Hunter Ashworth netting a goal in the 71st minute and sophomore Carson Vom Steeg scoring the equalizer in the 76th minute. After a fruitless overtime period, the Santa Barbara players collapsed on the pitch, content with the vital point they had picked up on the road. Entering the match, the Gauchos had been desperate to find consistent offense, with the team failing to score in 10 consecutive regulation halves. After they dropped Wednesday's match to a lowly Riverside squad, one wondered what mentality the embattled team would come out with. To the Gauchos' credit, the team came out with an incredibly positive start. Vom Steeg had once again tinkered with the formation to try to manufacture offense, moving junior forward Ignacio Tellechea to left mid and bringing captain Jan Ilskens up front as the lone striker. Kaya Fabretti and Sahid Conteh also slotted into the midfield, in the hope that the two would use their poise and pace to control the central part of the field. The plan worked to perfection, with Tellechea causing havoc on the left wing all night long, putting in threatening cross after threatening cross. In the eighth minute, those persistent crosses paid off when the ball struck an Irvine defender in the hand. When the referee pointed to the spot, star sophomore forward Rodney Michael stepped up to take it, beating the keeper but striking the inside of the left post and bouncing away harmlessly. Four minutes later, UC Irvine would take advantage of a set piece of its own. After winning a free kick outside of the box near the end line, captain Daniel Crisostomo curled an absolute screamer to the back post, easily over the outstretched hand of Roach to give the Anteaters a 1-0 lead. The Gauchos continued to dominate the run of play in the rest of the first half and beginning of the second half, but per the trend all season the team just couldn't seem to find the elusive goal. Too often, Ilskens was isolated up top with no real service. The team looked the most dangerous with either junior Noah Billingsley or Michael running at defenders, but even on those opportunities, the end product was lacking. On the other side, most of Irvine's opportunities were coming on the counterattack, but Santa Barbara's defenders had ensured they couldn't create any tangible chances, knowing that a 2-0 road deficit against the top team in the conference would be fatal. When Roach made that giveaway in the 62nd minute ""î a mistake that allowed Ivan Canales a one-on-one that he easily slotted home ""î it seemed to be the end of the Gauchos' chances. The team was also without Tim Vom Steeg, who had picked up his second yellow card early in the second half. On this night, the team refused to quit. In the 72nd minute, off another good ball from Tellechea, Michael deflected the ball toward the back post, where Ashworth could easily tap in the ball to cut the lead in half. All of a sudden, Santa Barbara had life. Merely minutes later, Michael beat a defender down the right wing, sending a cross into the box that skimmed past the outstretched hand of the keeper and onto the incoming run of Carson Vom Steeg, who tied the score 2-2. Neither team was able to create many chances the rest of the game, although Michael did have two potential moves for UCSB in overtime. In the first overtime period, he nearly missed the back post with a curling effort from the left side. In the second overtime period, he ran behind the defense, but great positioning from the Irvine keeper cut off his angle. Despite the great comeback effort, the Gauchos still find themselves in a precarious situation. Currently, on four points through four conference games, Santa Barbara would be on the outside looking in if the conference were to start today. With their next three matches at home, where they are unbeaten this season, the Gauchos will hope they can capitalize on the momentum they created tonight. UCSB returns to Harder Stadium on Wednesday, where it will take on a ranked UC Davis squad at 7 p.m.

sports,Women's Volleyball Falls to No. 12 Cal Poly on the Road,14-Oct-18,11:13 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-14/womens-volleyball-falls-to-no-12-cal-poly-on-the-road/,"Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus † The UCSB women's volleyball team was handed a difficult loss at the hands of No. 12 Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo on Friday night, dropping the Gauchos' record to 12-8 overall and 4-4 in the Big West. They put up a respectable fight against the rival Mustangs but ultimately ended up falling to one of the best offensive teams in the country in three sets. This is Santa Barbara's second straight loss, following a difficult five-set defeat to Hawaii a week prior. The Gauchos again relied on star junior outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins for the bulk of the offense as she tallied a game-high 18 kills. Freshman setter Olivia Lovenberg also played an important role in this one as she finished with 38 assists, a mark that led both teams. UCSB also got contributions from junior Torre Glasker, who recorded 9 kills and 12 digs, as well as senior Emilia Petrachi with 12 digs. The Mustangs, riding a 15-game winning streak, came into the game as one of the hottest teams in the country and were paced by freshman Meredith Phillips and junior Torrey Van Winden. Phillips finished with 12 kills and Van Winden finished with 10 as those two lead the way offensively. Katherine Brouker and Avalon DeNecochea also contributed to the Mustang's win by setting the defensive tone as they combined for 31 digs. The first set got off to a competitive start as teams alternated points early and UCSB trailed by a score of 6-7. An attack error by Ruddins then sparked a run of eight straight points by the Mustangs, extending their lead to 15-6. Cal Poly did not relinquish the lead from that point and held on to take the first set 25-14. The second set started similarly to the first, as teams traded points early until Cal Poly was able to establish a 15-9 lead midway through. However, the Gauchos showed resilience and fought back against the Mustangs' onslaught and closed the gap to one point several times. A late kill by Torre Glasker made the score 22-23 in favor of the Mustangs, and the momentum had shifted back in the Gauchos' favor until a pair of errors by UCSB ended the set and gave Cal Poly a 25-22 win. Up two sets to none, the Mustangs got off to another hot start in the third set and again built up an early lead, this time by a score of 15-8. Even with things looking bleak, †the Gauchos battled back and showed their heart when they cut the lead to four and trailed 23-19. In the end, they proved to be overmatched by Cal Poly and fell by a final score of 25-19 as the Mustangs took all three sets on their home floor. The loss keeps UCSB in fourth place in the Big West standings at 4-4 with eight matches left to play. Losing a rivalry game is almost always a disappointment, but the hope is that facing a nationally ranked team such as Cal Poly will allow the Gauchos to better understand their weaknesses and work to improve their strengths along the final stretch of Big West play. The Gauchos will continue their season-long four-game road trip as they travel to Long Beach State on Friday, Oct. 19, at 7 p.m. and follow that with a match at Cal State Northridge on Saturday, Oct. 20, also at 7 p.m.

sports,Gauchos Head North for Pair of Road Games,18-Oct-18,5:35 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/gauchos-head-north-for-pair-of-road-games/,"Boris Jovanovic searches for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus Another weekend full of action is in store for the men's water polo team as a doubleheader is in the cards.
First, the Gauchos return to Golden Coast Conference play this Saturday with a road matchup against third-place Pacific. Then on Sunday, UCSB will travel up to familiar foe Cal for their third meeting this year. UCSB will look to build upon its dominance in October, as the team is currently 4-1 in this month alone. This season, the Gauchos hold a 16-6 overall record with all their losses coming only from teams who are ranked higher than them in the NCAA standings. This next pair of matches will be a great indicator for how far exactly the team has progressed and whether or not they've got what it takes to make that leap to join the top three nationally ranked programs.
The Pacific Tigers are teetering just above a .500 as they find themselves at an overall of 8-7 for the year. In October, they are 3-2 and are most recently coming off a split showing of 2-2 after last weekend's MPSF tournament. This will be the second time Pacific and UCSB have encountered each other this season, with the last confrontation ending in a closely fought 13-11 Gaucho victory. Historically, the Gauchos are 74-29 when facing Pacific. Dependent on how Pepperdine fares against UC Irvine, this Gauchos and Tigers clash will decide who will be sitting in first place in the GCC standings. UCSB, Pacific and Pepperdine are currently in a three-team tie for the top GCC spot after each side won its opening conference match. As for the Cal Bears, this non-conference matchup will feature just as much intensity, as the Gauchos will have another rematch opportunity in order to finally best their Northern opponents. The Golden Bears are at an impressive 14-3 overall this year and are coming off back-to-back losses against No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 USC. Cal is also undefeated at home, whereas UCSB is 14-4 when on the road or at a neutral venue. On the season, UCSB is 0-2 against Cal and will be searching for the upset win. Not much is different historically either as Cal has an imposing all-time series lead of 68-8, with UCSB's last series victory occurring all the way back in 2004.
Snagging victories in both games of this doubleheader will give the Gauchos all the momentum to close out their conference strong, as the NCAA Tournament is also set for next month. Both opponents were also present at the most recent MPSF Invitational. Pacific ended in seventh-place and Cal took the bronze, as compared to UCSB's fifth-place finish. Through the tournament, the Gauchos are undefeated against Golden Coast Conference opponents. Saturday's conference match against Pacific is set to take place away from home at 1 p.m. Sunday's exhibition game versus Cal will also be on the road, taking place in Berkeley at 12 p.m. A version of this story appeared on pg. 8 of the Oct. 18 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Look to Keep Perfect Home Record Alive,18-Oct-18,5:20 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/gauchos-look-to-keep-perfect-home-record-alive/,"Rodney Michael pushes the ball past defenders. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's soccer team's early season struggles have put them in a precarious situation. With only two games to go, the Gauchos, touted as potential conference contenders this season, currently find themselves tied for sixth place in the conference with a 8-6-1 record. With only six teams making the Big West tournament, every point matters for Santa Barbara. Things certainly don't get any easier on Saturday, when CSUN comes to town. Ranked 44th in the nation in RPI, the Matadors are currently second in the conference with seven points. Northridge has multiple key wins on its resume, including an away win over then No. 17 UCLA, a 3-0 thumping of No. 15 UC Davis and a 3-1 victory over No. 17 Cornell. CSUN's only conference loss so far came against Sacramento State, a shocking 2-1 defeat in Sacramento that once again underscores how wide open the conference is this year. Northridge comes in to the match with momentum on its side, having knocked off Cal Poly in its last conference matche. Pretty much all of the Matadors' offense runs through forward Daniel Trejo, who has notched an incredible nine goals already this season, including the winner against Cal Poly. On the season, Trejo already has three game-winning goals to his name. Working on the Gauchos' side has been their ability to shut down opposing teams' star players. Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has touted time and time again the contributions from center backs Hunter Ashworth and Faouzi Taieb when marking the opposing team's best player. Against UCLA, the two completely frustrated star freshman Matt Hundley and have yet to allow an opposing striker to score more than one goal against them this season. Outside of Trejo, Northridge has a fairly balanced attack, with eight other players on the score sheet this season. Keeper Henrik Regitnig has run a solid backline as well, picking up 49 saves and four clean sheets already this year. Similarly to the Gauchos, CSUN has fared much better at home than on the road this season. With a 5-1 home record and 3-4-1 away record, the Matadors may have a tough time adjusting to the hostile environment that Harder Stadium is notorious for. While their road struggles have been well-documented, Santa Barbara has been dominant at home, still unbeaten after seven home games. The Gauchos have also been a much stronger offensive team at home, having scored 13 of their 17 goals. As has been the trend most of the season, the team will rely on star forward Rodney Michael to manufacture the team's offense. Although he hasn't scored in the last five matches, Michael picked up both assists in the crucial draw against Irvine and has netted six goals this season. Playing from the right wing, Michael will be the focal point of the attack. Despite their struggle for consistency up front, the Gauchos have been bolstered as of late by their reshuffled midfield, led by sophomores Carson Vom Steeg and Sahid Conteh. Vom Steeg, a transfer from Stanford, has dealt with leg injuries throughout the entire season, but he had perhaps his finest performance last Saturday when he scored the tying goal against Irvine. After being dropped from the starting lineup, Conteh has inserted himself into the fold once again as a starter after a series of stellar performances. Conteh's elite pace allows him to patrol the midfield defensively as well as make runs up the field and serve as an outlet to the other attackers. Anything less than a victory on Saturday would leave Santa Barbara in a perilous position, potentially putting it on the outside looking in for a key to the Big West Tournament. With only a rivalry game against Cal Poly left on the schedule, the Gauchos desperately need a result against Daniel Trejo and the Matadors. The game will kick off on Saturday at Harder Stadium at 7 p.m. A version of this story appeared on page 8 of the Oct. 18 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,In Defense of Jimmy Butler,18-Oct-18,5:05 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/in-defense-of-jimmy-butler/,"Tinna Lam/ Daily Nexus With the NBA season set to begin this Tuesday, there are plenty of storylines that are dominating the news already, starting with Jimmy Butler's outburst in practice. During the Timberwolves practice session, Jimmy was seen calling out teammates, coaches, as well as Minnesota's General Manager Scott Layden. To the basketball world, Butler is seen as a poised and collected player with a strong IQ for the game. Moreover, he is labeled as a leader that acts as the glue that keeps the team together. Quite frankly, he is the last person that anyone would expect to belittle his teammates, which means there must be valid reasons for doing so. Throughout his seven year career, Butler has worked tirelessly to put himself in the conversation of the best players in the league. After four straight years of not only being a lockdown defender but also averaging over 20 points per game, it seemed only fitting that he be offered a hefty contract by the team that had not made the playoffs for 14 years until he had arrived. As contract talks stalled, Butler clearly felt betrayed as he mentioned in an interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols. ""úIt's about saying we need you. We want you here. We can't do this without you,""ù, he explained. ""úAnd that was the disconnect all along. You're saying one thing. I mean I've learned enough times in life that saying something is completely different than acting upon it.""ù Although this quote explains his frustration with management, it does not bring to light why he was frustrated with his teammates. Butler would later explain this in the same interview when asked if he felt his teammates did not have winning as their top priority. ""úIf your No. 1 priority isn't winning, and people can tell? That's the battle,""ù† he explains. ""úNow, there's a problem between people because that guy's No. 1 priority is winning and that guy's isn't. Of course they're gonna clash, like, ""òI'm doing this for the team. Are you?' ""òEhh.' Exactly. So, that's where the disconnect is.""ù Before Butler became a Timberwolf, it was very clear that Minnesota was underachieving as they had two number one picks on the same roster, in Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins, yet they could not break into the top eight spots in the Western Conference. Minnesota wanted Butler to change the culture in the locker room to where there was an expectation to win but it seems apparent now that not everyone on the team has bought into that culture. The dispute between Butler and the organization does not seem to be coming to an end anytime soon as Butler has made it very clear that he wants to be traded immediately. To some, it may be comprehended as him quitting on the team, but that could not be farther from the truth. If Butler could take the third stringers and beat the starters in a scrimmage during practice, it is apparent that winning is not a top priority for the players on the team. With Butler turning 30 this year, his years for competing for championships and continuing to play at a high level are numbered. For him, he simply does not want to waste his best years on a team that does not have the same desire to compete as he does. As the Timberwolves face the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night, it will be interesting to see the dynamic between not only Butler and his teammates but also Butler and the coaching staff as well. Perhaps, this lights a fire under his teammates and this becomes the year Minnesota finally lives up to their potential. More likely however, Jimmy Butler will be traded and Minnesota will fall back to being a middle of the pack team in the West.

sports,Major Off-Season Storylines,18-Oct-18,5:15 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/major-off-season-storylines/,"Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus Kawhi Leonard's Journey One of the strangest situations of a player forcing his way off a team happened in the case of Kawhi Leonard last year in San Antonio.  We will probably never know if he was really unable to play at the end of last season or if he was just holding out to show his desire to be traded. Add in the drama of a superstar-for-superstar trade to Toronto for DeMar Derozan and this situation gets even more interesting.  With one year left on his deal, Leonard could possibly leave Toronto after this season, leaving us subject to a whole year of anonymous and likely unsubstantiated reports claiming to know Kawhi's intentions in free agency. Prepare yourself for Paul George in Oklahoma City part two with Kawhi in Toronto ""î maybe Magic Johnson will find a new way to get caught tampering this time around. The Jimmy Butler Saga Looking at the Jimmy Butler situation in Minnesota feels like driving past a car accident: You worry for the people involved, but you still slow down to make sure you get a good look at the carnage.  This whole fiasco has been great theater for anyone not involved with the Timberwolves, but we do have to keep in mind that Jimmy Butler will actually be playing basketball on an NBA court instead of making headlines off of it. The T'Wolves still do not have a trade partner for Butler, and every day that he is in Minnesota, his trade value goes down, putting more and more pressure on management to get a deal done.  The baggage that Butler has accumulated over the past few weeks is going to follow him wherever he goes, and it will be interesting to see if another team takes the bait and trades for him and his massive ego. LeBron James to the Lakers After suffering through a full year of media theorizing and reports from unnamed sources, LeBron James finally put us all out of our misery after he signed a four-year $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers on the first day of free agency last summer.  The Lakers also raised some eyebrows when they followed the signing of James by adding a few questionable characters, such as Lance Stephenson, Javale McGee, Michael Beasley and Rajon Rondo, all on one-year deals. They are going to have to work through some kinks as a team while they let Coach Luke Walton figure out how to turn this wacky personnel group into a functioning contender with LeBron at the helm. We have yet to see a LeBron James team not devolve into him playing iso-ball with four shooters standing around waiting for the ball to come to them, but this roster is built differently from any team LeBron has played for in the past, filled with both vets and young players.  The athletes on the Lakers this year could allow James to play with a faster pace and play more off-ball, which he has expressed a desire to do in the past. Whatever the fate of the 2018-19 Lakers turns out to be, the evolution and drama of this team will be fascinating. Demarcus Cousins to Golden State Maybe the most unexpected move of the offseason was the already loaded Golden State Warriors adding another All-NBA player in DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year $5.3 million contract. The small-scale deal shocked the basketball world as Cousins decided to turn down possible max offers from other teams in favor of a one-year rental with the reigning NBA champs.  The situation regarding Cousin's free agency is unique considering he suffered a torn achilles tendon midway through last season, and his current status for when he will return is up in the air.  Even if his recovery takes longer than expected, the presence of an all-star center adds a brand new weapon to arguably the most dominant team in NBA history and also makes up for the personality void left by the departure of Nick Young and Javale McGee.  †A version of this story appeared on page 9 of the Oct. 18 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,New-Look Raptors and Celtics Look to Dominate East,18-Oct-18,5:09 AM,['Andrew Strauss'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/new-look-raptors-and-celtics-look-to-dominate-east/,"Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus Well, it's official ""î the best time of the year is coming. The leaves change colors (at least in other states), Thanksgiving and winter break are right around the corner and, of course, a new NBA season is about to begin. If that's not something to get excited about, I don't know what is. Although we will probably get another Warriors title championship this year, that doesn't mean we're going to be like Eric Bledsoe at a barbershop and want to leave for greener pastures. There are a lot of interesting possibilities this year, and here are three situations to keep an eye on. Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors††† The last time we saw Kawhi Leonard play, he was a top MVP candidate, someone who looked like he was about to dominate the league offensively while allowing approximately zero points to be scored on him. However, that was a long time ago, and perceptions change. After taking a year off to recover from a mysterious quad injury that forced the Spurs to trade him, he was dealt to the Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan. All we know about him so far in Toronto is that he is a fun guy who will probably never pass for a normal person. However, his fit with Toronto could be amazing. If he returns to MVP form, a team that was already a great defense with DeRozan, who seems to enjoy when people dribble by him, could end up being the top defense in the league. Pair that with the addition of Danny Green, a 3-and-D specialist who was also acquired in the San Antonio trade, and they could have a great offense built around Kawhi. They still have a fantastic bench unit as well as Kyle Lowry, the NBA version of a bulldog. They could put out a small ball unit that absolutely terrorizes teams on defense and can force favorable mismatches on offense. This is all assuming that Kawhi returns to pre-injury form, but if he does, a team with the best regular season record in the East last year could be much better. The Celtics and Chemistry Issues On paper, the Celtics are one of the best teams, if not the very best, in the East. Last year, missing two All-Stars, they were one Lebron James away from being in the NBA Finals. This year, Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward both return, and both are reportedly in good health. The question is how they will be able to manage the demands of individual players. No other team besides the Warriors has as much talent throughout the lineup as the Celtics, and the Warriors are the rare team that can combine talent and unselfishness to make dynastic level talent work out. The last time we saw the Celtics, Terry Rozier was being very scary, Jayson Tatum was the primary scorer and Jaylen Brown was the second in command on the wing. This year, however, with as many wing scorers as they have combined with the touches Kyrie will have, it will be interesting to see if they can keep all the talent happy enough to stay together. Al Horford will still put together an underrated season built on passing, spacing the floor and rebounding, †but how the rest of the lineup will interact with each other remains to be seen. Brad Stevens does have a great coaching record so far, but he's never had a complete season coaching this talented of a team, and it will be interesting to see how he uses all the pieces he has been given. LeBron and the Playoffs††††††††  The last time LeBron James didn't make the playoffs was 2005. Just for points of reference, I had just started kindergarten and the first iPhone came out in 2007. We've come to just expect LeBron to be in the playoffs, partly because of his transcendent talent and partly because of his residence in the inferior Eastern Conference. Moving to the Lakers has made the inevitability of seeing LeBron in the playoffs thrown into question. LeBron's signing of a four-year deal signaled that he thought championship aspirations were not feasible this year, but the playoffs are a different story. In order to get into the playoffs, we can look at the bottom of the Western Conference and go from there. The Timberwolves made it last year, but with all the Jimmy Butler drama, I wouldn't be surprised in the least if they take a fall in the wins column this year. That really leaves the Nuggets and the Spurs for the Lakers to overcome in order to clinch a playoff berth. Even though the Nuggets are good and only getting better with a young core centered around savant Nikola Jokic, and even though the Spurs have not missed the playoffs since before the turn of the century, it still feels like something has to give. If I had to take a guess, the Nuggets are probably going to be moved down a spot. The Spurs got the seventh seed last year with Kawhi not playing, which makes the addition of DeMar DeRozan a huge improvement. Even with the Lakers' young core and a veteran group that feels like it would be more at home in a comedy than on a basketball court, expect to see LeBron in the playoffs this year.

sports,The Ultimate Buy-Low: The Sacramento Kings,18-Oct-18,5:01 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/the-ultimate-buy-low-the-sacramento-kings/,"Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus If you're an NBA fan living in California and looking for a team to support, you have only one respectable option. Choosing to root for the Golden State Warriors or the Los Angeles Lakers is boring and morally questionable. You know you're going to get success and a playoff run, as well as a title for the Warriors. Also, everyone hates you. The Los Angeles Clippers are a goofy team with an interesting history of failure as well as limited and unfulfilling success, but they're still not that compelling of an option. They're also going to try and import max free agents next summer, a black mark on any self-respecting NBA fan's soul. This leaves us with the Sacramento Kings, the NBA's ultimate buy-low opportunity. There's no ground floor lower than 12 years of no playoff appearances and constant mockery by other fans, analysts and even players. It can't get worse than it already is, probably. In fact, it's likely going to get better. After years of depressing dead-end rosters, the Kings finally have a team of exciting young talent. Second-year point guard De'Aaron Fox, possibly the quickest player in the NBA, got a jump shot in the offseason and looked like a real-life point guard in preseason. The Kings haven't had one of those since they traded Isaiah Thomas for Alex Oriakhi, who currently plays in Mexico. Marvin Bagley III was the No. 2 pick of the 2018 NBA draft and could be a franchise big man with his incredible bounce and touch around the rim. He can't really use his right hand on offense and is so bad at defense that Duke had to revamp its entire system for him, but it was definitely still smart to pick Bagley over Luka Doncic, 19-year-old reigning Euroleague MVP. The sleeper young talent, however, is Harry Giles. The 20th pick of the 2017 NBA draft, Giles was the top-rated high school player in a recruiting class that included Jayson Tatum and Lonzo Ball, but multiple knee surgeries on both knees cut his sole season at Duke short and pushed him down in the draft. The Kings played it safe last season and kept Giles on the shelf all year, but news came out around the All-Star Break that he was dominating practices. We've seen him play in Summer League and preseason now, and he's lived up to the hype. He's still athletic with ball skills and a point guard's passing vision, all of which are reasons he was billed as a new-age Chris Webber in high school. He's got a jump shot, too, which means he's a ball-handling seven-footer who can rebound, pass] and knock down threes. He's also a pretty good defender, if you're into that. A quick heads up: When you become a Kings fan, you also have to become a devout Harry Giles apostle. You'll notice every Kings fan online is devoted to spreading the word of Giles. He's that good, and we also haven't had a reason to hope for so long. Fox, Bagley and Giles make for a good young core, along with a supporting cast of players like Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Frank Mason. The team won't be good this year, but they'll certainly be fun and interesting to watch. Speaking of which, I should mention how bad they're going to be this year. It's important to me that you know what you're signing up for as a Sacramento Kings fan. They're going to be the worst or second worst team in the Western Conference and one of the five worst teams in the league.  Comments are closed.

sports,UCSB Heads Into Weekend With Must-Win Mentality as Conference Play Nears End,18-Oct-18,5:30 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/ucsb-heads-into-weekend-with-must-win-mentality-as-conference-play-nears-end/,"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus Four games remain in the Big West season and, currently, there is a three-way tie for the fourth and final playoff spot. Amongst these teams is the UCSB women's soccer squad, a team that will play three of its final four matches of the season at home. As a whole, Santa Barbara is a tough team to pin down. The Gauchos boast a 9-6 overall mark, 2-2 in league ""î Tied with both Hawai'i and CSUN who UCSB has yet to face ""î but it seems like every time they turn a corner, they cannot get that big win. Two weeks ago, UCSB handed UC Riverside its first loss of the entire year besting them 1-0 at the Highlanders home stadium, but last week, the Gauchos lost 1-0 at Long Beach State. Playing at Long Beach is by no means easy, but a win shows that this team is capable of running the table. That being said, Santa Barbara still has four games played over two weeks to not only secure a playoff spot, but also show why it is a dangerous team. That will begin with Friday's match as UCSB hosts last place Cal State Fullerton. CSUF comes into town with just a few wins on the year sitting at 3-10-2 overall, 0-3-1 in league play. For Santa Barbara, this game could not have come at a better time as a much-needed win would be great for them as the battle for playoff positioning continues. Of course, in order for UCSB to even pull off the win, it will need to rely heavily on forward Shaelan Murison. Right now, Muison is still the league's leader in goals (9), points (22) and shots (62). The junior has also scored in two of her last three contests but will look to bounce back from an 0-4 performance against the 49ers last season. Assisting her on the offensive side of the ball will be senior Mallory Hrmatko whose six assists on the year lead the entire Big West Conference. The midfielder also makes a great impact on defense as she has won a Big West Player of the Week award for her performance on that side of the ball this season. As a whole, UCSB will need to rely on its offense if it hopes to win. In games where the Gauchos have been held to just one or zero scores, they are 1-5 on the year and have been shutout in four of those six contests. Facing CSUF, UCSB will likely find it a bit easier to score than against other opponents. Currently, the Titans have allowed the second most goals per game at 1.61. Additionally, in its four conference games, CSUF has allowed eight goals. Still, no win is easy and if the Titans hope to pick up their first win of conference play then they will need to rely on senior Nano Oronoz whose five goals on the year leads the team. Other key contributers will need to be freshman Kristen Swales who has four goals on the year but also junior Atlanta Primus who is top 10 in the league in assists (3) and goals (4). While Santa Barbara's offense will be the key factor in Friday's match, Sunday's match against Hawai'i will be the exact opposite. Currently, Hawai'i is 7-5-1 overall on the year and 2-2 in conference. The Rainbow Wahine have scored seven goals in just the four conference matches, the most in the Big West while also having done it efficiently earning a .159 shooting percentage another league best. Leading Hawai'i has been senior duo Raisa Strom-Okimoto and Leialoha Medeiros who have combined to score 15 goals on the of the teams total 23 scores on the year. Sunday's match also elicits even more intrigue as both squads have beaten UC Davis and lost in double overtime to UC Irvine showing just how evenly matched they are. Regardless of how the year has gone, UCSB has four games to prove it belongs. The past two years has been filled with missed opportunities, and if they don't want to make it a fourth, the Gauchos need not just one but two wins this weekend. UCSB will take on CSUF at 7 p.m. on Friday, October 19 at Harder Stadium. Santa Barbara will then host Hawai'i at 5 p.m. on Sunday, October 21.

sports,"UCSB Volleyball Faces LBSU, CSUN",18-Oct-18,5:25 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-18/ucsb-volleyball-faces-lbsu-csun/,"Nexus File Photo Members of the UCSB women's volleyball team are in the midst of their longest road trip of the season, and they have an opportunity to gain some momentum over the weekend after dropping their last two matches. They are coming off a pair of difficult losses against Cal Poly and Hawai'i, who are currently number one and two in the Big West standings. However, this weekend of games provides a great opportunity to jump up in the conference standings against two teams the Gauchos have already bested once before this season. The first game of the weekend will take place on Friday, Oct. 19, in the Walter Pyramid against the Long Beach State 49ers. The 49ers are in fifth place in Big West play at 3-4, and they will go up against Cal State Fullerton tonight in an attempt to even their record with the 4-4 Gauchos. With only eight matches left for UCSB, this one will have major implications in the conference standings as we approach the home stretch of the season. The 49ers are headed by junior Hailey Harward, who leads her team with an average of 2.60 kills per set and 2.92 digs per set on the defensive side for this season, and ranks second on the team in that category. UCSB counters the dangerous Harward with the even more dangerous Lindsey Ruddins and her Big West-leading 5.42 kills per set this season to set the tone on the offense for the Gauchos as she makes her case for another All-Big West season. Another interesting matchup to look out for in this one is between the two talented freshmen setters, Olivia Lovenberg for Santa Barbara and Carly Aigner-Swesey for Long Beach. Lovenberg leads the Big West in assists per set with 11.14, and Aigner-Swesey is not far behind in fifth place, with an average of 7.97 assists per set. The Gauchos look to sweep the season series against the 49ers after taking their only previous meeting in late September.
The next match will be played in the Matadome on the campus of Cal State Northridge, where the Gauchos will look to defeat the Matadors on their home floor. The last time the two teams faced each other in Santa Barbara, the Gauchos made quick work of CSUN and swept them in three sets. Northridge is 6-13 overall this season with a 2-5 record against Big West opponents, making it seventh place in the conference. This should be a winnable game for UCSB, as it has proven itself to be the superior team previously.
The Matadors' offensive attack is led by senior outside hitter Aeryn Owens and her 4.60 kills per set, good enough for fourth in the Big West in that category. Kristey Markle spearheads Northridge on the defensive side of the ball in large part due to her average of 3.81 digs per set this season. The last time CSUN and UCSB faced off, it was the defensive efforts of Santa Barbara's senior libero Emilia Petrachi and her 15 digs that made the difference in the win. Petrachi leads the Big West in total digs, and if she finds a way to dominate defensively again, it should result in a Gaucho win. A successful weekend for Coach Lantagne Welch's squad would be very encouraging and establish some much needed momentum for a stretch run in conference play.

sports,UCSB Blows Out Matadors to Keep Conference Hopes Alive,21-Oct-18,9:58 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-21/ucsb-blows-out-matadors-to-keep-conference-hopes-alive/,"Giovanny Acosta prepares to pass the ball. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus After a lackluster first half, the UCSB men's soccer team came out on fire in the second half, scoring three goals in seven minutes to cruise to a 3-0 victory over Cal State Northridge. As has been the case for much of conference play, the Gauchos entered Saturday's match desperately needing a win to create some separation in the standings. Both CSUN and Santa Barbara began the night tied in third place on seven points, and with only one point separating third and seventh in the conference, both teams knew the importance of a positive result. Despite this, the Matadors emerged as the much more dangerous side in the first half. Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg opened the match in a 4-2-2-2 formation, opting to keep the same side that had tormented UC Davis earlier in the week. The Matadors were prepared, opting to play with a right winger in order to force junior forward-turned-wing-back Ignacio Tellechea to defend against their explosive attack.  In the 28th minute, CSUN's star forward Daniel Trejo took advantage of the matchup, gathering the ball in midfield and running through the left-hand side of the defense before squaring up a near-post shot, which freshman keeper Ben Roach barely kept out. In the 33rd minute, Matador forward Johnny Rodriguez sprinted past both center backs of the Gauchos but was caught on the break by junior forward Sahid Conteh to keep the score 0-0. Going forward, UCSB seemed just as lost, content to launch long balls to sophomore forward Rodney Michael and hope he could run onto it. With no other forward player showing any touch going forward, the offense seemed like a fish out of water during the half. ""úIt was clear that our plan didn't work in the first half,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úThey had a lot of success in wide areas in the first half, and we just wanted to get into halftime with the score 0-0 so we could make adjustments.""ù Thanks to some last-second defending and a handful of outstanding saves by Roach, they were indeed able to enter the locker room unscathed. From there, Vom Steeg could work his magic ""î the very magic that won the national championship in 2006. ""úIn the second half, I went back to a straight up 4-4-2 and shifted to zonal defending,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úThis allowed us to move Tellechea back up to his natural position of forward and confused the Northridge players.""ù The changes worked exactly as planned. After getting outshot 8-3 in the first half, Santa Barbara came out completely re-energized in the second half, led by Tellechea's presence at the front.  In the 50th minute, Tellechea picked up an errant clearance from the CSUN keeper near the left-side of the box and played a cutback pass to sophomore forward Kaya Fabretti in the middle of the box. With no defender near him, Fabretti easily slotted the shot past the keeper to give Santa Barbara a crucial 1-0 lead. But the Gauchos didn't settle there, scoring twice in a five-minute span for the fifth time this season. In the 54th minute, Conteh used his pace to sprint past the Matador defenders on the right side, before spotting sophomore forward Rodney Michael at the top of the box.  Michael gathered the pass with his right foot, before sending a shot with his left foot low and hard to the bottom right corner to double the lead for the Gauchos. ""úEvery time we get a first goal, we push really hard to get that second,""ù Conteh said. ""úThe second goal gives us some cushion to get on the ball and take control of the game.""ù Even then, Santa Barbara refused to just sit on the ball. Down the right flank once again, junior defender Noah Billingsley played in a perfect cross in the 58th minute that found the head of sophomore defender Hunter Ashworth, whose header struck the top bar and caromed down for the third and final goal of the night. ""úThe service was so good from him that all I had to do was put the ball on frame,""ù Ashworth said. With a secure lead, the Gauchos were able to rest their starters the remainder of the night. In total, UCSB outshot CSUN 10-1 in the second half en-route to its dominant victory. Now, the Gauchos must turn their attention to Cal Poly, who will come to Harder Stadium for the last game of the season. Santa Barbara sits alone in third place in the Big West and are only two points away from second place ""î a spot that would allow a first-round-bye. With their RPI all the way up to 43, another convincing win next Saturday could suddenly propel the Gauchos into the discussion for an at-large bid for the NCAA Tournament.

sports,"After Falling to LBSU, Gauchos End Three-Game Slide with Victory over CSUN",22-Oct-18,5:18 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/after-falling-to-lbsu-gauchos-end-three-game-slide-with-victory-over-csun/,"Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus On Friday night, the UCSB women's volleyball team blew a 2-0 set lead and lost a tight five-set match to Long Beach State. On Saturday night, the Gauchos flipped the script with a comeback victory of their own over Cal State Northridge in five sets. It was an intense weekend of road volleyball for the Santa Barbara side, who snapped a three-game losing streak with the win over the Matadors. The Gauchos are now 12-9 overall and tied for fourth place at 5-5 in the Big West. UCSB had the Beach on their back foot to start things off on Friday night. Star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins was her usual dynamic self with 13 kills in those two sets, providing the closing three points in the Gauchos' 25-20 opening-set win. The attack was humming for UCSB early, particularly in that first set. The Gauchos hit at a .300 clip with an efficient 14 kills on only 30 attacks, before dropping to a .179 in the second set. That decline didn't keep the Gauchos from securing the first two sets, but the Beach turned things around in the third set with a fairly commanding 25-20 victory. Playing with their backs against the wall, Long Beach State jumped out to a big lead early and never let up. The last two sets, on the other hand, were much more contested affairs. UCSB hit .389 as a team in the fourth set, but that wasn't enough to best Long Beach State's .424 clip as the hosts won the last three points to snag a 26-24 win. The fifth set was much lighter on offensive firepower but still packed plenty of drama, with the Beach pulling out another extra point victory 19-17 to secure the match. Ruddins led all attackers with 31 kills and was one dig shy of a double-double. She had help on the attack from Rowan Ennis (14 kills, .294 hitting percentage) and Torre Glasker (13 kills, 14 digs), both of whom have developed into consistent secondary options on the attack for the Gauchos. Olivia Lovenberg, as always, kept the UCSB attack flowing with 58 assists, and just missed out on her own double-double with nine digs. The freshman added two service aces as well for a respectable three-and-a-half total points. Friday's loss pushed the UCSB losing streak to three games, the longest such slide the team has had all year. Another road game on Saturday night presented a tough turnaround for the Gauchos, even if the Matadors, now at 6-15 and 2-7 in the conference, are one of the Big West's weaker teams. Even still, UCSB came close to losing their fourth straight on Saturday. CSUN secured a 25-19 win in the first and then outbattled the Gauchos to pick up the third set, which put themselves on the brink of their third victory in Big West play. The Gauchos came storming right back, however, hitting .270 in the fourth set en route to a 25-19 victory of their own. Just like on Friday night, set five went to extra points, but this time UCSB managed to pull it out with a 20-18 win. Ruddins, Glasker, and Ennis once again paced the Gaucho offense, with Ruddins and Glasker both posting double-doubles as well. Emilia Petrarchi led all players with 22 digs, but it was Nicole Omwanghe and her 7 total blocks that really stood out on the defensive end for the Gauchos. It was a solid UCSB team performance on defense, as the Matadors were able to muster a hitting percentage of just .172. That was enough for the attack to win a very back-and-forth match to snap the slide and keep the Gauchos in a tie for fourth place in the Big West with Long Beach State. UCSB will look to avenge a painful loss a couple of weeks ago to Hawaii when the Gauchos fly halfway across the Pacific Ocean to take on the Rainbow Warriors next Saturday night at 10:00 PT.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus Following the Gaucho's walk-off strike in the 90th minute against Cal State Fullerton earlier this weekend, UCSB's Madeline Gibson netted a late goal in the 83rd minute to propel UCSB over Hawaii with a dramatic 1-0 victory.   With the win, the ""òChos hurdle into the sole third place spot with an 11-6 overall record, 4-2 in conference (12 points). Hawaii will fall into fifth place following the late loss as it drops to 8-6-1 overall, 3-3 in league play (9 points).  ""úThat wasn't just one step, that was one leap forward,""ù expressed Head Coach Paul Stumpf following his team's climactic triumph. ""úThat was a team tied with us in points, so if we end up tied in points, we have the head-to-head for the tie breaker""¶three massive, massive points if you ask me.""ù  UCSB commanded the tempo of Sunday's contest from kick-off as the Gauchos peppered the goal early with six shots on junior keeper Alexis Mata. Mata was put to work quickly after the opening whistle as UCSB maintained possession for the majority of the first half. The Rainbow Wahine struggled to challenge the Gaucho's attack, and didn't fire a shot off until the 28th minute.  Hawaii gained steam as the half went on, forcing junior keeper Hannah DeWeese to leap for consecutive saves in the 28th and 29th minutes and keep the game knotted up at zero a piece. After blocking these two shots on goal, DeWeese only had to make one more save which came in the 52nd minute to pick up her seventh win of the season.  ""úProbably one of the biggest saves of the year,""ù said Stumpf regarding DeWeese's stop in the 29th minute. ""úIt's her job to make one big save a game; tonight she did. Great performance, real pleased.""ù  The Gauchos often struggle to score in the first half of play as the squad has only two first half goals in six Big West Conference matchups. However, once UCSB gets rolling, this team has plenty of weapons to attack with after making some slight halftime tweaks.  UCSB burst out of the gates in the second half, as Shaelan Murison took two chances on goal within the first 10 minutes. Murison had eight shots in this contest following her late-game heroics on Friday that lifted the Gauchos in the 90th minute for a walk-off 2-1 win. In the 83rd minute, the ""òChos finally got the look they had been waiting for as Cate Post lofted a cross into the box for senior midfielder Madeline Gibson who powered home a strike to take the 1-0 lead. ""úThe work rate that that young lady has, I'm just so happy for her,""ù beamed Stumpf on what Gibson's leadership brings to the team. ""úI love the fact that we're in control of our own destiny. We have one of the two [final] games at home, and we're playing at a pretty high level""¶ I just want enough points to get into that tournament for the first time in two years and reward these kids.""ù Coach Stumpf had remarked before Big West play that it has historically taken 12 points and 4 wins to secure a berth into the Big West Tournament. Following the 1-0 win on Sunday, the Gauchos have met that goal.  Two games remain for UCSB (11-6, 4-2, 12 points) as the ""òChos will host their final home game of the season on Thursday evening against CSUN (6-7-1, 2-4, 6 points) before traveling to Cal Poly (2-12-4, 2-4-1, 7 points) on Sunday to culminate the 2018 regular season.

sports,No.5 UCSB Falls Short Against both No.6 Pacific and No.4 Cal in Doubleheader Weekend,22-Oct-18,5:30 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-22/no-5-ucsb-falls-short-against-both-no-6-pacific-and-no-4-cal-in-doubleheader-weekend/,"Boris Jovanovic searches for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus It was a rough weekend for the Gauchos, as Men's Water Polo lost Saturday's conference matchup against No. 6 Pacific as well as Sunday's regular season match versus No.4 Cal. Both matches were on the road this week and, unfortunately, both were dropped by only a single point. Beginning with Saturday's Golden Coast Conference game, the Pacific Tigers opened up first quarter scoring with a pair of goals from utility sophomore Luke Pavillard and junior attacker Luis Araya. In response, UCSB closed out the rest of quarter with a triplet of their own, as senior driver Boris Jovanovic put away two and junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic netted one as well. The second quarter featured more of the same as the Tigers briefly returned the tally in their favor after freshman attacker Eli Lule scored and Araya added on another. Gauchos' junior attacker, Jacob Halle, would then score with 3 minutes left before the half; bringing it all level once more at 4 apiece. The latter half proved to be in UCSB's favor as the Blue and Gold outscored the hosts 4-2. All different scorers in this one as sophomore defender Mason McQuet, sophomore attacker Cole Brosnan, junior driver Tommy Fellner, and Jovanovic again, all notched one in; bringing the Gauchos ahead by only a score of 8-6. UCSB's advantage only grew at the beginning of the fourth and final quarter, as two more from Brosnan extended the Gaucho lead to 10-6. However, a streak of 4 goals by Pacific would ultimately tie things up late as they turned the tables on Santa Barbara. With two minutes left in the game, UCSB responded as a goal by Fellner gave the visiting side the lead once more. Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, it wasn't enough to take back momentum as the on-fire Tigers set up a pair of goals from Pavillard, with the game-deciding score coming in at 39 seconds left on the clock. Thus, granting Pacific the 12-11 home win; which was enough to earn them second (2-0) in GCC standings and knocking UCSB down to third place (1-1). Sunday's match featured even more back and forth as UCSB visited the Cal Bears; the third time these two sides faced each other this season. Cal jumped ahead early with a quick 4-2 start, thanks in part to a brace from junior attacker Jordan Hoover who would go on to earn a game-leading in scoring with 6 to his name. Jovanovic and Gvozdanovic would both earn their second goals of the day as they helped the visiting Gauchos to bring the score back within one, as their team trailed 6-7 by the halfway mark. Jovanovic would also go on to score a team-leading 5 of his own by the end of the match. The third quarter had hopes high as the Gauchos briefly tied it all up at 8-8 as Jovanovic's third paved the way for a potential flip in momentum. Still, the Bears fought back for a 2-goal buffer as the hosts closed out the quarter with a 10-8 lead. Although the Gauchos would ultimately go on to lose in the final quarter by only a score of 12-13, they played with resilience against a nationally higher ranked side who drastically outscored them all year long. UCSB stays at home this week, as the Gauchos continue their Golden Coast Conference campaign versus Long Beach State.

sports,Athlete Spotlight: Redshirt Junior Outside Hitter Lindsey Ruddins,25-Oct-18,5:35 AM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/84517/,"Photo courtesy of Lindsey Ruddins In 2015, after only six matches, Lindsey Ruddins endured injuries that ended her first year; however, the Laguna Niguel native bounced back after medically redshirting for the rest of the season.  Following her recuperation, Ruddins recorded one of the most impressive seasons for a freshman in Gaucho history. Her 2016 campaign saw her collect All-American honors as well as Big West Freshman of the Year. The adversity of season-ending injuries is enough hardship to overcome in the first place, but Ruddins didn't let that stop her from continuing her early success.  In 2017, Ruddins' battle with injuries returned to a lesser extent. Yet she persevered again, rising to the top of NCAA charts in individual accolades. With a 5.84 kills per set average, she led the country and earned All-Big West First Team, All-Pacific South Region First Team, Team MVP and AVCA All-America honorable mention.  This season, Ruddins has been racking up awards while consistently sitting at the top of NCAA DI rankings for attacks per set and kills per set. The redshirt junior somehow stays modest in the midst of such outstanding achievements and stresses that her team remains her focus. Recently, Ruddins earned her fourth Big West Player of the Week award of the season.  Calvin Thrift: You obviously have a high usage rate when you're on the court. With your history of injuries, is there a fatigue aspect that you talk about with your coaches before games? Lindsey Ruddins: My coaches are super understanding and try to manage my shoulder so that I'm not super sore or anything going into a game, but a lot of that is taken care of in the training room, like icing. CT: You snapped a losing streak recently, but when you're in the middle of a rough patch ""î like losing two games to Big West teams ""î do you approach the coming matches any differently? LR: Definitely losing two games in a row sucks, but I think our team is confident, and Hawai""òi and Cal Poly are two great teams. But I think we go into every game prepared and ready to play. CT: This season your sister, Gigi, joined the team. What's that been like playing together? LR: It's a lot of fun. I wasn't sure how it was going to be, but I've really enjoyed it. She's super fun to play with; she's super high energy all the time. CT: If you could play any other sport what would it be and how do you think you'd do? LR: Oh, gosh. Probably soccer, just because I used to play that when I was younger. But I don't think I'd do very well. I was a midfielder but I'm not good at running anymore. CT: How long have you been playing volleyball? LR: I've been playing since I was little with my dad, but I've been playing club volleyball since the eighth grade. CT: How does mental health play a role within your training and game schedule when you're trying to balance your social life, school and also playing a Division I sport? LR: The team has a lot of people we can talk to and meet with. We have a sports psychologist who we can meet with at any time. Also, just having supportive teammates who are always there for you makes it easier to balance everything.

sports,Blue-Green Rivalry Comes to SB,25-Oct-18,5:05 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/blue-green-rivalry-comes-to-sb/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Every time UCSB takes on Cal Poly, the stakes are high. The rivalry match between the two sides has accounted for 15 of the 19 highest-attended soccer matches in NCAA history, and every year it seems that both teams put their best foot forward in this match.
On Saturday, when the Mustangs come to town, the stakes will be even higher for both sides. For Santa Barbara, the team will be looking to avenge their 1-0 loss at Cal Poly earlier in the year. While they have already clinched at least the third seed in the conference tournament, a victory coupled with a Riverside loss to Fullerton would catapult the team into second place ""î securing them a first round bye in the tournament. The Mustangs face a much more perilous situation, needing all three points from Saturday's match to even have a chance of making the Big West tournament. If they can pick up the away win at Harder Stadium, Cal Poly would still need losses by both Sacramento State and UC Davis to leapfrog into sixth place. As of late, Cal Poly has dominated this rivalry game. Since Steve Sampson was appointed head coach of Cal Poly in 2015, the team has only lost one matchup to the Gauchos, with their last two trips to Harder Stadium both resulting in scoreless draws. When the two teams matched up earlier this year for a non-conference game, UCSB played one of their worst games of the season. Offensively, the Gauchos were one-dimensional, launching long balls toward the direction of sophomore forward Rodney Michael and hoping he could run onto one in space. While the team played well defensively, a wonder-goal by Mustang junior midfielder Diego Alonso ultimately proved to be the deciding goal. Since then, both teams have gone in opposite directions. Cal Poly has only won one match in the six since, with their latest loss a heartbreaking defeat to No. 1 UC Irvine. Due to their recent dip in form, the Mustangs have fallen to a 5-8-2 record. After a rough midseason stretch ""î underscored by the loss in San Luis Obispo ""î Santa Barbara is unbeaten in their past three matches, entering Saturday with a 9-6-1 record. In addition, the Gauchos remain undefeated at Harder Stadium, coming in with a perfect 8-0 record. Cal Poly primarily runs their offense through senior forward Sean Goode, who has collected seven goals so far this season. However, the Mustangs have struggled to score all season, with only 17 goals in 15 games. Against a stellar Gaucho backline that has allowed less than one goal per game this year, look for Cal Poly to once again struggle to find much room to operate. Similarly to the Gauchos, Cal Poly is a much stronger team on the other half of the pitch, only conceding 19 goals in 15 games. In the first matchup between these teams, senior keeper Simon Boehme played an outstanding game, making multiple key saves to keep the Gauchos off the board. If Santa Barbara hopes to reverse their fate on Saturday, they will need an on-and-off attack to be firing on all cylinders. The Gauchos will look to build on their second-half success against CSUN where the 'Chos scored three goals in a ten minute span. Much of that offense was predicted around junior forward Ignacio Tellechea, who was moved to striker to start the second half. While he still remains goalless this season, his movement up front opened up space for his fellow attackers. As has remained the status quo all year, the main goal threat for Santa Barbara is Michael, who has notched seven goals and three assists this season. His pace and skill moves make him a perpetual threat to find the back of a net, which the Gauchos will look to take advantage of on Saturday. With everything on the line for both sides, expect a chippy and heated affair in this year's Blue-Green rivalry match. Kickoff at Harder Stadium will take place at 5 p.m. on Saturday.

sports,"Gauchos Host Matadors, Travel to Cal Poly for Final Games of 2018",25-Oct-18,5:30 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/gauchos-host-matadors-travel-to-cal-poly-for-final-games-of-2018/,"Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus As the Gauchos' rollercoaster season wraps up this weekend, UCSB looks to gain some crucial points with results in its final two games. Cal State Northridge visits Harder Stadium on Thursday evening for the Gauchos' final home game of the season, and Santa Barbara will travel up to San Luis Obispo to close out the season with the annual Blue-Green Rivalry. Santa Barbara (11-6, 4-2, 12 points) claims the sole third spot in the Big West following consecutive wins last weekend against Cal State Fullerton and Hawai""òi. Alternatively, the Matadors (6-7-1, 2-4, 6 points) have had their woes this year as the squad sits in the eighth spot in conference play just above Fullerton who is winless in Big West matchups. CSUN enters Thursday's matchup following losses in its last two matches against UC Irvine and UC Davis by respective scores of 3-0 and 1-0. Northridge burst out of the gate with a strong start to the season during road contests, but this is a different Matador team in conference play. They've struggled immensely on the road during Big West matchups as CSUN remains winless in conference away games. The Matadors are 4-2-1 in away games this year, but each of those wins came during the former half of the season. Since Big West play began last month, Northridge has racked up a mere two wins, both of which came at home. Northridge has 14 goals this season, tied with Cal Poly for the lowest in the Big West this season. If their scoring troubles weren't problematic enough during the first half of the season, they've declined even more in conference play. Northridge averages .67 goals per game, No. 8 in the Big West. The hosting Gauchos, on the other hand, boast a hearty 1.65 goals per match to CSUN's 1.00 overall goals per match. Moreover, UCSB allows less than a goal a game at .92 goals allowed per match while the Matadors let by 1.3 goals per game which is the seventh highest mark in conference. As for the Cal Poly Mustangs, they've allowed a bulky 2.06 goals per game while scoring only .78 goals in each match. The Mustangs (2-12-4, 2-4-1, 7 points) have picked up their sole two wins of the season during Big West play as they reside in the seventh spot of the standings. Poly recorded wins against CSUN in late September and winless Cal State Fullerton last weekend. The Mustangs boast the top goal saver in the Big West conference with 107 saves, significantly more than the No. 2 keeper who has 80 stops. However, that could be accredited to the astronomical amount of shots on goal she faces. Junior keeper Sophia Brown has faced roughly 147 shots on goal this year while no other goal keeper in the Big West has had to deal with even 100 shots on goal. Brown's save percentage is a dainty .728, the second lowest in the conference. The Matadors and the Mustangs will prepare to face junior keeper Hanna DeWeese, last week's Big West Conference Defensive Player of the Week. DeWeese has been a staple for the Gauchos since her second-half heroics against UC Berkeley earlier this season. After coming off the bench in the second half, DeWeese's shut out against then-No. 24 Cal earned her the starting gig and she's been lights out ever since. As for the attack, senior captain Shaelan Murison has 10 goals this season for the second most in the Big West with five game winners on the year. Her counterpart Mallory Hromatko is No. 1 in assists this year with six, however she's slowed down come conference play as most of the assists came early in the season. Shaelan Murison and the Gauchos (11-6, 4-2) host Cal State Northridge (6-7-1, 2-4) on Thursday evening at 7 p.m. before culminating the 2018 season on Sunday afternoon in San Luis Obispo against the Cal Poly Mustangs (2-12-4, 2-4-1) at 2 p.m..

sports,Gauchos Return Home for GCC Match Against LBSU,25-Oct-18,5:15 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/gauchos-return-home-for-gcc-match-against-lbsu/,"Boris Jovanovic searches for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus No. 5 UCSB men's water polo team, currently 16-8 overall and 1-1 in conference play, will face No. 9 Long Beach State this Friday in the Gauchos' second to last home game of the season. Coming off a down-to-the-wire loss to No. 4 UC Berkeley by a score of 13-12, Santa Barbara will look to break its two-game losing streak and rebound against a 49er squad who has struggled mightily this season with a 7-10 record.  Both teams are very familiar with each other, having faced each other twice on the year, with the ""òChos getting the victory both times thus far. Last week, Long Beach State lost a more competitive match than the final score (6-13) would indicate to the No. 3 USC Trojans.  Despite the loss to USC, Long Beach is supported by redshirt junior attacker Austin Stewart leads the 49ers with 34 goals and six assists this season.  Losers of nine of their last 10 games, Long Beach State is desperate to break out of their recent struggles. During this stretch, they have been unable to find any sort of rhythm on offense, with an average of a mere eight goals per game. The 49ers will likely look towards Stewart to solidify an offensive attack heading into their Santa Barbara matchup.  One major key to success for UCSB will be to keep the 49ers under 10 goals for the entire match, as the Gauchos have a record of 11-1 when this occurs. Sophomore goalkeeper Tiago Bonchristiano continues to gain more confidence in front of the net with the more experience he gets and has only allowed an average of 10 goals per game this month.  Moreover, it will be crucial for senior driver Boris Jovanovic to constantly put pressure on the 49er defense and remain involved offensively as he leads the team in goals. Coming off a huge five-goal game against Berkeley's line of defense, Jovanovic should have no issue getting things started for the Gauchos again this week. In an up-and-down month for Santa Barbara, one bright spot has been the play of its offense as the Gauchos have continued to find ways to find the back of the net, primarily due to the unselfish nature of the team. Four players currently have more than 10 assists, which makes the ""òChos extremely hard to defend. This is especially true when teams are forced to put so much energy into containing Jovanovic up front.  As just three games remain on the schedule, UCSB will look to end the year on a high note and reach 19 wins on the season, which would be a major improvement from last year where the team finished the season with a sub-.500, 11-12 record.  With the potential of an eight-game improvement, it is clear that the Gauchos have made major strides this season, in spite of losing a handful of close games to the nation's top programs. Additionally, with promising youth on the roster, UCSB and head coach Wolf Wigo will have plenty to work with going forward, with or without GCC success this season.†The Gauchos will play Long Beach State at 3 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 26, and will look to get their third win at home.

sports,Head Coach Vom Steeg Reflects on Blue-Green Rivalry,25-Oct-18,4:03 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/head-coach-vom-steeg-reflects-on-blue-green-rivalry/,"File Photo / Daily Nexus In just one year, the number of attendees to the Mustang-Gaucho showdown skyrocketed from 1,123 to 8,102. The difference? A little rumor that the defending national champs were headed north. Undefeated in the twelve-part series against the Mustangs and newly backed by their first NCAA title in history, the 2007 No.10 UCSB men's soccer team strode confidently into the familiar stadium of San Luis Obispo. There, an unprecedented audience of 7,143 green- and gold-clad fans waited not-so patiently to watch their beloved squad take down the reigning champions. This game was the first time Cal Poly had beaten UCSB since 2000. The Gauchos' fanbase responded eagerly upon their team's return home that year, rallying a record-breaking 8,102 people into a packed Harder Stadium for the rematch between the two squads. At the time, only few recognized the historic shift in the oppositional dynamic of Cal Poly-Santa Barbara soccer. One of them was the 2006 NCAA Division I National Coach of the Year""îa.k.a., UCSB's very own head coach, Tim Vom Steeg. Vom Steeg's familiarity with Cal Poly dates back to 1985 when he began playing collegiate soccer for UCSB. Now into his 20th year at the helm of the soccer program, the seasoned coach is able to look back at 30+ years of match-ups and observe the evolution of the rivalrous nature between the programs. ""úWe've always had kind of a natural rivalry against them because of the location and distance. Even back when I played, it was always a game that we used to always want to play,""ù Vom Steeg reflects. Cal Poly's program, however, never quite matched the level of Santa Barbara's. Before officially meeting UCSB in Big West Conference play in 1996, it made its way through Division II and did not enter Division I until 1994. Preoccupied with their in-conference battle with Cal State Northridge for top-seed, the Gauchos paid little attention to the Mustangs' entering. Vom Steeg recalls, ""úWhen they joined Big West""¶we didn't think much about Cal Poly.""ù He acknowledges that Santa Barbara's ""úgeneral success""ù over them fed into the maturing feud. Upon the series of events in 2007 as aforementioned, however, the rivalry escalated to a level beyond prediction. Over the years, it has materialized into packed stadiums and rowdy crowds, distasteful screaming of ironic slogans like ""úCuck Fal Poly""ù, and an ungodly amount of tortillas thrown-to-waste. Vom Steeg carefully makes an important distinction between how the UCSB-Cal Poly rivalry takes form at Alex. G. Spanos Stadium versus that at Harder Stadium. ""úThe fans up at Cal Poly""¶are there mainly to""¶have a big party. They turn it""¶a little bit more into just an event that you get a bunch of people together and scream and yell,""ù he states matter-of-factly. For a number of reasons, traveling to Cal Poly is hardly an enjoyable experience for the team. The close quartered football-turned-soccer field subjects them to audible criticisms from thousands of hovering fans. Up in SLO, Vom Steeg continues, ""úThe referees are usually more emotional. The last two years we've had water bottles thrown at us. If you happen to lose the game, [the fans] jump over the side""¶It's really hard to play naturally [and]""¶easy to make it hard to play soccer.""ù Silencing the infamous crowd remains one of his most memorable moments at Spanos Stadium. In 2009, senior Chris Pontius scored seconds into double overtime to win the game for the Gauchos. ""úThe whole place was just absolutely quiet. Chris ran around the whole stadium, we were chasing him as he was celebrating, and the whole place was dead quiet,""ù he gladly recounted. In the coach's eyes, Harder Stadium harbors a much more authentic environment for the team. The professional-like layout opens up the field while separating the players from the overwhelming crowds. He mostly appreciates the fans'""îcomprised of both students and locals""îknowledge of the actual game, noting, ""úIt feels like a soccer game. The cheering is about good plays on the field,""ù as compared to screaming about the opponent's mistakes. This aspect, among others, was one of the driving factors in Vom Steeg's decision in 1999 to take control of a struggling program that had, in the season prior to his arrival, merely two wins and 17 losses to its name. Ironically, Vom Steeg's first time coaching UCSB was against Cal Poly. 20 years later, the accomplished coach has deep-rooted ties to Santa Barbara and holds some of the biggest accolades in collegiate soccer. He is a two-time NCSAA National Coach of the Year and a five-time Big West Coach of the Year. Under the reigns of Vom Steeg, UCSB made it into the Sweet 16 of NCAA four times and even hosted and won an NCAA Championship along the way. Talking about the essential creation of and dedication to the soccer program, Vom Steeg notes, ""úThe big key for me has been the amount of work, the energy we've put in, the relationships we developed. The idea of starting over again has kept me from looking [at other options]. I'd rather keep enjoying what we've built here, and I still think there's room for us to get better.""ù More specifically, this hard work has contributed to the establishment of Santa Barbara's winning record over Cal Poly; one that, as of recently however, has begun to deteriorate. Now awaiting the 41st matchup, Vom Steeg hopes to break the sense of complacency that has overwhelmed the Gauchos' gameplay in the past years. Upon the hiring of former US National coach Steve Sampson, Cal Poly has strategically and effectively dulled the matchups against their blue and gold rival. The result? Four straight draws at Harder Stadium since 2014, the latest two finalizing with scores of 0-0. To rationalize SLO's gameplay, Vom Steeg points out, ""úWhen you get caught in a situation where maybe you're not sure your talent matches up, you do things on the field to make it really hard to play.""ù He continues, ""úIt's up to us this year to, more than ever, try to figure out how we can make it into a more exciting soccer game than what it's been.""ù Coach Tim Vom Steeg hopes to disrupt this pattern of stagnancy with a sweet victory over the Mustangs. After all, the win could be the 258th of his career, 24th against their program, and the key to unleashing the prideful insanity that the community has so eagerly awaited to display.

sports,Interview With the Enemy: Cal Poly Junior Midfielder Diego Alonso,25-Oct-18,5:20 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-25/interview-with-the-enemy-cal-poly-junior-midfielder-diego-alonso/,"Photo courtesy of Diego Alonso In the three years that Diego Alonso has played for the Cal Poly men's soccer team. he's risen from bench player to captain. While he didn't get much playing time his freshman year, he was in the top five in assists in the Big West last year, and has become one of the best playmakers on the team. Originally from Berkeley, Calif., Alonso progressed through the San Jose Earthquakes club system before eventually declaring for the Cal Poly Mustangs. So far this season he is third on the team in overall points and has emerged as a stabilizing presence on an oftentimes erratic squad. In this year's first iteration of the Blue-Green rivalry, Alonso was able to break a 0-0 deadlock 63 minutes in with a strike from 25 yards away that found the back of the net. The Daily Nexus was able to sit down with Alonso and get his thoughts on the biggest college soccer rivalry in the country, and what it's like approaching it from a Mustang point of view. Omar Hernandez: So you were able to break the tie and score what would turn out to be the game-winning goal in the last matchup between Cal Poly and UCSB. How did it feel to mark your own place in this historic rivalry? Diego Alonso: It was an honor, to be honest. We always look forward to the hype surrounding this rivalry and this game, and to score the winning goal was a dream come true. Just having that sold-out crowd cheering behind me ""î I couldn't have asked for a better opportunity. OH: An interesting pattern these last few years has been the domination by the home side of this matchup. What do you think has led to this discrepancy? DA: Obviously the home crowd is a big advantage for us. In Spanos the stands are a lot closer, so we can really feel that energy. We definitely get motivated by all the chants you guys yell at us at Harder (Laughter), but the feeling of being in front of the home crowd is a different level. OH: You sure the tortillas don't make a difference? DA: Well we don't do much of that over at our place (Laughter). But yeah, whenever we get fouled or a throw-in by your guys' sideline, we definitely know those tortillas are coming. OH: Getting on a more personal note, what does this rivalry mean to you? DA: I actually didn't know about it when I first committed to Cal Poly. But just seeing it from the bench my freshman year really showed me why people consider it one of the biggest rivalries in the country. These games have a professional atmosphere, and even though they're regular-season games, they feel like a finals or postseason matchup. We always say that the Blue-Green rivalry has to stay green, so playing in it you feel like you're not just playing for yourself or your teammates but for the pride of the whole school. OH: I don't want to get you in trouble with Coach Sampson, but what is some of the strategy you guys have talked over heading into Saturday? Both you guys and the Gauchos seem to play a similar style of soccer. DA: We try to do what the matchups command. So""¶ [with those] last few games against CSUN and Sac State, our philosophy was keeping the ball on the ground and playing with our brains. When we play UCSB, we know that you guys have that height at the center-back. We know that games like those can get real chippy and physical, so going into SB, we didn't talk too much strategy. We just know we have to win every ball in the air, win those 50-50 balls and just win the physical battle. OH: Alright, you gotta settle one thing for me: Whose campus is better? DA: I've actually never been to UCSB's campus so I can't really speak to that (Laughter). OH: Alright, whose city? Santa Barbara or SLO? Be honest with me; there's a right answer and a wrong one. DA: Alright, I'll give it to Santa Barbara on this one. A version of this story appeared on P. 8 of the Oct. 25 print version of the Daily Nexus.

Nicole Wallace/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's volleyball team almost took Hawai""òi the last time they played. It was back on Oct. 5, when the Gauchos pushed the Rainbow Warriors to five sets for the first time since 2014 but dropped that final set and the match. On Saturday, UCSB will try to improve upon that result and come out with their first win over Hawai""òi since 2013. While that first match was in the Thunderdome, this one will be in Honolulu, as the Gauchos wrap up their four-game road trip. That loss to the Rainbow Warriors was the first in a three-game losing streak, which UCSB snapped last Saturday at CSUN with a 3-2 win. Now sitting at 13-9 overall and 5-5 in the Big West, the Gauchos have some work to do to climb the standings and catch up to at least UC Irvine, at 6-2. UCSB also has an opportunity to play the spoiler for Hawai""òi's conference title hopes. A loss to Cal Poly is the Rainbow Warrior's only conference blemish, at 13-6 and 9-1, and another loss would all but doom Hawai""òi's chances from achieving at least a share of the Big West title. The Rainbow Warriors have relied on a balanced attack all season, with five players averaging over two kills per set. That balanced attack burned the Gauchos at the beginning of October, when four different Rainbow Warriors posted double-digit kills in the five-set victory. Senior outside hitter McKenna Granato is the leading Hawai""òi attacker with 3.29 kills per set, good for sixth in the Big West. The Gauchos will have to do a better job limiting Granato and the four other attacking Rainbow Warriors ""ì Norene Iosia, Casey Castillo, Natasha Burns and Sarah Liva ""ì in order to return to the mainland victorious. The UCSB attack isn't quite as balanced as the system boasted by Hawai""òi, but it is more multipolar than it's been in past years. Torre Glasker and Rowan Ennis both have more than two kills per set and come on particularly strong in conference play as able, complementary players to Lindsey Ruddins and her 5.43 kills per set. Those three hitters will have to be a whole lot more effective this time than they were back on Oct. 5. Ruddins had her worst game of the season, hitting just .043 and committing 13 errors, while Glasker hit -.088. Even with those struggles, the Gauchos were still able to push the Rainbow Warriors to five sets. The margin for error will be much lower in Honolulu than it was at home, but it's unlikely UCSB will hit too far below their average hitting percentage of .235. It's unlikely, however, that the Gauchos will get as good of a chance at the Rainbow Warriors as they did last time. In that first matchup, Hawai""òi had its worst attacking game of the season, hitting just .138 percent with 31 errors. The Rainbow Warriors seem to have patched things up since that matchup, as their hitting percentage has only increased since then. They steamrolled Cal State Fullerton in three sets on Saturday night with a hitting percentage of .333 and seem primed to prove that earlier match was an aberration. The Gauchos, then, will have to do the same on Saturday if they're to have any hope at pulling off the upset. It's not all on the attack either; Hawai""òi's opponents have averaged 2.30 blocks per set, which would be good for second in the Big West, so UCSB will also have to capitalize defensively. The Oct. 5 loss wasn't pretty, but it proved that the Gauchos can hang with Hawai""òi. On Saturday, UCSB will have a chance to show that it can do more than just hang. UCSB takes on Hawai""òi on Saturday night at 10:00 p.m. in Honolulu. A version of this story appeared on P.9 of the Oct. 25 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Lynsee Voss Strikes With Two Late-Goals to Secure the Win,28-Oct-18,5:05 AM,['Sports Editor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-28/lynsee-voss-strikes-with-two-late-goals-to-secure-the-win/,"Amaya Zabalza gets the ball around an opposing player. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team triumphed in a dramatic late win on Thursday evening, as junior midfielder Lynsee Voss rifled in two goals in the 63rd and 71st minutes to vault Santa Barbara over Cal State Northridge with a 2-1 victory. ""úIt's a massive relief to know that we're in the Big West Tournament,""ù gleamed Coach Paul Stumpf while letting out a sigh of relief. ""úIf we win on Sunday, we win the title outright; you can hear them in the locker room, they're obviously celebrating, but it's not done yet. They'll recover their bodies, get their minds right, and hopefully put on another big performance on Sunday.""ù The Gauchos (12-6, 5-2 Big West) leapt into a first-place tie with UC Irvine as each team has garnered a hearty 15 points this season. The Matadors (6-8-1, 2-5 Big West) remained in the eighth spot following the tough loss to a streaking Santa Barbara squad. Both teams clamped down on the defensive end in the first half of play as there were only a combined three shots fired off before the break. Freshman keeper Amanda Delgado leapt to make two crucial saves in the 17th and 19th minutes which kept score knotted up at zero a piece. In the 51st minute, the Matadors' fed a streaking Alexis White who entered the box and took a chance at goal as she fired toward the near post across her body. Gaucho junior Hannah DeWeese laid out to make a diving save, but White finessed a quick touch to CSUN forward Bethany Fitzsimmons who weaseled past a shot to take a 1-0 lead. White had another chance at goal a mere 3 minutes later, but DeWeese once again made a critical stop to keep the game tight. The Gauchos maintained control over the next 10 minutes and managed to get solid shots at goal but couldn't convert. In minute 63, freshman forward Jessica Wright sent a cross into the box that was deflected by a CSUN defender and directed to Lynsee Voss. Voss powered a screamer past a diving Delgado as UCSB tied up the match at 1-1. ""úTechnically speaking on a surface like this, that's difficult,""ù emphasized Stumpf in his twentieth season. ""úIt was a half-volley which is very difficult to keep low; a surface like this, it speeds up and it's slick. She tucked it nicely away in the corner to even it up so that we could get after them for the next one.""ù Just minutes later, Big West assist leader senior Mallory Hromatko delivered a switch to Voss who found space and crept a go-ahead goal past the misplaced Delgado to take a 2-1 lead in the 71st minute. This marked the midfielder's third goal of the season and second game winner this year. Late game heroics have been a common occurrence for the Gauchos this season as 20 out of 30 (67%) total goals this year have come in the second half of games. In each of the Gaucho's most recent three wins, the team has come alive in the second half to score a game-winning goal in the 70th minute or later. UCSB has a chance to clinch the first-place spot on Sunday evening with a victory over seventh place Cal Poly (2-12-4, 2-4-1 Big West). Irvine played its final game of the season on Thursday and is in danger of falling into the third spot with wins from Santa Barbara and Long Beach State over the weekend. The Gauchos play their season finale on the road Sunday against the Cal Poly Mustangs for another chapter of the Blue-Green Rivalry.

sports,Men's Soccer Seeks First-Round Win in Big West Tournament,29-Oct-18,7:50 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-29/mens-soccer-seeks-first-round-win-in-big-west-tournament/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Unbeaten in their last four matches, the UCSB men's soccer team will need to defeat Cal State Fullerton in the first round of the Big West tournament if they hope to prolong their season. After a thrilling 2-0 defeat over rival Cal Poly, Santa Barbara finished the regular season with a 10-6-1 record, including an unblemished 9-0 record at Harder Stadium. While the Gauchos tied for second in the conference with 13 points, their conference loss earlier in the season to UC Riverside means that they must play an extra game in order to make the tournament semifinals. At this point, it seems like UCSB will need to win the conference tournament in order to make the NCAA tournament. Despite their recent hot streak, midseason losses against the likes of Cal Poly and Sacramento State mean that Santa Barbara's RPI is merely 59 ""î not good enough for an at-large bid to the tournament. The first step toward getting that automatic bid will be beating Fullerton at Harder Stadium on Wednesday. Despite being the overwhelming preseason favorite to win the Big West, the Matadors finished sixth in the conference with merely eight points. When these two sides met earlier this season, UCSB defeated Fullerton 1-0 in overtime after a rather underwhelming regulation performance from both sides. While they haven't lived up to their preseason expectations, the Matadors still have one of the most talented teams in the conference. Senior midfielder Ross McPhie is a constant threat when on the ball, having chipped in five assists to lead the team. Most of those assists have gone to senior forward Samuel Goni, who leads the team with six goals on the year. When the Matadors came to Harder Stadium last time, their most impressive player was junior keeper Paul Andre-Guerin, who seemingly snatched every single cross the Gauchos put in the box. In that match, Andre-Guerin recorded four saves, only conceding a goal in overtime. That has been the trend all season for Fullerton, who have merely conceded 20 goals in 19 games. They play elite defense, but go through serious dry spells on the offensive end. As of late, the Gauchos have seemed to find their offense, with five goals in their last two games. Perhaps most impressively, only one of those five goals has come from standout sophomore Rodney Michael. In the Cal Poly match, it was junior transfer Thibault Candia who kickstarted the offense, notching two assists en route to Big West Offensive Player of the Week honors. Both assists found the freshman running past the defense and playing a pass in the box to one of his teammates, with the first going to Kaya Fabbretti and the second to Sahid Conteh. Something worth monitoring this week will be the fitness of sophomore midfielder Carson Vom Steeg, who left the Cal Poly match early after injuring his leg. Vom Steeg has dealt with multiple injuries this season but has been a calming presence in the midfield when healthy. The Gauchos continue to dominate opponents with their defense; in their last four home games, UCSB has kept a clean sheet. The duo of juniors Hunter Ashworth and Faouzi Taieb at the back continue to impose their will on opposing attackers. So far this season, the Gauchos have still not given up a goal on a set piece ""î a rather remarkable statistic. Last season, Santa Barbara's season ended at home when they were upset by UC Riverside in the first game of the conference tournament. They will hope that history doesn't repeat itself on Wednesday when they take on the Matadors, with the winner traveling down to Riverside to take on those very Highlanders on Saturday. UCSB will take on Cal State Fullerton in a loser-go-home match on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.

sports,The Blue-Green Rivalry Stays Blue as UCSB Takes Down Cal Poly 2-0,29-Oct-18,7:05 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-29/the-blue-green-rivalry-stays-blue-as-ucsb-takes-down-cal-poly-2-0/,"Nexus File Photo Under a blanket of fog, blue smoke, and tortillas, the UCSB men's soccer team virtually stunned the Cal Poly Mustangs on Saturday. Their 2-0 victory over the Mustangs signified a momentous breakthrough in the Gauchos' previously underwhelming performance against the rivals, marking their first at-home win since 2014 in the blue-green rivalry game. Remarkably, UCSB's record at Harder Stadium remains spotless after nine matches. The Gauchos, in addition, successfully boosted themselves from sixth to second seed to conclude Big West regular play, finishing with an in-conference record of 4-2-1 (10-6-1 overall). Cal Poly essentially had nothing to lose but pride in this particular matchup, as their Big West performance has been lackluster; their regular conference record capped out at one win, five losses, and a draw. Forwards Sahid Conteh and Kaya Fabretti, who have not seen the scoreboard often this season, each executed routine goals delivered beautifully by Thibault Candia to shut down the Mustangs and secure the monumental win. Haunted by two years of scoreless home games against the Mustangs, the first 45 minutes forecasted an outcome all too familiar to the Gauchos. Though Santa Barbara seemed to dominate possession-wise, Cal Poly successfully inhibited any balls from crossing over the goal line. The Gauchos demonstrated a clear cohesion amongst their back, mid, and front lines. Sophomore Hunter Ashworth controlled a majority of the balls in the back, consistently connecting with junior Thibault Candia who then dolled out pass after pass to his fellow forwards up front. However, the UCSB squad often found themselves unable to execute during pivotal scoring opportunities. Junior Noah Billingsley managed a few promising breakaways that ultimately fell short when the ball failed to find his teammates in the middle of the field. Despite this, the forward maintained a looming presence over the Mustangs for most of the game. Coming off of his first goal from last game against CSUN, Billingsley looked aggressive and eager to do so once again, delivering dangerous passes into scoring territory. The Gauchos' offensive persistence brought SLO's goalie Simon Boehme into the spotlight. The senior added two incredible saves to his previous 61 in the first half. Most notably, Boehme sprawled out to rob UCSB senior Axel Mendez of a powerful boot fired into the top left corner in the 28th minute. As expected, Diego Alonso commanded the Mustang's offense. Responsible for the game-winning shot that sent UCSB home with a distasteful loss earlier in the season, the junior forward continued to outrun the Gaucho midfield and threatened his opponents up top on several occasions. No first half could have foreshadowed the utter dominance the Gauchos displayed over the mustangs in the second. UCSB put immediate pressure on the faltering SLO defense, launching a total of twelve shots toward their green and gold competitors in the last 45 minutes of the rivalry game. It took just five minutes for Sahid Conte to fire a low, powerful goal into the lower left corner of the net. Conteh's success seems long-overdue as the junior has been a threatening presence recently in UCSB's lineup, tallying three assists so far; this was his first goal of the season. Santa Barbara didn't stop here. Ten minutes and another two shots later Kaya Fabretti, who has not seen nearly as much game time as UCSB's other forwards, found himself in perfect position in the box to receive the ball from Candia and score. The common denominator between the two goals? Thibault Candia. The Frenchman's assists set up effortless touches for both Conteh and Fabretti while demonstrated his acute abilities to split defenders and actively find open players. Cal Poly's performance slowly deteriorated over the rest of the match. Their offense tallied a few more shots, but ultimately they lacked the energy and aggression that was fueling their opponents. Most importantly, the Gauchos have both secured the second place spot in Big West regular play and ensured at least another home game coming into the Big West Tournament. They're set to face off against the Cal State Fullerton Titans at Harder Stadium on Halloween night at 7:30 p.m..

sports,UCSB Women's Volleyball Emerges Victorious in Hawaii for First Time Since 2013,29-Oct-18,6:44 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-10-29/ucsb-womens-volleyball-emerges-victorious-in-hawaii-for-first-time-since-2013/,"Nexus File Photo † After a gritty home win last week, the UCSB women's volleyball team rode its momentum into Honolulu and pulled off an upset win in the team's biggest game of the season against the conference-leading Hawaii Rainbow Wahine. The road victory for the Gauchos is their first win over Hawaii since 2013.  The last time the two teams met in the Thunderdome on Oct. 5th Hawaii barely escaped with a win in 5 sets against a scrappy UCSB squad, however; in Saturday's game the Gauchos showed up and went blow-for-blow with the Rainbow Wahine as they overpowered them the whole way, leading to a 3-0 match sweep. This win moves Santa Barbara into a tie for fourth place in the Big West alongside UC Davis with just five games left in the season. It also greatly damages the Gauchos' conference title hopes for Hawaii as they now fall a game back of Cal Poly in the loss column in the standings.  The Big West leader in kills, Lindsey Ruddins, had a relatively quiet game by her standards with 11 kills along with 9 digs and just a .128 kill percentage. She was complemented by her sister, freshman Gigi Ruddins, who tallied 10 kills on a .261 kill percentage to aid in the offensive attack for the Gauchos. Key contributions also came from senior Emilia Petrachi who finished with a game-high 16 digs and freshman Olivia Lovenberg who also lead both teams with 28 assists. The Gauchos were able to bottle up Hawaii's balanced offensive attack for the most part, as no opposing player had more than 10 kills on the match. The Rainbow Wahine were led by junior Mckenna Ross, who totaled 9 kills and 7 digs on the day. However, Hawaii's usual offensive leader Mckenna Granato was kept quiet in this one as she finished with only 8 kills on a .057 kill percentage.  This match began with an eventful first set as both offenses were getting whatever they wanted and the lead changed hands multiple times. The Gauchos were holding on to an 18-17 lead late in the set before Hawaii went on a mini-run to retake the lead at 24-20 and it looked like the Rainbow Wahine were going to put the Gauchos away. UCSB responded and tied the match at 24 before ultimately completing the comeback to take a first-set victory by a score of 28-26. The momentum garnered from their comeback win in the first set carried over into the second as the Gauchos stayed competitive in another tightly contested set. With the second set tied at 18, Santa Barbara decided to make another late run and seal it on a kill by Rowan Ennis to take the 2-0 lead in the match.  By the third and final set, the Gauchos had all but sucked the life out of the Rainbow Wahine, getting out to an early lead and never looking back as they took the third set by a score of 25-21 to complete the sweep.  This is a huge confidence-boosting win for the Gauchos as they head down the final stretch of Big West play and battle for a spot near the top of the standings. With five remaining conference game and three of those being played in at home, this presents a great opportunity for UCSB to finish the season strong.  The Gauchos will take on first-place Cal Poly in their next match with what is sure to be their biggest test of the season thus far. The Blue-Green Rivalry against Cal Poly will be played on Friday, Oct. 7th at 7:00 pm in the Thunderdome as the Gauchos seek to avenge their Oct. 12th loss to the Mustangs. Comments are closed.

The Gauchos (12-6-1 overall, 5-2-1 Big West, 16 points) leapt over Irvine with results in both of their final two matches to vault into second place as Big West regular season play came to a close on Sunday evening. Although UCSB finished with a better record, the No. 3 Anteaters (8-6-4, 4-1-3, 15 points) will draw home field advantage as the entire 2018 Big West Tournament is scheduled to take place at Anteater Stadium in Irvine, Calif. UCSB heads into the match following a draw against Cal Poly that gave them the edge over Irvine in the standings. The Gauchos had a chance to secure first place in the conference with a win against the Mustangs but couldn't hold onto their lead as Poly pulled even at 1-1 to shock the ""òChos and hand them their first draw of the year in the final match of the regular season. Looking forward to their match with Irvine, the Gauchos will rely on Head Coach Paul Stumpf's high-powered offense that leads the Big West with 31 goals scored this season. Quarterbacked by junior winger Shaelan Murison who leads the ""òChos with 10 goals on the season, good for second in the Big West. Late game heroics have been a common occurrence for the Gauchos this season as 21 out of 31 (68%) total goals this year have come in the second half of games. In each of the Gaucho's most recent three wins, the team has come alive in the second half to score a game-winning goal in the 70th minute or later. The Gauchos ferocious crunch-time attack faces stout competition this week as Irvine allows a mere .65 goals per game, good for the least amount of goals against per game in Big West matches. Junior keeper Maddie Newsom will hold it down for the Anteaters as she boasts the second-best shots saved percentage with a .846 save ratio. Newsom's mark is only second to Gaucho junior keeper Hannah DeWeese who has the top save percentage in the Big West with an 85% save rate. ""úWith the help of this team and how well we're doing in general, I haven't had to make too many big saves,""ù gleamed DeWeese. ""úThe other goalies, Nat [Hill] and Mackenzie [Hatanaka], they've helped to build my confidence; they've helped me play how I'm playing""¶ We just need to keep playing our game and stay focused.""ù The veteran leadership for the Gauchos this year has been a huge asset in their success as the six returning seniors played a significant role in earning the No. 2 seed in Coach Stumpf's 20th season with the ""òChos. ""úThose six kids are going to be difficult to replace; not just for soccer, but the character, the leadership, and the competitiveness.""ù said Stumpf about the squad's senior leadership. ""úPeople on the outside do not know just how much work these young ladies put in""¶ The seniors, I hope they know deep down just how much they mean to me. They're just a fantastic group of young ladies.""ù The seniors that Stumpf was referring to include Jessica Clegg, Ryan Kokoska, Madeline Gibson, Mallory Hromatko, Sydney Magnin and Jessica Parque. Heading into their final set of games with UCSB, the weathered and experienced group of leaders look to reach the Big West Conference Finals for the first time since 2009.

sports,Gauchos Head to Irvine for Final Road Game,1-Nov-18,5:10 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/gauchos-head-to-irvine-for-final-road-game/,"Daily Nexus File Photo The Gauchos are looking to start off the month of November in proper form as the men's water polo team will face UC Irvine for its first encounter of the year. Currently second in the Golden Coast Conference with a record of 2-1, this matchup will be crucial for UCSB to have any chance to make that year's end push for the top spot in the conference standings. UCSB will look to retain its form for the remainder of the regular season, as the team recently came off an 11-7 victory against GCC opponent Long Beach State. Throughout all the exhibitions, tournament play and conference matchups, the Gauchos finished with a fair 5-3 record against a strong October schedule. On the year, UCSB is at a combined overall of 17-8, with a 2-3 away record; this is enough to place the Gauchos within the top five programs in the nation, according to NCAA Men's Water Polo rankings. As for the UC Irvine Anteaters, they'll want to find their rhythm fast, as they're fresh off a 10-16 loss to No. 2 Stanford. Their recent stretch of matches didn't go quite so well either, as the Anteaters' finished 3-5 during their campaign in October. Overall on the year, UC Irvine finds itself at 8-11, with a 2-3 home record ""î enough for polls to slot it in as a top 15 program in NCAA rankings. Its GCC record also reflects its subpar showing, as the team is fourth in the conference at 1-2. Historically speaking, this lackluster season for UC Irvine isn't very common at all. In terms of all-time series, the Gauchos have usually been on the other end of things as they trail the Anteaters by a staggering 47-104. Last year, UCSB faced UC Irvine a total of four times and opened up the regular-season play with a clutch 14-12 win in overtime. However, the rest of last season didn't follow suit, as the Gauchos dropped the remaining three matches against the Anteaters. There will be no love lost in this upcoming competition, as the Gauchos will try their best to flip the script and continue their fine form with a win over their UC and GCC opponents to the south. Boris Jovanovic is still the man of the hour for the Gauchos, as the senior driver simply just can't stop scoring.
Coming off another impressive showing, after netting four goals last week against Long Beach State, Jovanovic has a team-leading 71 goals on the season; the next closest in goal count would be junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic with 42, who additionally leads the team in assists with 21 for the year. Jovanovic is also on our radar for his record-breaking scoring pace, as he most recently broke into the single-season column; his 71 goals is enough to have him tied for eighth all-time for the Gauchos, first being Benjamin Gage's total of 91 back in 1970.
With a couple of regular-season matches left on the calendar, and not to mention postseason on the horizon, this is a storyline fans will want to follow very closely. On UCI's side, sophomore utility Jason Evezard is the clear-cut standout as he currently leads in both combined goals and assists.
Obviously the heart of UC Irvine's offense, Evezard's single game high in scoring was seven versus Loyola Marymount University just a few weeks ago. It'll be wise for the Gaucho defense to plan accordingly against Evezard's productive prowess. The Gauchos will head down to UC Irvine this Friday, Nov. 2, as the game is set to start at 7 p.m. sharp. A version of this story appeared on page 7 of the Nov. 1st print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,"One Upset Down, One to Go, for Rolling Gauchos",1-Nov-18,5:00 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/one-upset-down-one-to-go-for-rolling-gauchos/,"Torrie Glasker prepares to spike the ball against Hawaii. Nicole Wallace/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's volleyball team got its biggest win of the season so far last Saturday when they upset Hawaii with a 3-0 sweep in Honolulu. On Friday, the Gauchos will try to one-up that victory when they take on No. 17 Cal Poly in the Thunderdome in the second installment of the Blue-Green Rivalry this season. The first installment didn't go so well for UCSB, as Cal Poly defended their home turf with a sweep of the Gauchos back on October 12. It's a whole new ballgame now, however, with Santa Barbara, now 14-9 and 6-5, coming off of its best win and Cal Poly, at 19-2 and 9-1, coming off of its worst loss. Ironically, both of those matches came against Hawaii. The Gauchos had one of their best defensive matches all season against the Rainbow Warriors in their 3-0 sweep, holding their hosts to a .118 hitting percentage while piling up ten blocks. The Mustangs, on the other hand, lost their first game since August on Friday night in Honolulu in a 3-2 thriller. Just going off of that mutual opponent record, then, the Gauchos have a chance to pull off the major upset on Saturday night. Doing so will require UCSB to keep up its defensive effort, something that the team has struggled to maintain consistently. In fact, the last time the Gauchos put together a stifling defensive performance against Hawaii, they followed it up by allowing Cal Poly to hit at a .386 clip the very next match. A repeat of that defensive performance would be fatal to any hopes UCSB might have for a second upset in a row. The Rainbow Warriors beat the Mustangs with a balanced attack featuring five players with at least eight kills, but it's unlikely the Gauchos will be able to do the same. Instead, UCSB will need repeat performances from Emilia Petrarchi (16 digs against Hawaii) and Nicole Omwanghe (seven total blocks, tied for a season-high) on Friday night. Those two were the linchpins to the Gaucho defensive effort in the first upset and they'll likely have to fill the same role if there's to be a second one. Most of UCSB's defensive attention will likely be focused on Cal Poly's star outside hitter, Torrey Van Winden. The junior is sixth in the nation with 4.97 kills per set and was the Mustangs' only player with double-digit kills against Hawaii last week with 21. Van Winden posted 10 kills against just one attack error the last time Cal Poly took on UCSB, so the Gauchos are quite familiar with what kind of damage the outside hitter can do. They're also well acquainted with how dangerous the rest of the Mustang attack can be. Three other attackers (Adlee Van Winden, Meredith Phillips and Madilyn Mercer) have at least 100 kills this season, and those three encountered little resistance when they faced the Gauchos last. UCSB has a chance to put that rough defensive showing behind them for good with a stronger performance on Friday night. They'll need to show that they can sustain their defensive success, however, or it'll likely feel like a re-run. Of course, the Gauchos will also have to excel offensively if they want to bring down the best team they'll face all year. Star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins faltered a bit against Hawaii with 11 kills on a hitting percentage of just .128, and while her team still picked up the win that'll be a much more difficult task on Friday. Not only will Ruddins have to shine on Friday, but her complementary players will have to back her up as well. The younger Ruddins, Gigi, did an able job of that against Hawaii with 10 kills. The Gauchos will need more of that, as well as strong outings from junior outside hitter Torre Glasker and sophomore middle blocker Rowan Ennis. This past Sunday, October 28, marked the two-year anniversary of the last time UCSB beat Cal Poly. That's daunting, but it's a shorter period than the five years it took to beat Hawaii before last Saturday. The Gauchos ended that losing streak, so why not another? UCSB hosts Cal Poly in the Thunderdome on Friday night at 7 p.m. for the second Blue-Green rivalry game of the season.

sports,"Together Again, Conteh, Michael, Enjoy Bond Like No Other",1-Nov-18,5:15 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/together-again-conteh-michael-enjoy-bond-like-no-other/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Junior defensive midfielder Sahid Conteh and sophomore attacker Rodney Michael's relationship spans two continents and three schools ""î eight years worth of memories that include a CIF title, heartbreaking defeats and countless goals. The latest of these goals came on Saturday, in the Gauchos must-win matchup at Harder Stadium against CSUN. After a lackluster first half, sophomore Kaya Fabbretti scored early in the second half to put UCSB up 1-0 over the visiting Matadors. Against the explosive offense of CSUN, the hosts knew that one goal would likely not be enough. When Conteh picked the ball up on the right wing in the 54th minute, he immediately looked to break, showing off the pace and touch he had curated as a forward earlier in his career. When he reached the box, he picked his head up, laying off a perfect pass to Michael's right foot ""î just as he's done so many times in his soccer career. Michael quickly flicked the ball onto his left foot and blasted a shot to the bottom left corner of the goal. Just like that, it was 2-0 Gauchos. Three years earlier, the duo scored almost an identical goal, where Michael made a run behind the defense and Conteh provided the service. That very goal would give Dunn High School the lead in the CIF championship game ""î† a lead they would never relinquish en-route to the first-ever title in the school's history. Google that game, and one of the first images displays an absolutely jubilant Michael jumping into the arms of Conteh after that goal. Four years prior to that magical moment, before Conteh had ever even seen the United States, the boys met for the first time just outside of their hometown of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Both boys received full-ride scholarships to the Craig Bellamy Academy ""î a boarding school that promised the best players in Sierra Leone a chance to develop their soccer skills. At the time, Michael and Conteh were merely 11 and 13, respectively. The two boys came from vastly different backgrounds. Conteh had never left his native country, and was not always guaranteed three meals a day. Conversely, Michael and his family had travelled to both the United States and Europe. But from that moment, when the two players moved into the academy, their lives would be intertwined for the next eight years. ""úThat was the first time we had ever moved away from our families,""ù Conteh said. ""úFor a lot of us, coming from low-income areas, it was the first time we had our own beds.""ù Conteh also reflects fondly on the long bus rides that team would take, often spanning eight hours as the team drove the entire distance of the country. Conteh remembers messing around with Michael and his teammates, singing joyfully after victories. After spending months on end with each other, Michael and Conteh easily became friends. Their bond extended all the way across the world to Los Olivos, Calif., where in 2013, coaches at Dunn School recruited Conteh to come play at their boarding school. When he first arrived, Conteh struggled to adapt to life in the United States, with his friends telling him later that he ""údidn't say a word""ù during his first three weeks in the States. Eventually, through the help of his coaches, he became acclimated to life in the country. Conteh played well during his freshman and sophomore campaigns; both years, however, the team flamed out in the opening round of the CIF playoffs In 2015, the younger Michael would join him, the duo reunited once again after he was offered a scholarship to play for Dunn. It was here where their bond was truly forged ""î a friendship based on a common upbringing, success on the pitch and a healthy dose of competition. ""úIn high school, we would always compete to see who could score more goals,""ùMichael said. ""úThe first year, when I was a freshman and he was a junior, we scored the same number of goals.""ù He chuckled, before adding, ""úThe next year, I blew him away.""ù Off the pitch, this competitiveness manifests itself mainly in video games; according to them, Conteh wins every time in FIFA, while Michael dominates in Fortnight. On the pitch, however, the two love to banter, making sure the other player knows if they're playing poorly. ""úIt really raises my level of play, knowing that Michael will give me crap if I mess up,""ù Conteh said. It is a system that only works because of the familiarity between the two; both realize that any negative remark is merely in jest. ""úOur high school teammates will still text us if we have a bad game,""ù Michael said. Even during the interview with the two, the playful competition is on display. When I ask Conteh about the assists he's had to Michael this season, he starts laughing, glares at Michael and says, ""úThere should be a lot more than there are!""ù Of course, the two can also be cordial. When asked about his transition to Santa Barbara, Michael discussed the benefit of having a familiar face in Conteh to ease his way into both the team and the college experience. But for defenders who stand in the way of either Sierra Leonean, there is no cordiality. ""úWe love to smack-talk defenders,""ù Conteh said. ""úI remember during the Sacramento State game this year, Michael was bantering with the defender pretty much the whole game. Every time he got the ball, I would yell at him ""òGo, take him on' in our native language of Krio.""ù For a duo that was so resoundingly successful in Sierra Leone and in high school, adjusting to college soccer has been difficult at times. At times, the two have struggled to come to terms with losing, especially after a subpar season last year in which the Gauchos went winless in their first six matches. The star duo have been forced to adjust their mentality, and in some instances, their positions, at Santa Barbara. Growing up, both players played up front, using their pace and precision to blow defenders away. During those years at Dunn, the two would often switch between playing center forward and winger, utilizing the chemistry they had created over the years to torment defenses. While Michael is still tormenting defenses up front, Conteh has been forced to completely adjust his mentality in college. When Conteh transferred from Loyola Marymount University to UCSB last season, the coaching staff asked him to use his speed in a more defensive role. This season, he has slotted in as a central defensive midfielder, patrolling the middle of the field and linking up play between the backline and the forwards. ""úWe have friends and coaches from high school who text us like ""òWho is scoring more goals this year?'""ù Conteh said. ""úI tell them, ""òWell obviously Michael is because I play defense now!'""ù Even Michael at times has had to adjust, switching from central forward to a wider role in order to get the ball deeper and take on defenders. But no matter where the two are positioned on the field, the chemistry they share is evident ""î a chemistry that has been nurtured by eight years of competitive soccer played side-by-side. And through it all, they have used each other as a pillar, a constant that allows them to feel more at home even during the difficult times. Despite their vastly differing roles, both players have demonstrated their quality on the pitch over and over again this season. By far the most consistent offensive player, Michael has already tallied seven goals this season despite defenses consistently double and triple-teaming him. Generating national acclaim for his performance, college soccer news site Top Drawer Soccer named Michael as the 71st best player in the nation during their midseason player rankings. While Conteh may not get the same national attention, his defensive prowess has been one of the key reasons the team has kept two consecutive clean sheets. In Saturday's match, Conteh chased down a Matador that was on a breakaway in the 33rd minute, keeping the match scoreless. Offensively, Conteh is tied for the team lead with three assists, with two of those three contributing to a Michael goal. Now that the Gauchos have found their stride, shooting back up to 43rd in the RPI table, the two may get the opportunity they deserve to shine on a national stage. With the Gauchos' big win in their season finale against Cal Poly, they entered the first round of the Big West Tournament with momentum; however, the team fell to Cal State Fullerton in a match ultimately decided by penalty kicks. Despite the loss, don't count Conteh and Michael out. A lot has changed since their early days in Sierra Leone. What hasn't changed, however, is their ability to score and to dominate all facets of the game. And, if 2015 is any indication, their ability to win a championship in the future hasn't changed either. A version of this story appeared on page 6 of the Nov. 1st print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,UCSB Squanders Home Playoff Game for 2nd Consecutive Season,1-Nov-18,7:50 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-01/ucsb-squanders-home-playoff-game-for-2nd-consecutive-season/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus The UCSB men's soccer team suffered yet another brutal postseason loss in the first round of the Big West Conference, this time to the No. 6 Cal State Fullerton Titans. While the two squads were tied 1-1 at the end of regulation and overtime, UCSB ultimately dropped the match 5-4 in penalty kicks.  The Gauchos ended the season with a 4-2-1 conference and 10-7-1 overall record, while the Titans jumped up to a 2-3-2 conference and 8-5-7 overall record, and now move on to the second round to face off against UC Riverside. Although the result doesn't reflect it, UCSB actually dominated this game from beginning to end. After a hectic first few minutes, the Gauchos were able to settle down and set the tempo of the match.  Forward Thibault Candia stepped up early on, and was able to connect on a few crosses that the other Gaucho attackers were not able to put home. It was actually the Titans who struck first as sophomore Christian Pinzon leaked out on a counterattack and knocked in a left-footed dribbler off the post in the 23rd minute. The goal actually seemed to energize the UCSB offense, and they responded with a beautifully set-up shot by junior Ignacio Tellechea two minutes later. Thibault Candia was able to sneak by multiple Fullerton defenders on the right wing on the lead up to the goal, and sent a hard cross right by the goalie which Tellechea easily slotted into the upper left corner. ""úIt was a collective goal, a collective play,""ù said Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg. ""úYou might say [the set-up to the goal] kind of looked easy, ""òwhy didn't we do more of it?' I guarantee you that there were four or five times where another pass like that could have found somebody open.""ù As the half wore on however, it seemed like the Gauchos had the game in the bag. They more than doubled the Titans shot attempts in the first period, and faced almost no pressure in their own half. The lone bright spot for the Titans to start the second half was freshman Zico Bailey. The midfielder at times seemed to be the only player capable of creating a play for Fullerton, and his energy on the offensive end helped his teammates conserve theirs for defense. The Gauchos still maintained control of the game throughout the second half, and wide open misses by forwards Rodney Michael and Ignacio Tellechea in the 47th and 53rd minutes seemed to be leading up to an inevitable goal. This goal never came however, and UCSB faced an overtime matchup for the second year in a row. ""úIf you follow Gaucho soccer, scoring goals this year has always been an issue for us,""ù explained Vom Steeg. ""úAnd that didn't exactly go away.""ù Once again the Gauchos dominated the ball to start off overtime. Sophomore Rodney Michael missed a few good opportunities to put the game away, including a one on one with only four minutes left against Fullerton goalie Paul-Andre Guerin which he skied to the right. As he laid on the floor for a few seconds after, it seemed like the first cracks were appearing in the Gauchos' armor just as penalty kicks were set to start. Even so, UCSB had an opportunity to put the game away in PK's. Big West Co-Freshman of the Year Ben Roach was close to making a few stops for the Gauchos, yet a miss over the bar by Tellechea eventually dashed any hopes they had of advancing. At the end, it was the Titans who had a fairy tale ending at Harder Stadium. Although it would have been great for UCSB to advance deep into the Big West tournament, especially because of the fact that Harder will be host to the NCAA Championship game in December, the Gauchos ultimately should hold their heads up high. A combination of solid conference play with explosive young talent will make this team dangerous for many years to come.

The veteran-heavy Gauchos have all-to-often relied on crunch time goals during their captivating run in the Big West this year, but with their season on the line, freshman Hannah Wendelken took matters into her own hands. A mere 20 seconds after the opening whistle, Wendelken found a streaking junior winger Katherine Sheehy who won a contested ball from Irvine in the midfield and fed Wendelken with a find about 35 yards out. Wendelken, a former UCSB Club Soccer product, blasted an absolute strike to the top left-hand corner that zipped past a diving UCI keeper Maddie Newsom to give the Gauchos life with a 1-0 lead. ""ú[Wendelken's] role is kind of a bench player. A lot of the girls that get into that role, you can see that they concede; they stop working as hard in training,""ù Expressed Head Coach Paul Stumpf in his twentieth season. ""úHannah on the other hand kept a high level the entire time""¶She hit an absolute bomb tonight; she smashed that ball. Hannah can give us a 25-30-minute shift and she did exceptionally well.""ù The Gauchos had a chance to pile it on in the 37th minute as midfielder Christine Maurer drove down the touchline to deliver a chance at goal as Newsom stretched to make a fingertip save and keep it a tight, single-goal match. Just a minute later, junior winger and Gaucho shot leader Shaelan Murison slipped past the right wing to deliver look for senior captain Mallory Hromatko who directed a cross that kissed the goalmouth as it skipped wide left. Although both UCSB and Irvine rounded off the half with 3 shots a piece, the Gauchos remained in control with more promising looks and a 1-0 lead with only a half separating them and a berth into the Big West Championship Final. ""úWhen we did bring pressure, we did a pretty good job of advancing the ball down the field,""ù recalled Coach Stumpf postgame. ""úThey scored both of their goals in the first game on a couple of mistakes by us. I think the girls had to deal with a whole lot of set pieces that were dumped in the box and they managed it very well.""ù The Anteaters best chances on the night came with consecutive breaks in the 62nd and 63rd minutes. Junior Keeper Hannah DeWeese maintained her shutout with two game-saving stops to keep the ""òChos in control by a goal. While Murison couldn't get a look off in the first half, the winger took command in the second half as she peppered 7 chances at goal. The No. 2 goal-scorer in the Big West had four straight looks for UCSB in the 73rd, 76th, 85th, and 87th minutes as she looked to add some insurance to the single-goal lead. The Anteaters made a last-ditch effort to revive their season with a free kick in the minute 90, but her look was blocked by the Gauchos wall and cleared out of the defensive zone to ultimately ensure a 1-0 UCSB triumph. ""úThe toughness, the character, the resiliency that the team showed""¶ it was so impressive,""ù remarked Stumpf following the win. ""úWe're really overjoyed at the prospect of winning the Big West tournament. This is exactly where we want to be and we're very fortunate to be here.""ù With the victory in Irvine on Thursday, the Gauchos vaulted into the Big West Tournament final as they face off against Long Beach State at Anteater Stadium on Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m. for the title of Big West Conference Champions.

Also, UCSB defeated LBSU the last time the two teams met in a conference final in 2008. Photo Courtesy of UCSB Athletics. Only one team stands in the way of the UCSB women's soccer team and its first Big West Conference title since 2009, Long Beach State. With a win on Sunday, Santa Barbara will claim its third conference crown in program history. The Gauchos are in the conference title game following a gutsy 1-0 win against UC Irvine on Thursday in the Big West Semifinal. Similarly, the 49ers punched their ticket to the final following their own 1-0 win against UC Davis a couple of hours earlier. This is UCSB's fifth appearance in the title game and the sixth appearance for LBSU. No. 2 seeded UCSB comes into the contest with an overall mark of 12-6-1 and a 5-2-1 league record while top-seeded Long Beach boasts a 10-5-3 overall mark and a 5-2-1 Big West record. Long Beach has had great success against Santa Barbara winning eight of the last 10 matches over the past decade, including a 2-0 win this season the 49ers enjoyed at home. UCSB did win last years matchup, however, 3-0. Additionally, this will also be the second time these two teams have met in the Big West Championship with the first match favoring the Gauchos in penalty kicks back in 2008. If the Gauchos hope to repeat that favorable outcome then it will definitely need to rely on some of their star offensive players that have carried them all season. Junior forward Shaelan Murison definitely fills this role. Murison has scored 10 goals on the year, the second most in the Big West. Additionally, her 24 total points also rank second in the league. UCSB will also need to rely on Mallory Hromatko and Katherine Sheehy whose six assists and five assists rank first and second in the Big West, respectively. In addition, Hromatko also fulfills a tremendous role on the defensive end as she constantly makes her presence†felt when the opposing team tries to enter top third of the field. The senior was also named All-Big West First Team for her performance this season alongside Murison. The offense will need to be running on all cylinders as they face off against the Big West Defensive Player of the Year, senior defender Sarah Maher. Maher helped Long Beach State post the conference's third-lowest team goals against average (0.86) and also contributed†to the teams five total shutouts all season. Defensively, junior goalkeeper Hannah DeWeese will also need to play a key role for the Gauchos. She has certainly improved her play as the pressure has mounted allowing just three goals in the last five contests while tallying 17 saves. She has a total of 57 saves on the year. She will face a flurry of tough Long Beach State scorers beginning with the programs all-time leading goal scorer, Ashley Gonzalez. The senior has tallied six goals this year to lead the team in that category and also added two assists. In her career, Gonzalez has scored 34 goals. Fellow senior Dana Fujikuni will also look to finish her career out the right way. The midfielder was voted the league's best midfielder of the year and has tallied five goals and four assists on the year. Gonzalez and Fujikuni played the biggest role in fueling LBSU's potent offense which was ranked No. 1 in assists (31) and in points (91) and No. 2 in goals scored (30). UCSB's match against LBSU will be a tough one, but if the Gauchos have proven anything in the past few weeks they have shown that the pressure has yet to get the best of them. A few weeks ago Santa Barbara was in danger of missing the tournament for the third straight year but tough, determined play helped them win five of its last seven ball games to put them in position to win a title. Now, the Gauchos just need to win one more game to finally claim a Big West title since the turn of the decade and earn a berth to the NCAA Tournament. It won't be easy, but nothing worth winning is. UCSB will face LBSU at 1 p.m. on Sunday, November 4 at Anteater Stadium. The game can also be streamed on bigwest.tv.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The wait is finally over and the sense of excitement among fans is tremendous, as the start of a new men's basketball season is underway.  As with any new campaign, expectations are high for the Gauchos, and a win on the road would indicate improvement off of last year's strong performance. Up first on UCSB's calendar is a competitive Wyoming side, who picked up a win in their exhibition game against Colorado Christian University earlier this week. † Last season, UCSB put up a 23-9 overall record on the year, with a 12-2 home record, a 9-6 record when away and a 2-1 record at neutral sites. This impressive result landed the 2017-18 squad into the history books as it tied the team record for most games won in a single season.  The team's conference record of 11-5 was also good enough for a second-place seeding in Big West standings. The Gauchos concluded this campaign with a postseason semifinal showing, as the team exited the Big West Tournament earlier than anticipated. As for the Wyoming Cowboys, they finished with a 20-13 overall last season, during which they went 12-4 at home, 5-7 on the road and a neutral of 3-2. Their performance during conference play, however, wasn't as compelling since their 10-8 record against Mountain West opponents placed them at a fifth-place seeding. Subsequently, Wyoming's postseason aspirations ended in Game 2 exit after falling 75-85 to third-place New Mexico. † Historically speaking, the UCSB versus Wyoming matchup isn't too common, but both programs are familiar with each other. The last time these two sides met was back in 2012's regular season, during which UCSB fell 68-40. In terms of all-time series record, the Gauchos only trail the Cowboys by 2-4 and will look to chip away at that lead come game time. There's a lot to be excited about for this new men's basketball team, as with the departure of last year's familiar faces comes the introduction of new names to cheer on. The three prospective freshmen to keep track of this year are forwards Jay Nagle and Amadou Sow and guard S√©kou Tour√©. Additionally, when you pair fresh talent with a veteran presence, you get a team led by junior guard Max Heidegger.  As the team's forefront playmaker, Heidegger started all 32 games last year and earned a team-leading stat line of 19.1 points per game on a field goal percentage of 43.2 percent and three-point percentage of 40.4 percent.  For added context, his impressive season was at a record-breaking pace in four different columns, under the ""úIndividual Single Season""ù category, as Heidegger found himself fifth in points scored (612), 10th in scoring average (19.1), fourth in field goals attempted (451) and first in three-point field goals (95).  Per these statistical breakdowns, the offense will move through Heidegger and he'll once again complement the Gauchos with his scoring production. Heidegger was also recently named to the 2018-19 Big West Men's Basketball Preseason All-Conference Team for his actions and expected impact on UCSB's upcoming season. In charge of it all from the sidelines is Joe Pasternack, head coach of the Gauchos. Pasternack will want to leave another lasting impression for his legacy this season, in his second year at UCSB, after also coming off an immense coaching job that set up his team's historic 23-9 finish. His and his staff's immediate impact helped reintroduce a winning culture to UCSB as he became the program's ""úMost Successful First-Year Coach.""ù Tipoff to the new men's basketball season starts Tuesday night, Nov. 6, at 7 p.m., as Wyoming is set to host UCSB at the Arena-Auditorium in Laramie, Wyo.

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus For the second consecutive season, the UCSB men's basketball team posted a convincing win in their season opener as the Gauchos served up a late 14-6 scoring run to earn a 76-66 road victory over the Wyoming Cowboys on Tuesday evening. With star junior guard Max Heidegger out of the lineup, JaQuori McLaughlin assumed the starting two-guard role as he put up 17 points on 5-13 shooting from the field, including going 1-6 from the perimeter. The Oregon State transfer added three rebounds and two assists to lead Santa Barbara to a 1-0 start this season. McLaughlin was accompanied in the back court by sophomore captain point guard Devearl Ramsey, who shined in his first game as a Gaucho. The Sierra Canyon High School product balanced the UCSB offense with a team-high four assists in addition to his 14 points while going 3 of 6 from the field. Ramsey dragged down six rebounds in 29 minutes as the captain nabbed his first win in a Gaucho uniform. Starting at center for the Gauchos was standout freshman forward Amadou Sow, †who recorded eight points on 40 percent shooting and brought down 11 rebounds in his first college game. Senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon added a healthy eight points on 3-4 shooting in addition to eight boards and a game-high three blocks. Rounding out the starting five was graduate guard Ar'mond Davis, who tacked on six points over 19 minutes while shooting 2-7 from the field. Senior guard Justin James led the attack from the Cowboys as he played the entire 40 minutes tonight while adding 20 points on 5-14 shooting and 11 rebounds. James also distributed four assists for the top mark for Wyoming, as it dropped the home opener to move to 0-1 on the year. Sophomore guard Hunter Maldonado scored 12 points for the Cowboys while shooting 33 percent from the field, while freshman forward Hunter Thompson shot an impressive 67 percent from the field and added 10 points over 15 minutes. The Gauchos got off to a hot start as McLaughlin scored or assisted on seven of the Gauchos' first eight points in the game within the first five minutes. As the 'Chos hung onto an 8-7 lead, UCSB hit its stride as Ramsey and freshman forward Jay Nagle knocked down back-to-back threes to put SB up 14-7. Wyoming answered back with a commanding 12-3 run to take a 19-17 lead with 8:40 on the clock in the first half. A minute later, junior guard Zack Moore delivered a quick-release three-pointer to regain a one-point edge. On the ensuing possession, Cowboy guard Hunter Maldonado responded with a deep three of his own to retake the lead. Immediately after, Jay Nagle countered with another three for the Gauchos to put them up 23-22. Nagle chimed in with a perfect 3 of 3 from the field as the freshman led the Gauchos bench with nine points and three rebounds. Coupled with Moore, the two combined for 15 points off the bench to take charge of the second rotation. UCSB entered the half with a 39-35 lead following a scoring frenzy from JaQuori McLaughlin, who added the final seven points in the half. McLaughlin capped off his run with a cross-over dribble drive as he drew contact on the basket and capitalized on the one opportunity to put the Gauchos up by four with only three seconds remaining in the half. SB maintained control of the pace out of the break, as four Gauchos scored during a 10-3 run with 12:30 remaining in the contest to seize a 55-44 lead. The Cowboys contested with a 12-2 run of their own as they cut the lead to just one with eight minutes left. Just when it seemed as if the Cowboys had muscled their way back into the ball game, Nagle knocked down his third dagger of the game, which set up a 19-10 finish over the final eight-minute frame to propel the 'Chos over Wyoming with a 76-66 triumph. Following a 2017-18 season in which UCSB struggled to consistently get production from the bench, the Gauchos finally appear to have substantial talent and depth at every position. The SB bench shot a polished 7-7 from the field, including a perfect 5-5 from three-point range. UCSB took a ginormous leap forward after having limited bench production last season, which ultimately led to its demise in the Big West Tournament as the bench only scored one point in the semifinals loss against UC Irvine. Although it's not reflected on the stat sheet, Christian Terrell seemed to make a significant impact every time he checked into the game. An instant boost of energy, Terrell tallied 23 minutes off the bench and converted a three-point play to keep the Gauchos on top midway through the second half. The Gauchos continue their road trip on Sunday afternoon in Fargo, N.D., as UCSB takes on North Dakota State at Scheels Arena at 1 p.m.

Jovanovic currently leads the team in scoring and has been instrumental in Santa Barbara's dramatic turnaround from last season.†Not only has he been an offensive force, but he has also brought stable leadership for the team as the only senior on the roster. The Waves come into this game on a three-game winning streak, with an overall record of 15-10, in which they have outscored their opponents by an average of seven goals per tournament.†In their most recent matchup against Santa Clara, they were able to net 17 goals while only allowing six. Freshman attacker Balazs Kosa led Pepperdine with a career-high seven goals in the match. It has been an up-and-down season for Pepperdine, but they have seemed to have found their rhythm as of late, specifically offensively.†Behind Kosa and senior center Chris Dilworth, the duo has been able to constantly put pressure on their opponents, leading to not only many goals for each player but also assists ""î they have over 30 assists between the two of them. Both Pepperdine and Santa Barbara are very familiar with each other as they had matched up earlier in the season, with the Gauchos grabbing the win narrowly by a score of 16-14. Jovanovic led UCSB with six goals in their previous matchup.
UCSB will look to continue its strong defensive performance, as it has held its past two opponents under 10 goals.†With the Waves playing its† best on the year, the Gauchos' defense must communicate effectively, particularly when facing power plays. Throughout the year, the Gauchos have struggled to keep the ball out of the back of their net when being a man down, primarily due to defensive breakdowns. If they are able to limit them, they will be in prime position for defensive stops, which could lead to offensive success for them through fastbreaks. With all of the Waves' attention certainly going toward stopping Jovanovic and junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic, other members on the UCSB team must step up in order to keep a strong defense.† Freshman attacker Sam Nangle and freshman driver Nathan Puentes were able to score in their last game, and it is prospected that the duo will make an impact in the last home game of the season for the ""òChos. By maintaining constant pressure on the opponent's half of the pool, they will be able to increase their amount of shots on goal, inevitably leading to more goals scored. As Santa Barbara wraps up the season, it will have the potential to increase its win count by eight games in comparison to last year.†Many attribute the turnaround to the team's selfless nature. Twelve players currently have more than 10 goals on the year, making the Gauchos extremely difficult to defend, since every player in the pool is an offensive threat.† Looking to pick up its fourth win at home on the year, UCSB will play Pepperdine at 12 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 10, in Jovanovic's last home game as a Gaucho.

sports,"Heidegger, Ramsey Lead the Charge for Coach Pasternack",8-Nov-18,12:15 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/84817/,"Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus With Head Coach Joe Pasternack at the helm in his second season, the UCSB men's basketball team looks to take a step toward a playoff berth into March Madness for the first time since 2011. The Gauchos tied a program-best 23-9 record last season in Pasternack's first year as the SB Head Coach. Following the 2016-17 season when the Gauchos recorded the worst single season in program history with a feeble six wins, Pasternack took the reins to deliver a 17-win difference in 2018. The win differential was the largest single-season turnaround in NCAA history. Led by First Team All-Big West player Max Heidegger, the Gaucho offense produced the highest single-season point total in program history as Heidegger added 95 three-pointers, which totaled the most by a UCSB player in a single year. Now a composed junior guard, Heidegger was named to the preseason All-Big West Conference Team as the only Gaucho starter to return from the historic 2018 squad.
Although four starters departed after last season, Santa Barbara has added a myriad of newcomers headlined by captain sophomore point guard Devearl Ramsey. The Sierra Canyon product appears to have earned himself a starting role after being named as a team captain before playing a single regular-season game in the Gaucho blue. ""úLast year I tried to watch what the guys were doing and see where I could fit in and how I could make my impact,""ù Ramsey recalled about the transition to UCSB. ""úWe all have a chip on our shoulders and we all just want to be the best; we haven't really hit a wall yet.""ù Ramsey, along with junior guard Zack Moore, redshirted during the previous season after transferring from the University of Nevada and Seattle University respectively.
The extra year of development in the Gaucho system puts each of them in a prime spot to fluidly mesh with the new-look rotations. ""úWe're not naive that this is going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time,""ù Associate Coach John Rillie said. ""úWe lost some really good players from last year's team, and replacing them with young guys""¶ that'll take a little time, but all are willing learners.""ù Santa Barbara also added graduate Alabama guard Armond Davis, sophomore forward Robinson Idehen out of Trinity Valley CC and sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin from Oregon State. ""úIt's a big change from high school to college, from junior college to Division I,""ù the towering 6'10""ù Idehen said. ""úThey wanted me to come here to have a rebounding role and be energetic. I've worked on my shot a lot and my touch around the rim; we've been working on that since the summer""¶ I just want to out-hustle everybody. Whether it's going up to get rebounds in the air or my speed running down the floor ""î getting fast breaks, playing fast pace.""ù Idehen's height puts him among the tallest on the Gaucho squad this season as he strives to complement fellow big man and senior forward Ami Lakoju.†Lakoju spent the summer nursing a foot injury, but the post-up facilitator looks ready to go for tip-off on Tuesday evening. Other returners for the Gauchos include senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon, senior forward Maxwell Kupchak, junior guard Christian Terrell and junior forward Andrew Pickles. Following the changing of the roster over the summer, Christian Terrell has assumed a significant leadership role as he fuses together the new Gauchos. ""úI feel like CT: Christian Terrell, he's helped me out a lot too with going over the offense,""ù Ramsey said. ""úThose older guys like [Jarriesse], like Max [Heidegger] my roommate ""î those guys all made my transformation easier.""ù With leaders like Heidegger, Ramsey and Terrell in place, the coaching staff went out and recruited top-tier freshmen without worrying about their transition into the program. Over the summer, the Gauchos added Prolific Prep. High School standouts forward Amadou Sow and guard S√©kou Tour√© along with forward Jay Nagle, who played at Will C. Wood High School. Sow has long been one of the highest-coveted big men in his recruiting class; while Tour√©'s lengthy wingspan forecasts him as one of the top defensive stoppers on the roster. Nagle was recruited as a 6'6""ù forward, but over the summer, the freshman sprouted up an additional two inches to tower at 6'8""ù just in time for the start of the season. ""úThey're all the best players on their teams from where they're coming from, but that's not necessarily the case once they get to college,""ù Rillie said. ""úThey have to understand how hard they've got to play. Simple things like running back in defensive transition ""î as simple as some skills seem ""î they're a little harder to execute if you're not giving the effort.""ù Projected to finish fourth in the Big West, the Gauchos kicked off their season opener with a 76-66 win in Laramie, Wyo., on Tuesday, over the University of Wyoming.

sports,New-Look Women's Basketball Seeks to Defy Expectations,8-Nov-18,5:10 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/new-look-womens-basketball-seeks-to-defy-expectations/,"Nina Radford plays defense. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After being pegged to finish at No. 7 in the Big West preseason poll, Head Coach Bonnie Hendrickson and the UCSB women's basketball team will be looking to defy all expectations when they kick off their season this week. Last season, the Gauchos stumbled out of the gate, starting off the season 3-10 before going a respectable 9-7 in conference play ""î good enough for fourth in the conference. However, their season ended prematurely when they were upset at home by CSUN. This year, Santa Barbara will be tasked with the challenge of replacing its top three leading scores from last season. In particular, the Gauchos will need someone to step up in the absence of Drew Edelman, who led the team with 16.2 points per game. Despite fielding a relatively inexperienced front court, UCSB boasts an experienced backcourt, with sophomore Danae Miller, last season's starting point guard, returning to allow some continuity. In addition, the team will welcome back junior Coco Miller, who missed all of last season due to injury. Two years ago, however, Miller averaged 9.1 per game. Miller also will allow the Gauchos to stretch the defense, as her 111 three pointers made are already the seventh most in program history. If the exhibition game against Cal St. San Bernardino was any evidence, the team will likely use a committee approach to filling Edelman's presence. Junior center Natalia Bruning led the team last Monday with 18 points and 15 rebounds, while sophomore guard Bri Anugwom chipped in 15 points on 5-8 shooting from the floor. Anugwom, a community college transfer who scored 20 points per game for West Los Angeles CC, should provide a solid scoring spark for the team off the bench. With a tough non-conference schedule, Hendrickson will need the seven new faces on the team this season to get acclimated to Division 1 basketball quickly. The Gauchos' biggest test will come Nov. 15 when they travel to Los Angeles to take on USC. Later in the non-conference slate, Santa Barbara is also scheduled to take on UNLV, St. Mary's, Cal and San Diego State. The team's schedule won't get any easier when they open up conference play against CSUN on Jan. 5, with the Matadors picked first in the preseason Big West coaches poll. In that game, the Gauchos will be looking to avenge their tournament loss from last season. They weren't able to avoid a loss in their first game at Utah Valley, falling 63-54 to the Wolverines. The lone bright spot for UCSB on Tuesday night was Natalaia Bruening's 20 point, 11 rebound performance on 9 of 14 shots. Without Edelman in the lineup this season, there's potential for Bruening to break out as the team's primary scoring option down low. Santa Barbara will have the chance to get its season back on track when it takes on CSU Bakersfield at home this weekend. Last season, the Roadrunners went 18-14 overall, falling just short in the WAC tournament final. The team returns without its leading scorer from last season, senior forward Aja Williams, who averaged nearly 13 points a game off the bench last season. Where Bakersfield dominated last season was on the defensive end, giving up only 56 points per game to its opponents while causing nearly 18 turnovers per game. While the Roadrunners scored merely 61 points per game last year, their solid defense enabled them to go 10-4 in the conference. The last time these two teams met was in 2015 when Santa Barbara came away with a 61-60 victory. Ironically enough, that game was Hendrickson's first game in charge of the Gauchos. UCSB will look to repeat that success on Friday, eager to avoid the slow start that plagued the team last season. For a young and inexperienced Gaucho team, building confidence in non-conference play will be key. In a wide-open Big West conference, anything is possible ""î all UCSB needs is a couple players to step up in the absence of Edelman. If they can do that, look for Santa Barbara to surpass expectations this season. A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 08, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus

sports,Women's Volleyball Still Fighting In Final Stretch of Big West Play,8-Nov-18,5:00 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-08/womens-volleyball-still-fighting-in-final-stretch-of-big-west-play/,"Nexus File Photo As the regular season winds down, the UCSB women's volleyball team isn't playing for a playoff spot. At 6-6 in Big West play and 14-10 overall, the team's next four games will be its last in 2018. However, that doesn't mean the Gauchos don't have anything to play for. One more conference win would equal their seven-win total from last season, and fourth place, currently held by the 8-5 UC Davis Aggies, is within reach. But just because it's in reach doesn't mean it will be easy. UCSB must more or less close out its season with four wins in a row, starting this week with matches at UC Irvine on Thursday and at Davis on Saturday. Neither opponent will be easy for the Gauchos to defeat. Both teams beat UCSB the first time around, with Irvine pulling off a contentious 3-1 victory back in mid-September and Davis battling back from a 2-0 set deficit to steal a 3-2 win in the Thunderdome just over a month ago. Both matches were close ones that UCSB had its chances to win, which should give the team some hope going into the week. On the other hand, matching up with the two will only be harder when the Gauchos take their show on the road this week. First up is Irvine, the third-place Big West team with a 15-10 overall record and a 9-4 record in conference play. The Anteaters started Big West play on a tear with six wins in their first seven games, but they have cooled off recently, going 3-3 since. UCSB is sort of a tune-up for Irvine, who closes its season with matches against first-place Cal Poly and second-place Hawaii. The opportunity exists, then, for the Gauchos to take advantage of what may be a sort of trap game for the forward-looking Anteaters. Irvine has a balanced attack with no one player standing out. Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Loryn Carter leads the team with 2.91 kills per set, but four other players have around two kills per set as well. One of those players, Abby Marjama, has excelled in Big West play with 3.07 kills per set. The Gauchos struggled to stop that balanced attack the first time around, something they'll have to improve upon to win on Thursday night. UCSB will also have to replicate its own balanced performance from that first matchup, when Charlie Robinson and Torre Glasker backed up Lindsey Ruddins's 23 kills with double-digit totals of their own. There won't be much time for UCSB to regroup after its Thursday match. The Gauchos will have to travel back up the state to Davis almost immediately in order to take on the Aggies on Saturday night. When they do so, they'll be seeking to avenge their incredible collapse in late September. Saturday's match will also be Senior Night for Davis's class of seniors, a group that includes standout outside hitter Emily Allen. Allen leads the Aggies in kills per set with 3.76 this year and is 15th in the Big West with 2.99 digs per set. Allen is also a Santa Barbara native and the sister of UCSB's Chloe Allen. Senior Night, then, will likely be extra special for the Allen family. The Gauchos will have to overcome any sort of emotional lift UCD may get from their departing seniors in order to win. UCSB established clearly that it can beat the Aggies in their first matchup, but the Gauchos have to actually close the deal and do it on the road this time around. A repeat performance from junior middle blocker Charlie Robinson, who had a career-high 22 kills in the first UCD-UCSB clash, would go a long way for the Gauchos on their quest for vengeance. Robinson hasn't broken double-digits in the kills category in any game since, however, so UCSB may need to find new sources of offense in order to win. If the Gauchos can do that against Davis on Saturday and stifle the balanced attack of Irvine on Thursday, they'll stand a chance of sweeping the week and besting their conference mark of last season. Playoffs might be out of the picture, but there's still plenty to play for. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Nov. 11, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus

sports,Gauchos Drop Home Opener to CSUB,10-Nov-18,1:59 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-10/gauchos-drop-home-opener-to-csub/,"Nexus File Photo Even with a dominant showing in the fourth quarter, the UCSB women's basketball team lost a hard fought game to the CSUB Roadrunners 56-48 on Friday night. The Gauchos dropped to 0-2 with the loss, while Bakersfield is still perfect with a 2-0 record after the win. The game seemed like it was going to go down to the wire from the jump.  Both teams traded shots the first quarter, yet the whistles were the dominant narrative. There were 12 foul calls for both teams combined in the quarter, and although the Gauchos were only able to knock down one field goal, their six free throws helped keep them in the game at 8-12 when the quarter was over. One issue for UCSB that was apparent in the first and never really went away was the focus on lateral ball movement compared to penetration in the paint.  Guards Paris Jones and Coco Miller were tasked with most of the ball-handling in the first half, yet instead of driving the ball in, they either hoisted threes or swung the ball to the wing, and in a game where shots were not falling, this lead to a quiet offense for most of the half. ""úWe don't get good looks, we don't get offensive rebounds until we start to drive the ball,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úWe needed to get paint touches and force the defense to rotate.""ù Bakersfield did not have this problem, as the Roadrunners went on a big run to start off the second quarter. Behind a strong showing by redshirt senior guard JJ Johnson, who would finish with a solid 10 points and three assists, Bakersfield was able to use interior touches to open up the three-point line.  This lead to a 20-6 run in favor of the Roadrunners to close out the half with a 32-14 lead.  The only blemish for the team was their inability to stop fouling, which gave the Gauchos at least a semblance of offensive production from the foul line. UCSB would eventually finish 23-31 from the line compared to 12-17 for Bakersfield, and free throws played a huge role in keeping the door open for a Gaucho comeback. The third quarter was similar to the first in that both teams seemed content to trade buckets. UCSB was able to whittle down the lead a bit, thanks to the energy of sophomore guard Bri Anugwom. Anugwom only finished the game with nine points on 2-9 shooting, yet her rebounding and interior presence helped jumpstart the UCSB offense when it needed it the most. ""úBri drove it downhill, got an and one. If you're gonna get back you gotta make threes, you gotta score quick and you gotta score free throws,""ù coach Henrickson said. ""úAnd we got a combination of all three of those [From Anugwom].""ù This energy seemed to be contagious, and about midway through the last quarter the Gauchos finally started humming on offense. Baskets from freshmen Kiana Vierra and Megan Ormiston provided much-needed points from the bench, and gave the starters some space to create for themselves. UCSB went on a run of their own to cut what was originally a 20-point lead to just two points with a little over a minute to go in the game off of free throws by junior center Natalia Bruening. With the departure of scoring machine Drew Edelman from the team this year, Bruening will have to pick up the slack from the center position. She struggled with the Roadrunner bigs early on, but as she got settled (and they got in foul trouble), Natalia was able to impose her will in the paint late in the game. It ended up being a case of too little, too late, however, as after Anugwom missed a potentially game-tying layup with just a minute to go, the Roadrunners were able to hold on to the ball and make the Gauchos play the fouling game, which led to the 56-48 final score. Ultimately, it was a good sign moving forward for the Gauchos to display the fight that they did when down 20 points. The key now will be finding a way to channel that energy into their starts, and ensuring that they won't always have to come back to finish.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Men's basketball is set for its Thunderdome debut this week, as a premiere win for the Gauchos would also result in a win for the fans. The new season is still young, but the goal remains the same: Earn these regular-season wins before the conference matchups begin; a potential NCAA Tournament bid is dependent on an entirely successful year. Although we are still a couple months away from Big West Conference play, UCSB keeps its focus on this visiting Cal Lutheran side. Starting their season on the road, the Gauchos are primed and ready for their short home stay. Entering this one, the Gauchos currently stand at a 1-1 overall in their young campaign. The hosts are also coming off a recent defeat to their previous opponents, North Dakota State, whom they fell short to by a score of 82-63. UCSB will want to return to its winning ways in front of fans as it eagerly awaits tipoff versus its neighbors to the south. As for Cal Lutheran, its season has just begun as the Kingsmen will be playing their first game of the year at the Thunderdome; this will be their first matchup of a two-game road trip before they debut at home on Saturday. Cal Lutheran is coming off a disappointing campaign, as their last season's record concluded at 9-15, with a total win percentage of only .375.  This also translates to a poor performance in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC), as Cal Lutheran finished 6-10 against opponents, which was good enough for a sixth-place finish in SCIAC conference standings. The Kingsmen will be looking for an upset win on the road in order to start their new season on the right foot. Historically, this is the first time these two teams will be facing off against each other. Still, there will be no love lost as both men's basketball programs are looking to take control of their destinies this early on in the year. Early standout players, for the Gauchos, would be sophomore guards JaQuori McLaughlin and Devearl Ramsey. It's been the underclassmen show so far ""î the pair has combined for 54 points through the first two matches of the season. McLaughlin is currently shooting 100 percent from the free-throw line, with a perfect stat line of 11-11 from the charity stripe.  As for Ramsey, he's shooting at an even 50 percent field goal percentage, currently hitting 7-14 from inside the arc. This young sophomore duo has not only been electric but also a key component for the Gauchos, as they have a team-leading amount of minutes played at 64 and 62, respectively. At the forward position, the Gauchos are also finding success in freshman Amadou Sow, who has found plenty of playing time already, with 55 minutes already under his belt through his first pair of collegiate starts. He's also made the most of his time so far as he leads UCSB in total rebounds, with 13, and is tied with Ramsey in total steals, with two apiece.  Although the young prospects are already proving their talent, the Gauchos' lineup also boasts a veteran presence with senior Jarriesse Blackmon. Only one rebound away from tying with Sow, Blackmon has also dominated the forward position with a team-leading three blocks to his name. The consistency from this rim-protecting and playmaking duo will be crucial to the Gauchos' extended success down the line. Attending fans should have plenty to be excited about, as tip-off against Cal Lutheran is set at 7 p.m. tonight at the Thunderdome.

Santa Barbara improved to 2-1 after the home opener. The 56-point route of the Kingsmen was the largest win margin in UCSB history, beating the previous mark of 55 points set against Cal Poly Pomona in 1971. The Kingsmen dropped their season opener to move to 0-1 on the year. Freshman forward Amadou Sow burst out of the gate with the first seven points of the contest capped off on a feed from sophomore JaQuori McLaughlin. It didn't take long for McLaughlin to get in on the scoring action, as he splashed a three to put the Gauchos up 10-0 after only a minute and a half of action. Sow glowed in his first game at the Thunderdome, as he finished with 15 points and a game-high 83 percent shooting from the field in a mere 14 minutes of playing time. After a half of play, Sow was 4-4 on shooting with 13 points. The Prolific Prep alum added seven boards during the short start, including five rebounds in the first half. On the other end of the floor, the Kingsmen were held to just 15.7 percent from the field as their shooting struggles plagued them throughout the night. Cal Lu posted just 21 points from field goals while they knocked down a cold 3 of 25 from three-point range. ""úWe have to be a lockdown defensive team for us to be successful,""ù Head Coach Joe Pasternack expressed postgame. ""úMy whole focus is to prepare our team to give incredible effort defensively on every single possession; the rest will take care of itself. I think we did that tonight.""ù The Gauchos continued to pile it on with a 15-2 scoring run as UCSB led 31-8 with 10 minutes to play in the first half. Junior guard Christian Terrell and sophomore captain Devearl Ramsey spearheaded the Gaucho attack from the backcourt as the duo shot 5-7 in the first half. Terrell finished with a perfect shooting night, going 4-4 from the field while adding eight points and three steals in the process. UCSB finished off the half with an 8-2 run as Gauchos were on top 50-15 at the break. Senior forward Ami Lakoju powered the 'Chos in the final minutes of the half as he recorded 10 points in five minutes before the whistle. ""úI'm here to help the team and do what I can,""ù Lakoju stated. ""úI'm here to help out, and if they want to keep going to me, I'm going to put the ball up ""¶ We have help coming off the bench, and moving forward we don't have to rely on the starting five.""ù The big men off the bench put on a show for the home crowd as Lakoju posted a game-high 16 points while his frontcourt counterpart, sophomore Robinson Idehen, added 10 points. Idehen and Amadou Sow combined for six blocks in the post as each of them contributed three apiece. ""úWe really had to get the ball inside. I thought we had a big size advantage,""ù Pasternack asserted about his game plan. ""úWe had to move the ball. The ball was too stagnant; we were dribbling too much against North Dakota State.""ù Thirsty to stack the stat sheet, the Gauchos attack featured more of the same offensive success with different faces producing. 12 out of 13 Gauchos scored a basket as the bench delivered a monstrous 53-point performance. None of the five starters played more than five minutes in the second half, as Pasternack valued the opportunity to develop the newcomers with extra playing time. ""úAll of our guys have worked so hard in practice each day to prepare themselves,""ù Coach Pasternack said. ""úTo have a deeper team really helps us. We don't have to play 35 minutes a game like we did last year ""¶ It's huge to be able to go 10 deep; I think it's really going to be beneficial when we get to March.""ù The moment of the game came at the end of the contest when sophomore walk-on Scotty Harris contributed two baskets in the final four-minute frame as he got his first live-game court time as a Gaucho. Following the scoring spree, UCSB looks to keep the attack sharp as the 1-2 Montana State Bobcats stroll into town on Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. to take on the 2-1 Gauchos at the Thunderdome.

In their first two games (both losses) the Gauchos have averaged a meager 51 points per game. In their last game, a 56-48 loss to Cal State Bakersfield, the team shot only 23 percent from the field, making only three of their 25 three-pointers on the night. Much of the team's early-season struggles can be attributed to its inefficient offense, especially from deep. In its first two games combined, Santa Barbara has made only 14 percent of its three pointers despite chucking up 49 threes. Despite their struggles on the offensive end, the Gauchos have remained competitive on the floor, dropping both games by single digits. In large part, their competitiveness is due to the play of junior center Natalia Bruening and sophomore guard Bri Anugwom, both of whom have stepped up so far to help fill the void left by the graduation of All-Big West forward Drew Edelman. Bruening has dominated on the boards, collecting 13.5 rebounds per game while also chipping in 15.5 points per game out of the post. From the perimeter, Anugwom has been one of the only consistent three-point threats, with a 50 percent clip from behind the arc. UCSB has also impressed with its resilience and effort so far this season. In their game against CSU Bakersfield, the Gauchos found themselves down 32-14 at the half ""î a scoreline that would demoralize even the most well-coached of teams. Still, the team kept fighting, even cutting the lead to two points near the end of the second half. While the results haven't been there yet, this no-quit attitude bodes well for the squad moving forward. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, things won't get any easier when they take on a Trojans team that has feasted on Big West opponents so far this season. In its first game of the year, USC cruised to a 73-55 victory over UC Riverside, before absolutely dismantling Long Beach State by a score of 86-50. Santa Barbara will need to slow down the Trojans' star-studded backcourt if the Gauchos have any hope of pulling off the upset. In particular, USC is led by senior guard Aliyah Mazyck, who averaged 16.5 points per game last year for a Trojan team that went 20-11. Mazyck is once again leading USC in scoring this season, averaging 19 points per game so far this year. Mazyck is accompanied in the backcourt by junior point guard Minyon Moore, who has been sensational so far this season. After making the Pac-12 All Defensive team last season, Moore comes into Thursday's affair averaging 3.5 steals per game, along with 18.5 points and seven assists per game. Moore and Mazyck form one of the most formidable backcourt duos in the country, especially on the defensive end, and handling them will be imperative to the success of Santa Barbara. The Trojans are much weaker in the frontcourt, however, with no player other than Moore averaging more than 5.5 rebounds per game. Much of Santa Barbara's success will come down to how well Bruening can exploit that weakness. If she can dominate on the glass and prevent USC's backcourt from getting easy baskets, the Gauchos should be able to at least keep the game competitive. The game will tip-off on Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center. A version of this story appeared on page 07 of the Nov. 15th print edition of the Daily Nexus.†

sports,Season in Review: Water Polo Ends With Best Record Since 1991,15-Nov-18,5:10 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/season-in-review-water-polo-ends-with-best-record-since-1991/,"Nexus File Photo The No. 5 UCSB men's water polo team finished their season earlier than expected due to the fires that are still impacting Southern California. Santa Barbara was getting ready to face No.8 Pepperdine, but the game was canceled due to the closure of the 101 freeway, which prohibited the Waves from making the trip.

Despite the season ending early due to extremely unfortunate circumstances, it was an overall successful campaign for the 'Chos as they ended the year with an 18-8 record, 3-1 in conference play. After a disappointing season in 2017, they were able to rally and win seven more games than the prior year. 

Many attribute their turnaround to the stellar play from senior driver Boris Jovanovic, as he ended the year with 78 goals and 10 assists. By putting constant pressure on the defense, he was not only able to find the back of the net on many occasions but was also able to set up his teammates due to the attention he received from opposing defenses. Unfortunately, he could not be honored due to the cancelation of the Pepperdine matchup, which was Santa Barbara's last home game. Although Jovanovic was a major contributor, there were other players who had just as much of an impact. Junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic was outstanding and contributed in every major category with 48 goals as well as a team-leading 25 assists, along with 37 steals.  A major characteristic of the Gaucho offense was the unselfish nature of every player. Five players had double-digits assists, which made the team difficult to defend especially when they had the advantage of a power play. 

The selfless nature of the offense also led to 12 players having more than 10 goals on the season. With every player being a threat to net a goal, opponents struggled to hold down UCSB, which led to them averaging over 13 goals per contest.  While Santa Barbara's offense clearly improved, its defense also took major strides, primarily due to the play of freshman goalkeeper Tiago Bonchristiano. Bonchristiano had 149 saves on the year and only gave up an average of nine goals a game in his last five starts.  With 10 freshman on the roster, it was important for Jovanovic and Gvozdanovic to provide leadership. As the season went on, the freshmen started to contribute on a regular basis, whether it be by netting goals or playing stingy defense leading to fastbreak opportunities. 

Freshman driver Nathan Puentes was able to provide a spark for the 'Chos throughout the year as he contributed on both ends of the pool. He finished the season with 16 goals, 5 assists and 8 steals. 

It will be important for Puentes and his fellow freshmen teammates to continue to take strides going into next season. With Santa Barbara losing Jovanovic, it will need its young core to step up, specifically offensively. 

One of the major takeaways from the season was that the Gauchos improved in almost every statistical category, including goals, assists and steals, while also allowing less goals per contest. By being aggressive defensively, they were able to limit the amount of shots on goal in comparison to the 2017 season, and this also gave them more opportunities to put pressure on the opposing team's goalkeeper. 
 With most of the starters returning for the 2019 season, there is a lot of excitement brewing among those in the program with the hope that they could surpass this season's win count of 18.  That being said, UCSB must use this offseason to build upon its pre-existing habits as well as continue to strengthen the chemistry within the team. A version of this story appeared on page 07 of the Nov. 15th print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Women's Volleyball To Close Out Season at Thunderdome,15-Nov-18,5:05 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-15/womens-volleyball-to-close-out-season-at-thunderdome/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The 2018 season has been an up-and-down campaign for the UCSB women's volleyball team. The trick this week for the Gauchos will be to end on a high note. Last week was not exception to the up-and-down trend. UCSB lost to UC Irvine in four sets (17-25, 25-23, 17-25, 14-25) on Thursday night but rebounded two nights later to top UC Davis 3-1 (25-18, 24-26, 25-22, 26-24). The split decision pushed the Gauchos to 15-11 on the season and 7-7 in the Big West. UCSB now must gear up to close its season with two matches in the Thunderdome this week. Both matches come against teams the Gauchos handled earlier in the season: Cal State Fullerton on Friday and UC Riverside on Saturday. UCSB swept Fullerton the first time they met, an unsurprising result considering the Titans sit at the very bottom of the Big West standings. The team is 0-14 against conference opponents and 6-21 overall. It's been a season of losses for the Titans ""î they're on a 20-game losing streak and are the only team in the Big West averaging less than 10 kills per set. They've played the same amount of sets in conference play as juggernaut Cal Poly, but that's because they're only occasionally able to prolong their matches beyond a sweep. Accordingly, the Gauchos handled the Titans in three sets back on Sept. 22. Fullerton got to 20 points in a set just once, in a fairly tight first set, but UCSB was firmly in control the rest of the match. Another win on Friday will require the Guachos to avoid any major mistakes and simply play solid volleyball. So long as star outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins is firing away and the defense is playing well, UCSB should be able to make like the rest of the Big West and beat Fullerton. UC Riverside, at 4-10 in conference play and 9-17 overall, hasn't been too much better than the Titans this season. That said, the Highlanders gave the Gauchos a pretty good fight when the two teams met in Riverside on Sept. 21. The two teams swapped the first two sets, but while Riverside's hitting percentage only dropped as the match went on, UCSB's stayed consistent. The Gauchos hit .256 in the third set and .219 in the fourth to take a four-set victory, their first of the season in Big West play. Now at home, UCSB will be looking to more or less repeat that winning formula. Ruddins was the only player in double-digits for kills back in that first match, and she'll likely need more help if things are going to be easier this time around. The Gauchos have shown occasional improvements in that area since then. Saturday's win over UC Davis was one of those times, as Rowan Ennis's 18 kills and Gigi Ruddins's 14 gave UCSB three significant attacking threats. UC Riverside's statistics are just a hair better than Fullerton's in Big West play, but they still shouldn't be overlooked. The Highlanders are indeed second-worst in kills per set, hitting percentage and blocks per set, but they pulled off an upset win over third-place UC Irvine on Nov. 2. Five Riverside players had double-digit digs in that match and three other players had double-digit kills, including Marissa Holt, the fourth most prodigious attacker in Big West play this season. That wide array of quality performances powered the Highlanders to victory then, and they have the ability to do it again on Saturday night if the Gauchos slip up. Saturday's match will also be Senior Night for UCSB, which could give Santa Barbara a bit of an emotional lift. The Gauchos will be honoring three players: setters Annie Hasselmann and Lexi Rottman and libero Emilia Petrachi. In such an up-and-down season that has seen the team pinball from wins to losses night to night, UCSB would love to finish the season on a three-game winning streak. They'll get that chance this week. The Gauchos close their season with a match against CSU Fullerton on Friday night and a match against UC Riverside on Saturday Night. Both matches will take place at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome. A version of this story appeared on p. 6 of the Nov. 15, 2018, edition of the†Daily Nexus

sports,Gauchos Look to Build Strong Home-Court Advantage,16-Nov-18,5:34 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-16/gauchos-look-to-build-strong-home-court-advantage/,"Nexus File Photo The collegiate regular season continues this weekend, as the UCSB men's basketball team remains at home and prepares to host the visiting Montana State Bobcats. This new season of basketball is off to an exhilarating start, and there's plenty more to be excited about. The Gauchos appear to be in fine form, and they'll aim to match that same intensity this weekend, as they look forward to hosting the Bobcats in this week's second regular-season matchup. UCSB enters this game with a 2-1 overall so far into the season, and they should retain all the momentum, considering their very successful home debut on Tuesday night. More specifically, the Gauchos are coming off a dominant showing as they earned an 88-32 win over Cal Lutheran in their latest exhibition match. In addition, this win also proved historic, as UCSB went on to break two of its own school records ""î first, with an all-time margin of victory at 56, and second, in allowing the least amount of points ever to an opponent at only 32. Dropping 50 points in the first half alone, this commanding performance featured all the Gauchos earning some playing time as the team went on to shoot for an almost 60 percent field goal percentage. One bright spot for the Gauchos has to be the play of junior forward Christian Terell. As one of the few returning players from last season, Terell's energy and experience off the bench will be crucial for the squad moving forward. He went a perfect 4-4 from the field in the Gauchos' last game and will continue to try to be a sparkplug for the second unit. UCSB will look to build off this same exuberant energy and carry over its winning ways against Montana State. When interviewed about the team's overall explosive production that led to those 50 points in the first half, senior forward Ami Lakoju said, ""úIt's amazing; we know we're going to have that help coming off the bench, myself included. Moving forward, we don't have to just rely on our starting five ""¶ I know [Head Coach Pasternack's mind] is at ease and he can see the potential in that regard, so he must be happy about that.""ù On the other side of the court, the Bobcats are currently split at a .500 win percentage as they prepare for their trip to Santa Barbara. Before their trip to SoCal, they'll also be on the road Wednesday night to face off against Colorado State. The Bobcats' latest matchup also resulted in a victory as they bested Presentation College at home by a score of 83-68. Historically speaking, Tuesday's bout was the first time UCSB ever faced Cal Lutheran. However, Saturday will feature a much more familiar opponent in Montana State, as this will be the 12th time that the Gauchos have lined up against the Bobcats. However, the record is very much one-sided, as UCSB leads the all-time series versus Montana State at 10-1. These two teams also faced off just last year, with the result ending in a 91-69 victory for the visiting Gauchos. As for the Bobcats, they'll be the ones visiting this time around, and they'll want to flip the script in this one. Meanwhile, the Gauchos will be hosting and will want to continue this historical dominance over their out-of-state guests. ""úYou know, last year we played Montana State; they're a very talented group and I heard they got some new guys, but we're not worried about that. We're going to keep scouting and prepare for it like it's any other game,""ù Lakoju said when asked about his thoughts on the upcoming match against the Bobcats. ""úWe're going to have to make sure that we produce, and that's all that we have to do.""ù It's an early tip-off this Saturday, November 17 as the UCSB and Montana State match is set to commence at 2 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

sports,Armond Davis Erupts for 22 Points as Gauchos Rout Montana State,18-Nov-18,6:54 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/armond-davis-erupts-for-22-points-as-gauchos-rout-montana-state/,"Jarriesse Blackmon runs past a defender. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The Thunderdome was packed on Saturday afternoon as the UCSB men's basketball team detonated for its second straight 88-point performance, knocking off the Montana State Bobcats with an 88-69 win. Graduate guard Ar'mond Davis had a breakout 22-point performance on 7-14 shooting while sophomore wing JaQuori McLaughlin supported with 19 points and 5 assists while going 7-12 from the field, including 58 percent from deep. ""úWe had some good preparation this week coming into the game,""ù Davis explained after his career-high Division I scoring night. ""úWe came out in the beginning playing really hard defense and that's how we got that lead ""¶ probably my most aggressive game; I'm just trying to get back into my rhythm.""ù Santa Barbara improved its record to three wins and one loss with the triumph over the Bobcats while Montana State fell to 1-4 with the loss. Now solely behind the unbeaten UC Irvine team, the Gauchos sit in an early second place in the Big West conference standings.  UCSB emerged from the gate with a three-pointer from McLaughlin, which fueled a 13-0 lead capped off by a deep dagger by sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey from beyond the arc. Only three minutes in, the 'Chos were grooving as the home crowd roared behind them. The Bobcats were able to cut the lead to 27-17 after a jumper from junior guard Harald Frey, which forced Coach Joe Pasternack into calling a time-out. Shortly after the break, a block by senior forward Keljin Blevins led to a transition three from junior forward Ladan Ricketts to cut the Gaucho lead to seven, which was the closest the Cats could get throughout the contest. ""úThey hit some really tough shots: tough, tough challenged threes. Ricketts, number 11 ""î he was four of six from three, but those were challenged threes,""ù Pasternack remarked on how to handle the opposing scoring runs. ""úWe can't worry about the score, the runs or anything else. We just have to do what we do for 40 minutes.""ù With five minutes to play in the half, SB went on a 9-0 run as its lead elevated to 17 points following buckets from four separate Gauchos. Senior guard Tyler Hall made a push to close out the half strong and minimize the deficit as he drew a foul to convert an and-1 basket with 36 seconds left in the half.  Hall, a unanimous first-team All-Big Sky Conference player last season, scored a team-high 21 points in 32 minutes on 6-16 shooting from the field. His seven free throws in eight attempts were the most for either team in the non-conference matchup. First-year point guard S√©kou Tour√© entered the ball game for the Gauchos' final possession of the half to splash a three from the left wing and put the Gauchos up by 16 with a 48-32 edge heading into the second half. Freshman forward Amadou Sow set the tone immediately following the second-half whistle as the big man posted a four-point swing to put UCSB up by 20. Sow drew contact on a jumper to head to the line for an and-1 opportunity. After a miss from the charity stripe, Sow corralled his own rebound and finished with an emphatic slam. The Prolific Prep product aided with 11 points on 5-7 shooting while adding a game-high 8 rebounds in the process. In his first year of collegiate basketball, Sow has muscled his way into becoming one of the top five most efficient scorers in the Big West, with a 57 percent field goal percentage through four games.  Ricketts was lights-out from three for the Bobcats as he hit back-to-back corner jumpers from downtown to start a 17-3 run from the Cats. He cut the lead to 10 points with a 68-58 score as Montana State attempted to claw its way back into the ball game. The Bobcats hoped to ride their momentum to a mighty comeback, but a quick trey from captain point guard Devearl Ramsey shut the door on a comeback as he followed it up with a coast-to-coast finish to put UCSB back on top by 16 with 5:26 left in the half. ""úTeams go on runs; I just knew we had to regroup and just get stops again. It all comes down to our defense,""ù Ramsey recalled after the Bobcats' stout comeback attempt. ""úWhen you sense a team's making on a run, you have to bump it down and really try to get a basket. I feel like we did that well out of the time-out. Coach drew up a great play, and we executed and scored.""ù Ramsey was the nucleus of the Gaucho charge as he dished out 8 assists and added 13 points, eight of which came in the second half. The sophomore guard put an exclamation mark on the 88-69 win with a magnificent no-look pass to senior forward Ami Lakoju under the hoop for the easy finish as time expired. The strong homestand this past weekend delivered some home court stability for this Gaucho team as it takes to the road for the Vandal Holiday Hoops Showcase in Boise, Idaho, over Thanksgiving weekend.

sports,"Sweeping CSUF and UCR, Gauchos End Regular Season on High Note",18-Nov-18,6:02 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/sweeping-csuf-and-ucr-gauchos-end-regular-season-on-high-note/,"Anige Banks/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's volleyball team ended its season on a three-game winning streak that included a pair of sweeps on back-to-back nights to clinch a winning 9-7 record along with a fourth-place finish in the Big West.  The first win of the back-to-back came on Friday night at home against Cal State Fullerton, and with the victory, UCSB swept the season series with the Titans. The next night the Gauchos celebrated senior night with a sweep of UC Riverside in the final game of the season.  In the victory against Cal State Fullerton, †UCSB succeeded due to its balanced attack lead by the Ruddins sisters, Lindsey and Gigi, who finished with team highs of 15 and 10 kills apiece.  Zoe Fleck and Emilia Petrachi both finished with double-digit kills on the night and Olivia Lovenberg lead both teams with 38 assists. Each of the first two sets were never in doubt, as the Gauchos grabbed early leads in both and never relented as they won by scores of 25-18 and 25-16. The thirds set was the most competitive set of the night as a service error by Lindsey Ruddins brought the Titans to within two points at 18-20.  But the Gauchos proved to be too overwhelming for Fullerton as they went on one final run to close them out by a score of 25-20, taking the third set and sweeping the match.  On Saturday night the UCSB women's volleyball team celebrated senior night along with the fans in attendance as the team's three seniors, Emilia Petrachi, Annie Hasselmann, and Lexi Rottman were honored for their contributions to the program. The Gauchos fed off of the emotions and energy of the crowd as they swept UC Riverside to end their season on a high note. Senior Emilia Petrachi added to her school record for career digs as she finished with 20 on the night, a mark that lead both squads.  Gigi Ruddins tallied 10 kills and Olivia Lovenberg put up her 9th double-double of the season with 42 assists and 11 digs. However, the story of the night was Lindsey Ruddins putting the team on her back and propelling the Gauchos to a victory in the final outing of her Junior year. Ruddins put up 22 kills and 17 digs, both marks being her best on the season in a 3-set match.  The first set in the victory over UCR was closely contested, as Riverside fought back from an early deficit to tie the set at 19-19, this was until a late run sealed the victory 25-22 in favor of the Gauchos.  The second set saw the Highlanders grab an early lead by as much as three points until the Gauchos found their stride and reclaimed the lead midway through and never looked back to clinch †2-0 lead with a 25-21 set win. The third and final set of the night was even closer than the first two, and it stayed competitive the whole way until UCSB held a 24-20 lead, just a point away from securing the win.  It was then that a pair of Gaucho errors and kills by Christina Escamilla of Riverside tied the set at 24-24 and the momentum had shifted. However as she has done all season long, Lindsey Ruddins took matters into her own hands as she got the final two kills necessary to clinch the sweep and win the final set 26-24. The Gauchos will finish the season with an overall record of 17-11, and a conference record of 9-7, †that is unless they are selected to play in NIVC later this month.  This season's end contrasts greatly to last season, where UCSB finished 8-20 overall, 9-7 in conference, and dropped both of their final two games of the season. With only three seniors on the way out and almost all of the main contributors returning for next year, these final three games should foreshadow a bright future for UCSB volleyball under coach Lantagne Welch.

sports,Visiting Gauchos Outmatched by Trojans 82-39,18-Nov-18,5:52 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-18/visiting-gauchos-outmatched-by-trojans-82-39/,"Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Despite a positive start to the road game for the Gauchos, the UCSB Women's Basketball team was blown out by USC on Thursday, 82-39. Heading into the game, the team knew it would take a near-perfect performance to knock off a strong Trojan team that dominated both UC Riverside and Long Beach State in its first two games of the season. In addition, the team knew it would have to perform more efficiently on offense after scoring only 51 points per game in its first two games, shooting merely 23 percent from the floor in their last game against Cal State Bakersfield. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, their offensive woes carried over on Thursday, with the team going 12-50 from the floor, with half of its made field goals from behind the arc (6-22 from three). In part, Santa Barbara's offensive woes can be attributed to the defensive prowess of the Trojans, whose two starting guards""ìsenior Aliyah Mazyckj and junior Minyon Moore""ìboth made the Pac-12 All Defensive team. Mazyckj and Moore helped shut down sophomore guard Bri Anungwom, who paced the Gauchos with eight points but only shot 30 percent from the field. Perhaps most paramount to the Trojans' success was their domination on the interior, completely shutting down junior center Natalia Bruening. In the Gauchos' first two games of the season, Bruening averaged double-digits in both points and rebounds. On Thursday; however, Bruening was completely shut out, recording both 0 points and 0 rebounds while also picking up four fouls.  UCSB hung around for the beginning portion of the game, taking an early lead in the first quarter and only trailing by six points at the end of the quarter. However, things got out of hand in a hurry, with USC scoring 19 unanswered points in the second quarter to take a comfortable 23 point lead into the locker room. After that, the Trojans pulled away, limiting a rattled Santa Barbara team to only 3 points in the third quarter. One of the biggest differences between the two teams on Thursday was shot selection""ì a byproduct of playing an extremely experienced Trojan squad. In total, USC scored 38 of their 82 points in the paint, while the Gauchos scored only 8 of their 39 points from inside. Santa Barbara was also careless with the ball, committing 22 turnovers that in turn led to 28 points for the Trojans. On fast-break opportunities, USC chipped in 20 points while holding UCSB to 0 points in transition. Because of their inability to score easy, high-percentage shots, Santa Barbara was forced to settle for three-pointers""ìrarely a recipe for success in the college game. Due to their elite shot selection, the Trojans were able to dissect a rather stout Santa Barbara defense, making 47.5 percent of their shots from the field. Mizyck led USC with 21 points, while Moore paced the team with 5 assists on the night. While the Trojans only shot 32 percent on deep from the night, they were able to clean up their misses on the offensive end, dominating Santa Barbara 41-26 on the boards. Ultimately, this game should prove to be a good learning tool for a young and inexperienced Gauchos team that is struggling to find its footing so far this season. Unfortunately for UCSB, things don't get any easier when the team returns home to face off against Loyola Marymount at home on Monday""ìan undefeated team that has already knocked off UCLA and the University of Arizona this season. That game, which will tip off Monday at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome, will be another opportunity for this young Gaucho roster to grow and take on elite competition.

The Gauchos come off two consecutive blowout wins against Cal Lutheran and Montana State as Head Coach Joe Pasternack boasts a 3-1 record thus far in his second season. Armond Davis scored a career-high 22 points against the Montana State Bobcats on Saturday and was nominated for Big West player of the week after his breakout performance. Santa Barbara will kick off the Thanksgiving showcase with a matchup against a 2-1 Portland State Vikings squad that rolls into the weekend following a slew of offensive production in the previous two games. Portland State opened its season by getting blown out by AP Poll No. 21 University of Oregon in an 84-57 loss. However, the Vikings earned some home court stability as they returned to Portland for their next two matches. Following a squeaky 71-64 win over UC Riverside, the Vikings routed Willamette as they dropped a hearty 125 points in the runaway victory. Quarterbacked by sophomore guard Holland Woods, a Phoenix, Arizona native, the Vikings attack has outscored opposition with 84.6 points per game while holding opponents to just 69.7 points against per contest. Woods has averaged 14.3 points over three games while chiming in for an average of 4.3 assists and 3.0 steals in each match. Woods is complemented in the frontcourt by senior forward Jamie Orme who's followed close behind the sophomore guard in scoring the season. Orme has delivered 13.7 PPG average along with a team-high 7.0 rebounds per game. Off the bench, look out for junior college transfer guard Michael Nuga who has posted 11.3 points on average while shooting 61.9% from the field. In game two of the two-day Holiday Classic, the Gauchos will take on a feisty University of Idaho squad that has opened up the year with a 1-2 record. The Vandals suffered early losses to UC Irvine and Nicholls State in the first games of the year but bounced back last Sunday with a convincing 87-59 triumph over Bethesda. Although four Vandals have averaged double-digit points through their first three contests, Idaho has struggled with depth as it carries a noticeably young roster with only 3 upperclassmen. The offensive attack is centered around freshman guard Cameron Tyson who has averaged 20 points through three games. Tyson is an efficient shooter who boats a 59.5% from the field, but the first year doesn't share the ball often and is not a threat on the boards. Tyson is complemented in the backcourt by a pair of junior guards in Trevon Allen and Marquell Fraser. The Vandal offense is run through Fraser who distributes a team-high 5.0 assists per game while securing another team-high 8.0 rebounds per contest. The junior has also added 10 points per game on an average of 31.5 minutes. The story of the year for the Gauchos has been their immediate success on the year with four newcomers in a starting role. As preseason All-Big West Conference standout Max Heidegger has been off the floor battling a concussion, the Gauchos have maintained an impressive scoring presence throughout four games. However, the wait may finally be over as Heidegger tweeted ""úalmost back""ù around 10 p.m. on Monday evening which sparked a flurry of hypotheticals for the upcoming back-to-back weekend. Although the star point guard's return might be just around the corner, you can count on the Gauchos offense to strike with a sweeping arsenal in Boise over the weekend. Tip-off for game one of the Vandal Holiday Hoops Showcase is on Black Friday at 4 p.m. as the Gauchos face off against Portland State before they shift their attention to a contest with the Idaho Vandals at 6 p.m. on Saturday evening at CenturyLink Arena in Boise, Idaho.

sports,UCSB Looks to Pick Up First Win at Lady Rebel Round-Up Tournament,22-Nov-18,3:30 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-22/ucsb-looks-to-pick-up-first-win-at-lady-rebel-round-up-tournament/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's basketball team will head to Las Vegas this week where they will take on UNLV in the UNLV tournament, as they look to get their first win on the year. Depending on the result of that matchup, they will play another team that will be determined by the result between the other teams in the tournament. Santa Barbara is coming off a 70-57 loss to Loyola Marymount. Despite going on multiple runs towards the end of the game, they could not make up for their poor play in the first quarter where they fell behind by ten points. There were positives to take away from the game however. Redshirt junior Coco Miller had a breakout game with twenty points and five assists. Junior guard Tal Sahar also stood out as she was four for seven from behind the three point line, finishing the night with 15 points and four rebounds. UCSB will look to build upon their defensive performance as they held Loyola Marymount to under 40% from the field, including 4-18 from three. That being said, they must also limit the amount of fouls they commit as they gave up 38 free throws for the lady rebels. UNLV comes into this game winless as well with their most recent loss coming against Gonzaga University. The lady rebels are led by senior forward Katie Powell who is averaging fifteen points on the year. In order for the ""òChos to be successful in this contest, it will be crucial for them to limit Powell's shots from distance where she is shooting 40% on the year. One of the common struggles that UCSB has faced early on in the season has been their inability to find an identity on the offensive end. While they did improve against Loyola Marymount with respect to shooting the ball more efficiently, their field goal percentage average is still under 35%. A major key towards improving their field goal percentage will be to get junior center Natalia Bruening more involved. Since she is the team's best post player, she can score in the paint as well as get the ball to the team's shooters when the double team comes. Another point of emphasis will be aggressively attacking the basket rather than simply swinging the ball from side to side. This should lead to more fouls called in favor of the ""òChos which will likely bring up their 15.8 free throw line attempts per game even more. Moreover, attacking aggressively will create better looks from distance because the opposing team's defense will be forced to collapse on the player who drives to the basket. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom has been one of the few players who has constantly attacked the basket which is one of the reasons why she is near the top of the team in both free throws attempted (2.2 per game) and assists (1.8 per game). As the team plays more together, the consistency on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor will surely improve. With many new faces in the program this year, it is understandable that it will take time for the chemistry to grow amongst the players. Despite this group currently struggling, they have maintained a level of high energy despite when the game seems to be out of reach, a characteristic that is a welcome sight for head coach Bonnie Henrickson. Looking to end the month of November on a positive note, the Gauchos will try to pick up their first win as they face UNLV at 12 p.m. this Saturday, Nov. 24, in their first game at the UNLV tournament.

sports,Freshman Setter Olivia Lovenburg's Immediate Impact,29-Nov-18,5:05 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/freshman-setter-olivia-lovenburgs-immediate-impact/,"Olivia Lovenburg sets for Zoe Fleck. Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Division 1 volleyball at the NCAA level is no joke, and for incoming freshmen there is often a learning curve that comes with adjusting to a higher level of play.  Some of these newcomers are forced to wait their turn behind more experienced players who have earned their roles over the course of their collegiate career. This allows them to sit back and learn about their new environment so that by the time their name is called, they will be mentally and physically prepared to play.  The path toward contributing to your team's success usually involves some waiting and learning on the part of younger players, but not in the case of UCSB's star freshman setter, Olivia Lovenberg. The San Diego native had earned the starting setter position before the Gauchos opened their season and consequently she was forced to adjust on the fly.  ""úI wasn't really expecting it, but it's been amazing,""ù Lovenberg said. Needless to say, she accepted her role and excelled immediately as she put up four double-doubles with assists and digs in her first six games, and she kept her production consistent throughout the entire season as she led the Big West Conference in assists per set. There are benefits to learning from the sidelines, but there is no substitute for getting game-reps and learning while on the floor. Young players are forced to go through the difficult period of getting used to the college level, and they can ease this transition along if other new players are there alongside them. This year's class of newcomers includes one transfer along with seven freshmen, one of whom was Lovenberg. She claims that she benefited from being a part of a larger freshman class. ""úIt was definitely nice to come in with a bigger class because we have such an intense everyday schedule,""ù Lovenberg said. ""úSo coming in with these girls who are going through the same things as you are was super helpful.""ù A group of young, talented players is a great indicator of future success, but in order to succeed in the present moment, a team needs its veterans to contribute on the floor as well as mentor the underclassmen. The Gauchos have three seniors on the roster this season who all mean a lot to newcomers such as Lovenberg. ""úThe three seniors that we're losing are a super big part of our team, but we're all really close like a family, so I think our chemistry will carry over and we'll be able to come out strong next year.""ù The season as a whole for the Gauchos had its ups and downs, but they managed to put it all together for a stretch run as they won five of their last seven matches, including three straight wins to finish the season in fourth place in the Big West at 9-7. ""úI definitely think it was a huge momentum change,""ù Lovenberg said. ""úThose three games were all consistent, really good team wins that I think really helped us moving forward to next year.""ù UCSB ended its season on a high note, but as this year's highly-touted freshman class gets a year older and a new class of freshmen join next year, the expectations will undoubtedly be higher. Lovenberg is aware of the raised expectations and is willing to embrace them in order to take the next step as a team. ""úI think the expectations are probably going to grow and we're all gonna work harder,""ù Lovenberg said. ""úIt will create a friendly †competitive environment and we're all gonna strive to be the best we can be.""ù With her freshman season in the books, and a Big West All-Freshman team to her name, Olivia Lovenberg is on the fast track to success at the college level. Paired with a young team on the rise, †Lovenberg's talents and mindset should allow for a promising future for Gaucho volleyball.

Although star guard Max Heidegger has yet to play this season due to a concussion, the new Gaucho starters are having no problems holding it down for second-year Head Coach Joe Pasternack. Following a monster Thanksgiving weekend from graduate student and team guard Armond Davis in Boise, Idaho ""î earning him Big West Athlete of the Week ""î UCSB will come home to the Thunderdome and host Sacramento State on Thursday evening. The Hornets are unbeaten through three games this season but have yet to play an away game. Sac State recently pulled out consecutive wins against Big West foes as it held off UC Davis in a tight 58-55 win on Nov. 20. Later in the week, the Hornets knocked out Cal State Fullerton in an 87-82 overtime shootout on Nov. 24. It's been a surprisingly promising start for the Hornets following a feeble 7-25 season just a year ago, but senior guard Marcus Graves has been giving Sacramento new life with his return to the hardwood. Graves leads the Hornets' attack with a mark of 15.0 points per game, with an average of 9.3 rebounds and 9 assists. The senior opened the year with a triple-double against Simpson University as he posted 12 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists enroute to a 76-52 blowout. Although Graves limited himself to a mere two turnovers against Simpson, UC Davis forced him to commit eight turnovers just a week later.  Sophomore forward Ethan Esposito is a solid threat off the bench for the Hornets, as he also posts a 15-points-per-game mark, tied for first on the Sacramento squad. Esposito adds 7.3 rebounds per game and has been much more efficient than Graves when on the floor, as he is currently shooting a 60.9 field goal percentage, compared to Marcus Graves's 31.4 percent during the season. During the latter half of the week, the Gauchos will head up to Seattle, Wash. for a showdown against preseason No. 25 University of Washington. Washington fell out of the top-25 rankings following losses to current national No. 8 Auburn earlier in the year and Minnesota over the Thanksgiving break.  The Huskies head into the Sunday evening matchup sporting a 5-2 record with an attack spearheaded by sophomore guard Jaylen Nowell and senior forward Noah Dickerson. Nowell boasts a 19.8 points-per-game average while shooting 59.5 percent from the field. Leading the front court, Dickerson adds 18.5 points per contest along with 8 rebounds a game. Washington has an array of weaponry, as seen during Tuesday evening's game against Eastern Washington in an 83-59 triumph, with senior guard Dominic Green leading the attack for the Huskies with 25 points on 9-13 shooting from the field.  UW shifts its focus to UCSB over the weekend as the Gauchos look to knock off the best opponent on their schedule. SB is 1-1 on the road this season, but the 'Chos are coming off a four-game winning streak and hoping to ride their Cinderella start to an underdog victory over the favored Huskies. The Gauchos play Sacramento State on Thursday evening with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome in Santa Barbara. Over the weekend, UCSB will hit the road for the matchup of the year against the University of Washington Huskies at 7 p.m. on Sunday night in the Alaska Airlines Arena of Seattle, Wash.

sports,"Proposal For a Smaller, More-Balanced NBA",29-Nov-18,5:15 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/proposal-for-a-smaller-more-balanced-nba/," The National Basketball Association has too many teams. It's time to embrace contraction. The talent pool has become too diluted and there are too many teams that are losing money, forcing the richer teams to prop up their poorer cousins via revenue sharing. There's a simple, albeit practically and politically difficult, solution to both problems: contraction. There are currently 30 teams in the NBA. That's the same as the MLB and two less than the NFL, so it's not a large number in the American sports context. That said, it's still too many. With 30 teams in the league competing for talent, what results is a massive inequality in talent. Simply put, there aren't enough superstars or even just normal stars available for every team to be competitive. As a result, we get teams like the Warriors and the Rockets, with gluts of stars, competing against teams like the Hawks and the Cavaliers, with not a competent NBA starter in sight. Fewer teams would eliminate, or at least reduce, the number of unequal matchups in the NBA. The talent pool would stay the same while the number of teams competing for that talent pool would decrease, leading to talent spreading more evenly throughout the league. It's a simple argument: Fewer teams means a more balanced league. What's not so simple is the question of which teams get contracted. No one is going to volunteer to step up to the chopping block, after all. That's where the revenue issue comes in. According to a 2017 ESPN report, 14 NBA teams lose money. The revenue-sharing system, however, takes some of the profits from the other 16 teams and spreads them out through the league to mitigate this issue. After these payouts, there are nine teams that spend more than they take in through revenue. Those nine teams are the Brooklyn Nets, Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Memphis Grizzlies, Milwaukee Bucks, Orlando Magic, San Antonio Spurs and Washington Wizards. Those teams constitute our chopping block. If an NBA team is unprofitable even after it gets money from the rest of the league, it's not a sustainable operation. We can trim that list down for regional reasons and arrive at a final list of six teams destined for contraction: the Nets, Hawks, Cavaliers, Bucks, Magic and Spurs. One of the first things that jumps out about that list is how Eastern Conference-heavy it is. After contraction, we're left with 10 teams in the East and 14 in the West. There's an easy fix: Move the New Orleans Pelicans and the Memphis Grizzlies to the East and we're back at an even split of 12 each. This won't be easy or uncontroversial by any means. There are, after all, plenty of Spurs, Bucks and maybe even Magic fans that won't simply accept the disappearance of their favorite team. But for each team on that list, there's a nearby alternative option. I'm not saying that glibly; I know that no Spurs fan is going to jump right to the Rockets or the Mavericks. After a few years, though, when passions have faded, we'll see how things lie. Even if those fans don't return, well, they weren't exactly keeping their teams profitable in the first place. Some people might object to using profitability as the arbiter of life and death in the future NBA. In all honesty, I'm not entirely comfortable in using such a soulless, capitalist benchmark. The issue is that there aren't any better options for solving these pressing issues. We can't simply contract teams that are and have been bad. Talent fluctuates a lot more than revenue. Put in another way, players come and go but markets are much more stable. Anyway, contracting along those lines would take out my Sacramento Kings, and I can't have that. It's possible that there's a better method of contraction. If there is, I'm open to hearing it. The fact is, however, that the NBA needs contraction. The superteam era has spawned an entire sub-industry of NBA takes on how to create a measure of parity in the league. What I'm arguing is that the way to combat superteams is to lean into them. There's no such thing as a superteam when every team is a superteam. Not only would my contraction system combat superteam-ism, it would also be profitable for the league. By eliminating the teams that are losing money, the NBA would be able to reduce its revenue-sharing system, keeping more money in the pockets of the remaining teams. Reducing the number of teams to 24 will improve the quality of play and reduce the number of teams losing money, all while making sure that every fan in every part of the country has a regional team to root for. The NBA doesn't want to contract, but it needs to do it anyway.

sports,"Reuben Foster Signed, NFL Remains Complicit to Domestic Violence",29-Nov-18,5:00 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-11-29/reuben-foster-signed-nfl-remains-complicit-to-domestic-violence/,"Courtesy of The Wrap No matter how low of a threshold I hold the NFL to, the league always finds a way to let me down. Less than 24 hours after being arrested for domestic violence for the second time in the year ""î and subsequently being cut by the 49ers ""î second-year linebacker Reuben Foster was claimed immediately on waivers by the Washington Redskins. I know, I shouldn't be surprised. NFL owners display an incorrigible lack of social awareness, and Redskins owner Dan Snyder is one of the worst offenders. Still, I can't help but be disgusted. Truth be told, Foster should have been cut long ago by the 49ers. Already drafted with off-the-field issues, Foster was arrested in February for domestic violence and has reportedly had a police report filed against him last month. How many chances does one player get? Once again, the NFL displays their indifference toward violence against women. At his press conference this week, 49ers' GM John Lynch said that releasing Foster ""údoesn't mean we don't love him.""ù In that conference, Lynch failed to mention the victim a single time. One would think the NFL would have learned from the Ray Rice situation, when in 2014 Rice was caught on video beating up his fianc√© in an elevator. Somehow, Rice was only suspended for two games (for reference, smoking marijuana results in a four game suspension). I remember writing an opinion piece in my high school newspaper about that incident, expressing both disappointment and dismay at Roger Goodell's decision. This time, it is Dan Snyder who is purposely turning a blind eye toward violence against women. In today's more socially aware society, with the #MeToo movement thriving, watching the NFL once again disregard domestic violence offences is beyond disheartening ""î it is unfathomable. As of now, Reuben Foster has been placed on the commissioner's exempt list, meaning he is ineligible to play. Still, by signing Foster, the NFL makes him eligible to be present at the Redskins facility on a ""úreasonable basis.""ù Anyone who believes being back in an NFL facility is the best way for Foster to reform is incredibly naive. Senior VP for the Redskins Doug Williams stated that the decision was made after talking to a number of his former Alabama teammates, who defended the character of Foster. Sure, Foster has been arrested three times this year, but at least his college teammates said he was a real stand-up guy! The NFL does not care about women or domestic violence; they do not care about anything except lining their own pockets. Children look up to these athletes ""î so what kind of a message does it send when a player can get arrested twice in one year and still be signed immediately? More importantly, what kind of a message does it send to boys about how they should treat women? †At best, the NFL is apathetic toward violence against women; at worst, they are condoning the actions of these players, valuing wins over any sort of moral obligation. It is also impossible to look at this decision without wondering how Colin Kaepernick remains unsigned. How is it possible that a player who has been arrested twice in one year can get signed in a day, but Kaep remains unsigned? How is it possible that the Redskins last week signed Mark Sanchez ""î a mediocre quarterback best known for the infamous butt fumble who has only gotten worse with age ""î without even giving Kaepernick a workout? The message here is simple: African-American men can do anything they want, including being arrested for multiple felonies, as long as they don't advocate for social change. To NFL owners, nonviolent protest is seen as a greater concern and threat to society than domestic violence. Everybody knows the NFL is never going to be a progressive league. After all, Snyder's team is literally named the ""úRedskins,""ù a name Snyder laughably believes honors Native Americans. But it is becoming increasingly impossible for me to support ""î let alone watch ""î a league that refuses to take a stand against domestic violence.

On Sunday, the Gauchos were informed that they captured a spot in the National Invitational Volleyball Championship (NIVC), †a tournament that boasts of 32 competing teams. ""úIt was great to be invited; it just means all of our hard work had paid off. Now we are striving for more and continuing to get better as a program,""ù junior outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins said. Santa Barbara clinched a tournament berth following a successful regular season that saw them finish with a 17-11 overall record and a 9-7 record in Big West play. UCSB's 9-7 league record, which helped them earn a fourth-place finish, is also its best finish since 2013. In the first round, the Gauchos will face off against Fresno State, who comes into the tournament boasting a 21-10 overall mark and who also finished second in the Mountain West following a 13-5 league record. If UCSB hopes to continue its season beyond its first-round match, which will be played on Thursday, then it will need to rely on its star outside hitter, Ruddins. The junior is one of the best players in the entire country let alone the conference. She averages 5.37 kills per set, which is the best mark of any Big West player, and also averaged 0.38 service aces per set, the third best mark in league play. Additionally, Ruddins was one of two Gauchos named First Team All-Big West. ""úI am confident in my own skill set, and the rest of the team has been working just as hard,""ù Ruddins said. ""úI think we will be ready for this moment come Thursday.""ù The other first team letter winner is senior defensive specialist Emilia Petrachi. Petrachi was the league's best in digs per set, averaging 5.02. Another key contributor for UCSB this season was freshman setter Olivia Lovenberg, who did a great job of positioning teammates all year, leading to her Big West best mark of 11.19 †assists per set. While big for UCSB, this match is also just as big for Fresno State, who will be seeking its first postseason win since 1995. Coincidentally, the last time Fresno State was in the postseason was in 2002, when it also faced off against Santa Barbara. That match did not go so well for the Bulldogs, who lost 3-1. This time around, if Fresno State wants a win, then it will need to make sure to stop Ruddins. One player capable of doing that is sophomore Reagan Leonard, whose 570 digs this year is the second most in a season in program history. Her current 4.75 digs-per-set average is second best in the Mountain West. On offense, senior Taylor Slover led the team and ranked third in her conference with 3.94 kills per set. History definitely favors the Gauchos in this matchup as they have won 25 of the 33 total meetings, but Thursday will be a different match. If UCSB could knock off Fresno State on Thursday, then it will face off against the winner of UNLV/UC Irvine. Santa Barbara did not play UNLV this season but lost its two matches against conference foe UCI this year. Overall, this season has been a success for UCSB. It has improved drastically from last season, when it only won eight games, and overall it has played great team volleyball. It is an accomplishment just being at the NIVC tournament, but the Gauchos will be hoping for more. ""úIt's great that we have more volleyball, and we are all happy to be here in a position we have never been, but now we have to go out there and play well,""ù Ruddins said. UCSB will take on Fresno State at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 29, at the Cox Pavilion Center. With a win, Santa Barbara will advance to the second round, during which it will play either UNLV or UCI at 7 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 30, at the same location.

sports,Gauchos Pick Up Second Win of the Season Against Grand Canyon,4-Dec-18,2:53 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-04/gauchos-pick-up-second-win-of-the-season-against-grand-canyon/,"Danae Miller fakes out her defender. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus In what would be their second win of the season, the UCSB women's basketball team beat Grand Canyon by 11 points and now have an overall record of 2-6.  Santa Barbara was able to hold Grand Canyon to 38 percent from the field and forced 10 turnovers which made it difficult for the Lopes to find any rhythm offensively. 

It was a quick start for UCSB as they ended the first quarter with a six-point lead. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom provided stability on offense as she had six of her 19 points in just the first quarter. Redshirt Junior Guard Coco Miller also added two three's to prevent the Grand Canyon defense from doubling Anugwom. Heading into this game, the Gauchos were still trying to find an identity offensively as they have struggled to score consistently. In the second quarter, the squad was able to drop 28 points through an emphasis of balanced scoring. Junior center Natalia Bruening scored the first six points in the quarter as she established herself in the post early.  After her hot start, five different ""òChos got into the scoring action which made it difficult for the Grand Canyon defense to key in on one player. As the second quarter wrapped up, UCSB was able to outscore the Lopes by 13 points, giving them a 19-point lead heading into halftime.  They would cool off offensively in the third, however, as they were only able to score 10 points in the period. Grand Canyon made it a point of emphasis to pressure the ball more to start the second half which led to easy baskets on the other end. 
 One of the common trends throughout the early season is that the squad has been unable to respond when something does not go their way in the game. Despite the increased pressure, Santa Barbara continued to remain aggressive and was undeterred when they faced adversity for the first time in the game. 
 Grand Canyon was able to find its rhythm however, particularly in the fourth quarter as the team scored 22 points and cut their deficit to just 11 points by the end of the game. They were led by senior center Sharon Miller who had 12 points on the night, while also going 8-for-8 from the free throw line. 
 Bruening did a terrific job for the Gauchos as she was able to limit the post touches for Miller which prevented her from making more of an impact offensively. With her confidence growing every game, she will surely be one of the team's best players by the end of the season.  Miller has also been fantastic in the past few games as she has not only been making an impact offensively with her jumpshot but also has provided veteran leadership for the young group.  As the season has gone on, UCSB has started to play with more chemistry which has led to more fluidity on both ends of the floor. Statistically, they have been able to improve their field goal percentage as a result of an increase in communication on the floor.  For Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson, it is very encouraging to see the team continue to fight and remain locked in despite their disappointing start to the season. As they face more talented opponents in their upcoming games, they will look to rely on the habits that they are building now to help compete in those contests.  The Gauchos are back in action next Saturday at 2 p.m. as they head to Pacific looking to go on their first win streak of the year.

Cameryn Brock/Daily Nexus In the game of the year, the UCSB men's basketball team was held off by a stout Washington Huskies defense as the Gauchos dropped their second loss of the season in a 67-63 defeat that had fans on the edge of their seat until the final whistle blew.  Graduate guard Armond Davis led a hearty Gaucho comeback that fell just short as he added 20 points on 8-19 shooting including going 3-9 from downtown. Davis notched his first career double-double while adding 10 rebounds in the process as the UCSB final push came up just four points short. The Gauchos will drop to 6-2 on the season with the loss, but held their heads high after a graceful loss to a tough Pac-12 foe. University of Washington will move to 6-2 as well this year following a choppy, yet effective, Huskies triumph. Noah Dickerson posted 22 points while shooting 6-8 from the field. Dickerson, a senior forward, added 10-13 from the free-throw line plus eight rebounds to propel Washington to the win. Jaylen Nowell followed close behind with 17 points going 6-11 on field goals while adding five assists and four rebounds in the process.  The Huskies got off to a commanding start with a 10-0 run to open up the ball game. UCSB looked bewildered and outmatched within the first three minutes as Matisse Thybulle capped off the dominant start with a transition flush to take an early double-digit lead. Thybulle was premier as a defensive stopper for the Huskies. The 6-foot-5 senior picked off six steals for Washington which paved the way for 18 points in transition for UW. Thybulle, a Washington native, added 13 points on 5-10 from the field including going 3-6 from the perimeter.  Armond Davis finally put the Gauchos on the board with a powerful drive in the lane as he drew contact and finished the take with a trip to the line for a 3-point-play. SB rode a 14-7 scoring run as Davis inched the Gauchos within striking distance with a transition lay in to make it 17-14 with 6:06 to play in the half.  Sophomore guard Jaylen Nowell answered back with a floater from the left inside hash-mark to extend the lead up to five points, but on the ensuing possession, sophomore guard Jaquori Mclaughlin found captain point guard Devearl Ramsey for a laser three-pointer that cut the Huskies' lead to 19-17 with 4:30 left in the first half.  The Huskies found themselves up five at the break with a 26-21 lead over the underdog Gauchos as Noah Dickerson powered through the UCSB front court with 10 points on 4-5 shooting. Devearl Ramsey quarterbacked the Gaucho attack with eight points in the first half to go along with five points and six rebounds from Armond Davis. Freshman standout Amadou Sow opened up the second half with a quick bucket to close out the Husky lead once again, but Washington abruptly went on an 8-2 run to open up a nine-point lead once again.  The Gauchos minimized the 34-25 deficit with a clutch three from freshman Jay Nagle, the second most efficient three-point shooter in the Big West Conference while shooting 50 percent from deep this year.  With 13:41 to play in the second half, Devearl Ramsey knocked down a sharp three to close out the deficit to 36-33. Nagle was not done yet as he followed up Ramsey's three with a dagger three of his own to tie the game up at 36 points apiece.  Nagle tied his career-high mark with nine points while shooting 2-4 from three-point range as seven of his nine came in the second half. The freshman delivered a premier 29 minutes for UCSB off the bench including a stout defensive performance as well.  SB took its first lead of the game at 11:47 to go up 37-36, but almost immediately themselves down 45-38 following a 9-1 Husky scoring stretch. For the second time in five minutes, UCSB battled back with a 7-0 run capped off by a three-pointer from Jaquori Mclaughlin to tie it back up at 45-45.  Matisse Thybulle led the defensive core for UW throughout the game but fouled out at the four-minute mark shaping up a potential comeback for the Gauchos. Without Thybulle on the court, UCSB looked controlled and confident in the final four-minute frame. Armond Davis drove the paint and finished to cut the lead to three. Amadou Sow quickly intercepted a pass from Hameir Wright and found a streaking Davis in transition for a fast break three to tie the game up at 57-57. Davis single-handedly kept UCSB in the game during the second half as he added 15 points in the final 20 minutes on 6-11 from the field.  The Gauchos ultimately fell to Washington by a score of 67-63 following a cluster of fouls and free-throws to end the game as the Huskies held off a prideful UCSB squad. Santa Barbara heads home for its next matchup against Arkansas Pine-Bluff on Dec. 8 at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

sports,"Akron Hopes for Second Cinderella Finish in ""òSoccer Heaven'",7-Dec-18,1:49 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/akron-hopes-for-second-cinderella-finish-at-soccer-heaven-stadium/,"Courtesy of Akron Athletics The last time Akron was in Santa Barbara for a College Cup ""î technically the only time Santa Barbara hosted a College Cup ""î it was a Cinderella moment for the Zips, who won their first title in program history by upsetting top-ranked Louisville, 1-0. This year, Akron will hope to repeat its good fortune in more ways than one. Fourteen games into the season, the Zips sat at 6-6-2 with hardly any hopes of making it to the NCAA Tournament. ""úWe had ups and downs this season. We beat good teams, but we also had tough losses and we knew we had to turn it around,""ù senior goalkeeper Ben Lundt said. And turn it around they did, for the Zips reeled off four straight wins including a victory over then-No. 12 West Virginia. The four wins were just enough for Akron to nab one of the 48 spots in the NCAA Tournament. After a play-in win against Rider University, Akron faced Syracuse, a team that defeated them earlier in the year, 3-1. Akron flipped the script, though, and won at top-seeded Wake Forest and ninth-ranked Stanford to launch them into the Final Four. That is the beauty of sports: One week the season feels over and yet, if the right changes are made, the next week you could be right back in the thick of things. ""úGoing into the season, we had expectations of being here, but how the season went, around midseason it didn't look like we would make the tournament, let alone make a run,""ù Head Coach Jared Embick said. ""úBut we always knew we could get right back into it, and we did.""ù It also only feels fitting that Akron returns to the place it has won its only title ""î Santa Barbara ""î something coach Embick doesn't take for granted. ""úEveryone gets excited to make it to the last week of the season, and it's great to be in a sunny, wonderful place like Santa Barbara,""ù Embick said. The last time Akron was in Santa Barbara for the College Cup, the SB fans really seemed to gravitate toward the Zips. In fact, in 2010 when Akron scored its only goal to defeat Louisville, many fans threw tortillas onto the field, a celebration usually meant only for UCSB. ""úUs mid-majors have to stick together,""ù Emrick said while laughing. ""úIn all seriousness, it was a great memory and hopefully we can draw from that experience and pump our guys up. We are hoping some of the same people and a few others do the same thing this year.""ù In general, Akron also enjoys a lot of success in Santa Barbara. Last year, the Zips defeated the Gauchos 3-1 in a game that saw Akron then-forward Sam Gainford score two goals. ""úWe consider this place our home away from home. Our guys have had success on this turf, and we are really excited to keep that up,""ù Embick said. ""úWe always approach this place with good memories, and hopefully we use that to our advantage this weekend.""ù There is no doubt Akron's confidence is at an all-time high, and honestly, why shouldn't it be?† The Zips have won eight straight matches, they have knocked off some of the best teams in the country to get to the Final Four and they are returning to a place in which they have had much success. It might be easy to get carried away and think Akron is destined to win, but coach Embick is not so quick to say so. ""úAs a coach you always temper excitement, but given everything we have done this season we have proven we are capable of getting it done,""ù Embick said. ""úSome people tossed us aside earlier this year, and we have proven we deserve to be here, but now we have to get it done.""ù Akron first needs to reach its fourth final in program history by defeating Michigan State, a team that is making its own history by being in its first College Cup in 50 years. The Zips defeated the Spartans earlier this year, 2-1. Also, if you didn't believe in coincidences enough, Akron knocked off the other Michigan team, the Wolverines, in 2010 before winning their first title. That same year, they also beat Michigan in the regular season, 7-1. ""úI have already told our guys about how we beat a team from Michigan first last time we were here and how funny everything seems to be playing out,""ù Embick said. ""úHopefully that is a good omen, and hopefully we get it done.""ù A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,"As Showcase Comes Home, Gauchos Left Wondering What Could Have Been",7-Dec-18,2:38 AM,['Arthur Wilkie'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/as-showcase-comes-home-gauchos-left-wondering-what-could-have-been/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus On Halloween night at an hour far past most young trick-or-treaters' bedtimes, a dejected Tim Vom Steeg, in his twentieth year as head coach of the UCSB men's soccer program, set down his keys on the table in the College Cup room situated under the east end of a now-empty Harder Stadium. He faced the local media to discuss all that went wrong in their Big West Tournament quarterfinal versus Cal State Fullerton, which saw the visiting Titans advance to the semifinal after a penalty kick shootout. These season-ending press conferences have become par for the course for Vom Steeg and the Gauchos over the past three years as they've fallen short of reaching the NCAA Tournament in either the quarterfinal or semifinal stages of the Big West Conference Tournament. For a program that was once considered a perennial lock for the NCAA Tournament and a contender for the title, a postseason drought of this length is rare. In the three years since UCSB's last appearance in the NCAA Tournament when they fell to Clemson in the Round of 16, each season's Gaucho team has seen their campaign end in disappointment come conference tournament time. This year's Gauchos became the latest to join that group. As unsuccessful as the Gauchos have been in recent times, there's a recipe for success to make it back to the grand stage of the College Cup. It's simple on the surface, but it wouldn't be the crown jewel of college soccer if it didn't require perfect execution by the four teams that make it that far. Tactics: Outsmarting the Opponent ""úThat's been our issue all year. What's been that ""òsomething different' that can get us a goal?""ù vom Steeg has the expertise and know-how to have the upper hand against any opponent, but as good a problem as it is to have so much talent at his disposal, it was also a nightmare to figure out what formation would get the most out of his team. Throughout, he worked with four different formations: first a 4-2-3-1, then a 3-5-2, onto a 4-4-2, and toward the end of the season shades of a 4-3-3. An argument can be made that UCSB played the best soccer of its season in any of the formations, but once the team got slightly exposed in one setup it was on to the next one. This constant tinkering hampered players who excelled in certain roles in one formation and struggled in others, and there was no regularity for the team to grow into a formation as a unit. One such example is senior defender and team captain Jan Ilskens. If he could be listed as a utility man, that would be a better descriptor since he's been deployed as a center back, defensive midfielder, right back and even as a striker in the past two years. After starting the season as a right back in the 4-2-3-1, he moved to right center back in the 3-5-2. With the wingback spots occupied in the 4-4-2 by juniors Ignacio Tellechea and Noah Billingsley, he began to get some playing time up top to support sophomore Rodney Michael in the forward lines. Playing out of position in attack didn't suit him, so he moved back into the defensive midfield in the 4-3-3. Consistency: Establishing Your Roles ""úIf you follow Gaucho soccer, scoring goals this year has always been an issue for us. When we scored goals, it usually happened in bunches.""ù The 2018 Gauchos certainly did score in bunches: Five times this year they managed to score multiple goals within a five-minute span. In the game against CSUN, it was vom Steeg's tactical switch at halftime that worked to their favor as they scored a trio of goals in just seven minutes. Yet it was hard to spread the goals around the team and even harder to score on the road. The Gauchos had just five players with multiple goals on the season. Of those five, freshman forward Carter Clemmensen's goals were both in the opening weekend of play, and sophomore forward Kaya Fabbretti didn't join the ranks until the final game of the regular season. UCSB's road woes were well-documented this season, but one statistic still seems unbelievable until it's checked against the team's results: the Gauchos failed to score in each of their six road losses. When the Gauchos scored, they got results. When they didn't, they lost. It should be no surprise that Michael had a goal and two assists in the road win at New Mexico and draw at UC Irvine. This year's team relied heavily on the sophomore and oftentimes struggled to find a Plan B. This was the result of an ever-shifting midfield and attack for the Gauchos. The backline became solidified very early on in the season, but each game saw a rotating cast providing support for Michael and Billingsley, seemingly the only two regulars in the attacking half of the starting lineup. UCSB played best when midfielders like junior Sahid Conteh and Fabbretti made deep runs and were able to contribute to the attack. When there's so much talent and so many different styles of play vying for such few spots on the field, it can be difficult to implement one method of play over another. Injuries and suspensions didn't help vom Steeg's case either. Figuring out the perfect combination in both areas will be the biggest challenge for the Gaucho coaching staff heading into next season. Luck: What Every Champion Needs ""úSoccer is a sport that if you don't feel like you're going to score, then you don't let the other team score, and then you leave it to the penalty spot and see what happens.""ù Part of the reason why UCSB hasn't been able to make it back to the NCAA Tournament is simply down to luck. In any tournament setting, especially one with as small a sample size as three games like in the Big West Tournament, a deflection or a shot that hits the post or crossbar can be the difference between winning and losing. In this year's quarterfinal against Fullerton, UCSB dominated possession in the second half of the game, but sophomore midfielder Carson Vom Steeg missed an open shot, and Michael failed to convert on an opportunity late in extra time. Lady (Bad) Luck struck again in the penalty shootout when junior forward Ignacio Tellechea hit the crossbar, ironically after scoring his first goal of the season earlier in the match to get them that far. Luck isn't just a big factor in the conference tournament; the landscape in the Big West would have looked completely different if Michael hadn't missed his penalty in the ninth minute at UC Irvine and the Gauchos didn't have to come from behind to secure the 2-2 draw. If anything, it's as important considering the college soccer season features so many games in such a small window. With so many players being introduced into the fold, it may have been far-fetched to think that everything would come together in just one year. Yet the hope remains. If Tim Vom Steeg gets all of this right and the Gauchos can get some luck on their side, the next trip to the College Cup might not be far off.

sports,"Bright Road Ahead as College Cup Returns to ""úSoccer Heaven""ù",7-Dec-18,1:59 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/bright-road-ahead-as-college-cup-returns-to-soccer-heaven/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus This week, thousands of fans will pour into Harder Stadium to watch a new NCAA men's soccer champion be crowned. Akron, Michigan State, Indiana, and Maryland will all fly cross country, hoping that this will be their year. But how did Santa Barbara ""î a school more renowned for its academic prowess than its athletic department ""î earn the chance to host the most important collegiate soccer game of the year? In large part, UCSB men's soccer Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg deserves credit for how far the Gauchos have come. Since his hiring in 1999, the Gauchos have made the postseason 14 times. In 2004, Santa Barbara shocked the nation by making the College Cup final, ultimately falling to Indiana in the final. In 2006, current LA Galaxy midfielder Chris Pontius and the Gauchos raised the trophy for the first time in program history after knocking off UCLA in the final. In 2010, just before Santa Barbara hosted the college cup for the first time, ESPN.com writer Scott French described Harder Stadium as ""úSoccer Heaven.""ù At the time, the Gauchos easily led the NCAA in attendance, averaging more than 6,000 people per game. When UCSB took on UCLA in 2010 at Harder Stadium, the game drew nearly 16,000 people ""î shattering the old NCAA record by almost 6,000 people. Even this year, in what was at times a trying season for the Gauchos, the team drew nearly 8,000 people for the rivalry game against Cal Poly. Another big reason for the ""úSoccer Heaven""ù nickname stems from Santa Barbara's location. With Harder Stadium less than a mile from the beach and almost always in ideal weather, it's not much of a surprise that teams and their fans love coming to the West Coast for the College Cup. Hosting the College Cup further reinforces what students at UC Santa Barbara already know: soccer is an ingrained tradition at UCSB. For the second time in the last eight years, Santa Barbara will be the center of the college soccer world for an entire weekend. When UCSB hosted the final in 2010, nearly 10,000 fans came out to watch Akron defeat Louisville for its first-ever title. After the game, Akron Head Coach Caleb Porter ""î who would go on to coach the Portland Timbers ""î praised the energy that the crowd brought to the game. With Santa Barbara hosting both the 2018 and 2020 College Cups, there has been some talk of Santa Barbara becoming the permanent host for this event. While that likely won't happen, it proves that the NCAA recognizes the legitimacy of UCSB as a soccer program. Unfortunately, the UCSB men's soccer team will not be competing for the title this year. Despite going undefeated at home during the regular season, the Gauchos were upset in the first round of the Big West tournament by Cal State Fullerton. Still, there is reason for optimism for the future. By hosting the College Cup, which will be televised on ESPNU, UCSB will become more of a household name when it comes to soccer. Ideally, this will help Vom Steeg bring in highly-touted recruits and replenish the talent pool of the squad. A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Collaboration With the Competition: Student Journalists Weigh in on College Cup Teams,7-Dec-18,2:40 AM,['Sports Editor'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/collaboration-with-the-competition-student-journalists-weigh-in-on-college-cup-teams/,"Matt Begala / Indiana Daily Student Hoosiers Back in the Final Four, Seek Redemption for Last Year's Loss
Dylan Wallace, Indiana Daily Student Redemption. That's been the underlying theme of this season for Indiana men's soccer. Sure, Head Coach Todd Yeagley and his team would say all season long how the focus is just on the next game, and as much as that's true, we know what this season meant. Just about one year ago, the Hoosiers were seven minutes and 57 seconds away from going into penalty kicks with Stanford in the National Championship. But when IU forward Griffin Dorsey chose to try and dribble out of the box instead of clearing the ball away, a Stanford attacker stole it and shot it just over the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Trey Muse. Before they knew it, the season was over. It was a season that saw IU finish 18-1-6 and put together the fourth-longest shutout streak in NCAA history at 966:28 minutes. Just two key players left that team, and now 10 of IU's 11 starters return in hopes of avenging that cold Sunday in Philadelphia on Dec. 10, 2017. From offense to defense this Hoosier team is filled with talent and built for success. There is no weak link on this team. Starting in the net, the sophomore goalkeeper has 30 shutouts in his two seasons at IU. Just last week, Muse made an incredible diving save to prevent Notre Dame from taking the lead 1-0 in the quarterfinals. Then there are IU's two rocks in the backline in redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and freshman Jack Maher, who rarely let anyone sneak by them. The two outside backs are seniors Rece Buckmaster and Andrew Gutman. Both are quick and versatile in becoming offensively minded when the time is right. Gutman leads the team in goals with 11. Mix that in with the controlling midfielders that are redshirt senior Francesco Moore, senior Jeremiah Gutjahr, redshirt senior Trevor Swartz, redshirt sophomore Spencer Glass and redshirt senior Cory Thomas, who can all shift back when Buckmaster or Gutman push up, and you get a team that controls possession and allows very few chances. Then there's the forwards ""î Dorsey, sophomore Justin Rennicks, senior Austin Panchot and redshirt sophomore A.J. Palazzolo. Panchot scored the game-winning goal against Notre Dame last week off a header from Gutman's cross. Palazzolo is a big body that is dangerous on set pieces while Rennicks and Dorsey have the speed and talent to take any defender one-on-one. The makeup of this team is dangerous, and that's why the Hoosiers are 20-2-1 this season. The last time the team lost was Oct. 3 against Kentucky, which was an uncharacteristic 3-0 defeat. In the 63 days since then, which has included 12 games, IU has only given up three goals. Also, since that loss, IU has scored 22 goals and been crowned Big Ten Champions ""î becoming the only team in conference history to go an undefeated 8-0 ""î and Big Ten Tournament Champions. Everything is coming together right now for the Hoosiers, and they are playing their best soccer. ""úWe're locked in as much as we've ever been,""ù Yeagley said on Tuesday before the team left for Santa Barbara, Calif. ""úThat's what you want: You want the team to find another gear in every phase of their game. I think we're in that mode right now where everyone is locked in.""ù The redemption of this season wasn't supposed to be beating Stanford. No, the redemption was to claim what the Hoosiers believe is rightfully theirs: the National Championship. Four teams and two games stand in IU's way of accomplishing that goal. Akron, Michigan State, and Maryland are all deserving of spots in the College Cup, but there's only one team who is so driven, so talented and so deserving of winning on Dec. 9, and that team hails from Bloomington, Indiana. Now more than ever, redemption is within grasp of claiming the program's ninth National Championship. Forward Vinicius Lansade celebrates after scoring his first career goal during Maryland's 3-2 overtime win over Penn State at Ludwig Field on Oct. 23, 2018. (Richard Moglen/The Diamondback) Terps Look To Finish The Season Strong With A Title
Joe Catapano, The Diamondback Throw out the standings, the seedings, and the statistics. Forget that Maryland didn't score for the first 476 minutes of the year, didn't win until its fifth match and didn't have a record that would even qualify for the NCAA tournament 12 games into the regular season. No. 11 seed Maryland's campaign can be summarized using the clich√© adage: ""úIt's not how you start. It's how you finish.""ù And the Terps show no signs of ceasing their magical postseason ""î one that's featured two road upsets without conceding a goal in the tournament. Head Coach Sasho Cirovski's Terps are just as capable of winning the national championship as any of the other College Cup participants. Despite a semifinals matchup against a team they haven't beaten both times they've tried this year, the Terps' season took a dramatic turn with a loss on Oct. 12 to Indiana. Maryland is 7-1-1 since falling to the Hoosiers with 18 seconds remaining in Bloomington. The impressive record is thanks to Andrew Gutman, who Cirovski continuously boasts is the best player in college soccer. Even after two convincing 2-0 performances over former ACC foes in NC State and No. 6 Duke, it was hard to see Maryland upsetting No. 3 Kentucky in the quarterfinals. The Wildcats hadn't trailed, lost or been shut out at home all season. Maryland scored in the 29th minute and then held on for another 61 to accomplish all three feats. So now's the time to refer back to my opening sentence: Through all the adversity this season, the Terps' confidence has never wavered. They're not surprised they're playing in Santa Barbara, and understandably so. They knew going into the season that the offense would take time to develop after losing three of their top four goalscorers from 2017. Maryland has now scored in 10 straight games and has scored on its first shot on goal in all three tournament games. They knew they would become tougher playing through what's now the No. 1 toughest schedule in the nation. Maryland only had two ranked wins in the regular season, but they now have three since the Big Ten tournament began. They knew they had a senior class that lost in the NCAA quarterfinals as freshmen, only to see first-round exits in the next two years. Maryland has now redeemed itself, but those seniors didn't come to College Park to reach a College Cup ""î they came to win one. The means of doing so starts with the backline. It's rare for a Maryland team, but its foundation is defense. Junior defenders Donovan Pines and Johannes Bergmann are an elite center back duo, complemented by outside backs senior Chase Gasper and sophomore Ben Di Rosa. If that stout four-man unit breaks down, goalkeeper redshirt junio Dayne St. Claire will make every save he's supposed to and most ones he shouldn't be expected to. The Terps switched to a two-center defensive midfielder formation midway through the year, which essentially adds senior Andrew Samuels and junior Eli Crognale as reinforcements to an already-impenetrable defense. Senior Amar Sejdic pushed forward as a center attacking midfielder, where he's thrived for a team-leading seven goals this season. The three forwards up top have done enough to keep winning. Freshman William James Herve has the dribbling skills, junior Paul Bin has the speed and senior Sebastian Elney has the clutch gene. Let this serve as the final warning. Cirovski has called this season a redemption story, and with two previous heartbreaks against Indiana this year, the Hoosiers might be the penultimate victim in the Terps' title tale. Annie Barker / The State News After five seasons of defeat, this is MSU's moment
Kara Keating, The State News When thinking about Michigan State athletics, the first thing that comes to mind is often the football team or the men's basketball team. For other fans, they tend to point out the men's soccer team, especially after they posted 14-4-4 in the regular season are beginning to be known as a powerhouse. For the first time in 50 years, the Spartans are making their appearance in the Final Four after losing players to injury, going through scoring droughts and being eliminated in the Elite Eight four times in the past five seasons. This is their chance to earn the victory they have been dreaming of. With Head Coach Damon Rensing at the helm since 2009, the team has a 2018 NCAA Tournament record of 11-5-3. The team has been named co-champions twice ""î once back in 1967 and again in 1968 ""î but this is their moment to shine and win it all as independent champions. The Spartans would defeat some of the top teams in the Big Ten Conference and in the nation, but it was merely talked about while being shadowed by the 7-5 football team and other major news surrounding the campus. Before the start of the season, MSU fans would support the soccer team and head to the free games on campus, but they never truly got the buzz that they are getting now from Spartan fans and the student section known as the Red Cedar Rowdies. After beating James Madison University last Saturday, the team is now seeing what impact they have made. While leaving a restaurant in town after a team meal, people began applauding, which is something the players have never experienced before. ""úThat just hit home on just how much of an effect this team has had,""ù Rensing said. Not only do the fans in East Lansing want another National Championship for their town, but so do these players. Senior forward Ryan Sierakowski and his senior classmates made this their goal starting their freshmen year and are determined to make it there. This season Sierakowski is close to becoming the first Spartan player to lead the team in points in his four seasons in the green and white uniform, and he is ranked No. 10 all-time in scoring, putting up 82 points in 81 games. The offense isn't the only ones hitting the back of the net, though. Three MSU defenders have scored a total of five goals together throughout the season: redshirt sophomore Patrick Nielsen, junior Michael Wetungu and senior John Freitag. Another strong advantage for this tournament is the familiar faces that they will come to play against in the tournament. To start the Final Four off, they will take on Akron for the second time this season after losing to the Zips 2-1, but they feel ready to compete after regaining players back from injuries. ""úWe don't have to watch film,""ù Rensing said. ""úWe know Akron, and they know us ""¶ You'd rather dance with the devil you know than the one you don't know.""ù Going from multiple NCAA tournament runs and constant letdowns before making it to the Final Four, this team has come together for not only the fans but also for their former teammates to earn them the title that they know they deserve. Whether they become National Champions or lose to Akron on Friday night, Michigan State will become a little more focused on what the soccer team will bring for years to come.

sports,Dominant Defense Strives to Bring Championship Title Home to Indiana,7-Dec-18,2:33 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/dominant-defense-strives-to-bring-championship-title-home-to-indiana/,"Courtesy of Indiana Athletics On Friday, Dec. 7, the No. 11 Maryland Terrapins and the No. 2 Indiana Hoosiers will face off during the 2018 Men's College Cup at Harder Stadium. Maryland comes into the matchup with an 11-6-4 record, while Indiana sports a 20-2-1 mark for the season. The Hoosiers and the Terps are well-acquainted with one another as they have met twice already this season, with Indiana emerging victorious both times. The first meeting came in Bloomington, Ind., during Big Ten Conference play when the Hoosiers escaped with a 2-1 win, thanks to a last-minute goal by senior defenseman Andrew Gutman. The second matchup between the two teams came in the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament, during which Indiana again edged out the Terps in penalty kicks. Both matches came down to the wire and could have gone either way, save for a few miscues and lucky bounces that ultimately went the way of Indiana. If the game on Friday is also a defensive battle, then it seems that the Hoosiers will have the advantage yet again. They haven't allowed a goal so far in NCAA play and don't show any signs of loosening their stringent backline. Indiana was just as stingy during conference play, in which they led the league in shutouts (12) and goals against (11). They haven't lost since Oct. 3, and their effort on the defensive end is a big reason why. Redshirt senior Timmy Mehl and Gutman have been the main players commandeering defense this season, and both already have years of experience competing in the postseason. Gutman, in particular, has been the main leader of this Indiana squad. He hasn't been just a defensive anchor; he also has been pulling his weight on the offensive end as well. The defender leads the team in goals (11) and is second in the Big Ten Conference. The Hoosiers have a loaded roster that contains four first-team All-Big Ten players as well as four second-team players. Goalie Trey Muse has only allowed 11 goals on the season, putting him en route to be named the best goalie in the Big Ten. Indiana has historically been a fixture in the College Cup. This is its second consecutive year qualifying for the Cup and its NCAA-record 20th time qualifying overall. The Hoosiers last won the championship in 2012 ""î the most recent victory for any of the teams in the Final Four ""î and have nine titles overall. Even with such an illustrious history, this year's team is definitely unique. ""úThis group is a special one amongst the teams we have had,""ù Head Coach Todd Yeagley explained. ""úThe numbers certainly speak for themselves. They're very focused, just a wonderful group to coach.""ù So far this season, Indiana emerged victorious from the Big Ten Tournament with a 3-0 victory over Michigan in the title game and thus earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. After receiving a first-round bye, the Hoosiers flexed their muscles against UConn in their second-round matchup, winning the game 4-0 in a match that was never in doubt. Their second game of the tournament pitted them against Air Force, and the Hoosiers again got off to an early lead with two goals scored within the first 22 minutes of action. From there the Hoosiers rode their defense and held Air Force scoreless for the rest of the game. Indiana's quarterfinal matchup came against its interstate rival and the No. 7 team in the country, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In their prior meeting, Indiana squeaked out a 2-1 overtime win in South Bend, and Notre Dame was looking for revenge. This game was a battle of two defenses, as neither team could put the ball in the net until the 63-minute mark when Austin Panchot gave the Hoosiers the go-ahead and ultimately the game-winning score. Maryland is led by a pair of first-team All-Big Ten players in senior midfielder and leading goal scorer Amar Sejdic and junior defenseman Donovan Pines. Although they are a familiar foe, Indiana is certainly not taking them lightly. ""úYou can't take one thing away from Maryland and feel like you've solved them,""ù Yeagley said. ""úI feel that is a strength of our team as well. There are a lot of mirroring qualities between these two teams.""ù These two squads have definitely earned the right to play on this stage, and if their prior meetings are any indication, we should prepare for another hard-fought battle that comes down to the wire.

sports,How the Terps Made it to the Final Four,7-Dec-18,2:28 AM,['Calvin Thrift'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/how-the-terps-made-it-to-the-final-four/,"Courtesy of Maryland Athletics After a five-year drought, the University of Maryland men's soccer team has again arrived at the College Cup. This year, the Terrapins have made easy work of their opponents through the NCAA Tournament thus far, achieving shutouts in all matches. Despite the story told by the numbers, No. 11 Maryland has knocked off nationally-ranked programs along the way. Most notably perhaps, is the Terps' 1-0 victory over No. 3 Kentucky last Friday, Nov. 30. Not only shutting out the third-ranked team in the nation, but also doing so on the Wildcat's home turf in Lexington demonstrates the momentum Maryland is riding heading into this year's Final Four. Given Maryland's success in the postseason this year, it may be assumed the team has been prospering since the season's start in August. Contrarily, the Terps didn't pick up their first win until they hosted West Virginia at home on Sep. 10, roughly two-and-a-half weeks into the season. Prior to its 1-0 shutout win over the Mountaineers, Maryland held a 0-2-2 record. Obviously an undesirable start for any team, the Terps still find themselves at the College Cup, thriving nonetheless. After the team's shaky start, Maryland has managed to culminate an 11-6-4 overall record; however, the narrative of the Terps' season encompasses an element of growth. An overtime loss at home to Big Ten foe Wisconsin in September found the Terps deflated, sitting sub-.500 once again. The loss came only a week after Maryland earned its second consecutive win of the year to get to .500. Whether or not the Terrapins knew in September that they'd return to racking up consecutive wins when it mattered or not, the team bounced back from the Wisconsin loss, going 9-3-2 to reach the biggest stage of college soccer. Through their rejuvenation following the loss to the Badgers, the Terrapins mustered a 4-4 record in the competitive Big Ten conference. At the top of the Big Ten, this season is Indiana, boasting a perfect 8-0-0 conference record as part of its 20-2-1 overall record. Interestingly enough, the Hoosiers are who stand in Maryland's way now as the two conference opponents are set to face off for the third time this season. This time, though, the stakes are much higher. Back in October, Indiana defeated the Terps 2-1, but November saw Maryland settle for a 1-1 tie against the Hoosiers in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament. It is since that 1-1 tie that the Terps have achieved three consecutive NCAA Tournament shutouts. The aforementioned victory over Kentucky stands as the most recent of upsets for Maryland, but a week prior to the taming of the Wildcats found the Terps defeating No. 10 Duke at home 2-0. The Blue Devils had no answer for Maryland, as they were met with the same fate that Kentucky arrived at a week later. The Terps may have an inclination to spoil opposing fans' hopes on the road, but Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara will perhaps offer an even greater outcome to be coveted. Along with two winless games worth of potential revenge, the Terps have the opportunity to knock off the kingpin of the Big Ten and the second-ranked team in the country on Friday night. The Hoosiers will undoubtedly aim to prove why they're deserving of their unblemished 8-0-0 conference record; however, Maryland is a different, more nuanced team heading into the match. Led primarily by senior midfielder Amar Sejdic, Maryland boasts a balanced attacking core featuring junior forward/midfielder Paul Bin alongside Sejdic. Sejdic in his senior year has started all 19 games for the Terps and leads the team with six goals off of 54 shots. Despite the hefty amount of misses implied in the midfielder's shooting statistics, it's clear Sejdic is comfortable taking the lead and will undoubtedly be looked for on the offensive side of things Friday night. While clearly a prominent part of Maryland's offensive gameplan, Sejdic remains without a goal in this year's two games against Indiana. Likely drawing ample and deserved attention from the Hoosiers on Friday, Sejdic will perhaps open up chances for teammates like Bin to exploit. In October's loss to Indiana, Bin scored the lone goal for Maryland, so he will look to find the back of the net again. With four goals and two assists, Bin sits behind Sejdic in scoring but ranks second on the team in efficiency. In contrast to Sejdic's 54 shots, Bin has tallied only 26. While Sejdic and Bin have been responsible for 12 of Maryland's goals this season, the Terps' roster holds three other players who have scored at least two goals on the year. This balanced scoring potential, as well as experience, might be expected at this stage of the postseason, but it provides Maryland the luxury to trust their offensive sets and find the net organically rather than play hero ball. Heading into Friday's game against Indiana, Maryland has the opportunity to knock out a Hoosier team responsible for two winless matches, but the Terps are playing for much more than revenge. Despite the tantalizing element of revenge, Maryland looks for a more rewarding outcome of playing for the College Cup Championship. With revenge as well as championship aspirations on the line, the Terrapins will face Indiana at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at Harder Stadium.

sports,Spartans Sharpen Spears for First Final Four Appearance in 50 Years,7-Dec-18,2:24 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/spartans-sharpen-spears-for-first-final-four-appearance-in-50-years/,"Courtesy of Michigan State Athletics Half a century in the making, the Spartans have finally earned another trip back to the Final Four in the 2018 edition of the all-coveted College Cup Playoff. Following a 14-4-4 season that landed Michigan State in the third spot of the Big Ten, the Cinderella Spartans hope to continue their fairytale performance in the NCAA playoff with just two games separating them and the title of the top collegiate soccer program in the nation. Although Michigan State has been 8-3-3 back home in Sparta, it will be on the road for the College Cup in Santa Barbara. The Spartans have only one loss on the road this season, which came in Fort Wayne, Indiana as the Hoosiers knocked off the green and white in a 1-0 overtime thriller. MSU has thrived since its last game against a Big Ten foe as the Spartans are winners of four straight matches heading into the Final Four this weekend. Following a first-round win against the University of Chicago, Illinois with a 2-0 victory, Michigan State found itself matched up against No. 4 Louisville in the second round. The Spartans got out to an early lead in the 16th minute as freshman midfielder Jack Beck received a lead from senior forward Ryan Sierakowski on a breakaway hook to the bottom right-hand corner. Louisville was able to tie it up one goal apiece with a strike in the 77th minute that ultimately forced the game into overtime. Just two minutes into extra time, junior midfielder Giuseppe Barone sent a free kick from the left side into the six. Louisville bobbled a crucial clearance as senior defenseman John Freitag netted a walk-off finish that propelled Michigan State to its second Sweet 16 appearance in as many seasons. In game three of the playoffs, sophomore midfielder Michael Miller lasered a first-half strike from 35 yards out, which was all the Spartans needed to edge out the win against No. 13 Georgetown with a slim 1-0 shutout. Georgetown peppered off five shots in the final five-minute frame, but their comeback attack fell short as the Spartans advanced to their second consecutive Elite 8 appearance. James Madison University struck early in its Quarter-Finals matchup with Michigan State as Dukes' junior defensive midfielder Niclas Mohr snuck a dribbler past senior keeper Jimmy Hague for one of only two goals that Hague has allowed during the postseason tournament. As the Spartans' season was dwindling at point-blank range, Sierakowski took matters into his own hands as he lifted the ball just over a diving Dukes keeper to tie the game up at 1-1 with less than 20 minutes to play. Under 10 minutes later, Sierakowski was back for vengeance again as the Spartans made a game-winning drive down the pitch. Senior defender Connor Corrigan lofted a long, arcing pass up to redshirt sophomore defender Patrick Nielsen who corralled the feed and found Sierakowski in the box for a split-second look. Sierakowski made a snap decision as he read the keeper's range from three yards out. With a hesitation move and a swift heel touch, the veteran striker finessed a curl around Dukes goalkeeper TJ Bush that capped off the 2-1 comeback and sent the Spartans to their first Final Four appearance in 50 years. In his senior year, Sierakowski has been premier on the attack for the Spartans as the McHenry, Illi. native has delivered eight goals and five assists in 22 games this season while leading the Spartans past a mighty Big Ten Conference that boasted four teams that were selected to participate in the 2018 NCAA tournament. The Big Ten commands the Final Four this season as Michigan State, University of Maryland and University of Indiana make up three of the remaining four teams still in the running to take home the College Cup. Ryan Sierakowski finished the season as the No. 4 goal scorer in the Big Ten Conference and in the No. 5 spot for overall points as well with a team-leading 21 points on the season. On top of that, his four game winners on the season were tied for second in the Big Ten. The dangerous forward is complimented well by a playmaking Barone who ranks second in the conference in assists with 10 on the year. Barone is an elusive 5'9'' attacking mid that powers the Spartan charge with 16 points tallied this year, which was good for second on the team. As if the Sierakowski-Barone one-two punch wasn't enough, senior forward and Michigan native DeJuan Jones has posted five goals along with five assists in 2018 to round out a deadly triangle rotation for MSU. The trio of experience led Michigan State to the No. 2 in the Big Ten Conference in both total points with 112 and goals on the year with 35 goals in 22 games. Holding it down on the defensive end for Sparta, Hague owns the No. 1 goalkeeping mark in the Big Ten with 79 saves this year, putting him on a track for nine shutout performances in the 22 games he started for the Spartans. His nine blanks this season are tied for No. 9 in the nation among Division I goalies. Hague's .840 save percentage is the best in the conference and No. 10 in the NCAA, while his .66 goals allowed per match is No. 2 in the Big Ten. With a stout Spartans backline that only allows .77 goals per contest, the best way to slow down Michigan State is to limit its sharp attack. Yet with Ryan Sierakowski spearheading the attack and a fearsome duo in Barone and Jones at Sierakowski's immediate disposal, this Spartan squad looks to ride its unforeseen tournament run to its first title in 50 years. The Michigan State Spartans will take on University of Akron in the first game of the Final Four on Dec. 7 at 5 p.m. at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, Calif.

sports,Vom Steeg's Strong Will Brings College Cup Back to a University Campus,7-Dec-18,1:40 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/vom-steegs-strong-will-brings-college-cup-back-to-a-university-campus/,"Photo courtesy of UCSB Athletics Back in 2010, four years after winning its first national championship, UC Santa Barbara had the privilege to host their first-ever NCAA College Cup. Despite some things not going as planned and some upgrades not being able to be finished in time, the event was a relative success. ""úWe were asked back in 2010 to host in kind of a last-minute situation, and we sort of scrambled to get it done, but even today people look back at that college cup and hold it as a high watermark over the last 10-plus years,""ù Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg said. More than 9,600 people were packed in the stadium dubbed ""úSoccer Heaven""ù to witness Akron upset top-ranked Louisville 1-0. Now, as UCSB prepares to host the College Cup for the second time in school history, the university and its staff hope it can do an even better job. ""úIt's a great honor and a unique opportunity [to be the hosts of the college cup],""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úI love being a host, and I love the cycle of having one year off to relax and then getting another opportunity to do even better in 2020, but our focus this weekend is to do a good job.""ù Vom Steeg played a significant role in the College Cup making its way back to Santa Barbara. There were multiple reasons why vom Steeg felt he wanted the championship matches on his home turf. The first reason is that this is just the 10th time since 1959 (when the College Cup began) that it will be held on the West Coast and just the third since the turn of the century. Hosting the matches on the West Coast is great because usually, that means better weather in the winter, especially in a place like Santa Barbara. ""úIt's really, really hard to have people come out in Philadelphia in the second week of December to watch Stanford and Indiana,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úGreat teams, great programs, but when it's 20 degrees outside it is hard.""ù Even bigger than that, UCSB hopes to attract support for the College Cup being played at university campus stadiums instead of being held at big Major League Soccer (MLS) stadiums. ""úI understand why the Soccer Committee likes the MLS stadiums. They are usually in big cities next to big airports and they are made to hold big games, but over the last four years I have been one of the more vocal critics in that our championship doesn't reflect our game,""ù vom Steeg said. Having participated in two College Cups himself, including UCSB's historic 2006 championship, vom Steeg said he feels disappointed for coaches and athletes who work hard all year for a once-in-a-lifetime experience and the championship does not live up to the event. To vom Steeg's point, the average attendance the past three championship games has been just over 5,300, much lower than UCSB's 9,600-plus showing in 2010. Additionally, having such low attendance in big MLS stadiums makes for a much weaker atmosphere and feel to the game. In a site like UCSB's Harder Stadium that seats about 16,500, according to UCSB's Assistant Athletics Director for Communications Bill Mahoney, having about 9,600 fans will look full and help build a strong atmosphere for players and fans alike. But at a place like BBVA Compass Stadium, home of the Houston Dynamos and site of the 2016 College Cup Final, only 6,315 were in attendance. For a stadium seating 22,039, only about 29 percent of the stadium was full for a championship game. If the game was at a place like Harder, the stadium would've been at about 40 percent capacity. Not great, but still a huge difference, especially considering that vom Steeg and co. hope to garner a bigger attraction this year. ""úWe are attempting to reverse the course of the last few years this weekend, and we are attempting to bring back the National Championship to a college campus and hopefully show everybody that this might be the better route,""ù vom Steeg said. vom Steeg also said that even if the College Cup isn't in Santa Barbara, as long as it is in a community that will support it and give the championship game the feel it deserves that would be a good thing. This year, in order to prepare for a good showing, UCSB has had to improve Harder Stadium quite a bit. Even though the Gauchos were hosts in 2010 vom Steeg notes that the past eight years very well could have been 20. ""úWe literally had to start all over again. It takes a lot of work, but what we are hoping for this time around is being able to build off of this for the 2020 College Cup,""ù Vom Steeg said. At the beginning of this process of hosting the College Cup, UCSB listed out 11 projects it wanted to get done, and vom Steeg said nine were able to be completed with the rest to be finished before the start of the next college season and certainly before the next College Cup. ""úWhen people show up to the field they are going to see Harder Stadium in the best shape it has ever been in, and a lot of these changes are permanent that our fans will be able to enjoy for years to come,""ù Vom Steeg said. One of the biggest improvements at Harder was the field, †investing $100,000 in it before the start of the season. Other changes include bringing in international goal posts, putting new MLS type benches, expanding benches, increasing seating area in the ""úgold""ù zone by about 125, a new sound system at the stadium, new sewer lines for the bathrooms, beautifying the entryway, expanding the press box for media and finishing painting both the inside and outside of the stadium. ""úThe school really stepped up in helping improve the infrastructure of Harder, and it will go a long way,""ù Vom Steeg said. For 2020, some of the changes vom Steeg said UCSB will hope to implement is a new ticket booth, more improvements to the entryway, and the addition of a new video board. Overall, this weekend has a lot on the line for UCSB. Despite not being one of the final four teams, vom Steeg still sees both Friday and Sunday as huge opportunities to continue this course of action by having the College Cup at college campuses. ""úI certainly hope we at least match what we did in 2010, and I hope we put on a great event,""ù Vom Steeg said. ""úThis weekend will mean a lot but also is a project because if this weekend goes great we know we can make it even better in 2020.""ù The College Cup will feature Michigan State, Akron, Indiana and Maryland. Michigan State will face Akron at 5 p.m. on Friday while Indiana and Maryland will play at 7:30 p.m. on Friday. The championship match will be played at 5 p.m. on Sunday, Dec. 9 at Harder between the two winners on Friday. A version of this article appeared in the December 7, 2018 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Zips Aim to Continue Decade of Success with a Championship Finish,7-Dec-18,2:00 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-07/zips-aim-to-continue-decade-of-success-with-a-championship-finish/,"Photo Courtesy of Akron Athletics Situated in the Ohio city best known as the birthplace of Lebron James and Steph Curry, Akron University has become one of the most respected schools in the world of college soccer. Since 2007 the Zips have tallied an NCAA-best 203-42-29 record. Combined with an NCAA championship appearance in 2009 and trophy in 2010, they've arguably put together one of the most dominant 10-year stretches in the history of the sport. Akron also has had the most players selected in the MLS draft in the last 10 years, with big names such as Newcastle RB Deandre Yedlin headlining an impressive set of alumni. After a dominant 2017 season in which they won the M.A.C. conference championship yet eventually fell to No. 1 Stanford in the College Cup Semifinals, expectations were high heading into the 2018 season. The Zips didn't quite start off the season the way they wanted to. Early non-conference losses to NC State, Seattle University and Washington didn't have too much of an effect on Akron's overall ranking, but the team still didn't have a winning record a month into the season. A quick three-game win streak at the end of September, along with big wins over ranked opponents Michigan State and Creighton in early October helped the Zips evade the bottom of the M.A.C. standings. They ended the conference season with a 1-0 win over SIU Edwardsville and a fourth-place finish in the conference to go along with their No. 14 national rank. Even though three teams finished ahead of the Zips in total points, they finished the season leading the conference in goals (42), shutouts (8) and assists (22). ""úWe had our ups and downs during the season,""ù explained senior goalie Ben Lundt. ""úBut when we realized that we [just had to] take every game 90 minutes [at a time], we realized that we could beat any team anywhere.""ù Akron floated through their conference tournament, outscoring their opponents 8-2 and earning a spot in the NCAA College Cup. The Zips dominated both Rider University and No. 20 Syracuse 3-1 in their first two games. They then squeaked by No. 2 Wake Forest 1-0 to set up an Elite Eight matchup with the No. 2 ranked Stanford Cardinal that had knocked them out of the tournament the year before. Akron ended up getting their revenge and beating the Cardinal 3-2 to advance to the Semifinals where they are now set to take on a familiar foe in Michigan State. A player to watch in this matchup will be Akron sophomore forward David Egbo. Egbo led the team and conference in both goals (12) and overall points (29), and he will be looking to make a mark in the late stages of the College Cup for the first time in his young career. The forward made a monstrous improvement of 11 goals and one assist from his freshman year, and although he hasn't had a breakout game so far in the postseason, he definitely is due. Junior forward Marcel Zajac has also been dominant on the offensive end for the Zips. Although he is second in the conference in goals (10) only behind his teammate Egbo, Zajac has also taken on the mantle of a playmaker. The forward led the team in assists this year and was tied for fourth in the conference (8). Although his goal total shows that he is capable of taking and making shots on his own, Zajac has seemingly unlocked another level to this Akron offense by focusing on being a distributor. With Egbo up top ready to knock in any ball close to the goal, Zajac has made sure that his teammates stay involved as well as maintained the synergy between the forwards and midfielders on his team. This teamwide synergy has been one of Akron's greatest strengths all season. The team's game-winning goal last week against Stanford went viral on Twitter, not because of the goal itself, but because of the 34 consecutive passes leading up to it. ""úThe strength [of this team] is their collective spirit,""ù Head Coach Jared Embick explained in his pre-Cup press conference. ""úThey're really together, and they fight like heck out there. When they do that, the talent comes through. When they focus on that fighting spirit and being a team, you see what we could do out there.""ù One drawback to this focus on a teamwide offense and more European-style passing is that the Zips' goal scoring can stagnate when faced with a defense that is content with letting them play with the ball. Against a hungry Michigan State squad making their first appearance in the Final Four in 50 years, Akron will have to be able to push the place and play rougher than usual. Overall, the Zips seem like a good bet to win the College Cup. The combination of Final Four experience that the players from last year's team have with breakout performances by their young stars this year makes this one of the most balanced teams in the country. As they get set to take on a familiar foe in an unfamiliar environment, Akron has a special chance for a storybook ending to a decade of dominance.

As the conference season is now almost a couple weeks away, the Gauchos find themselves in their tenth match of the year; about a quarter into their calendar campaign. Following last Saturday's home game victory over the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff, which resulted in a 55-45 final score in favor of the hosts, the Gauchos now stand at a 7-2 overall record this far through the season. If UCSB manages to snag a visiting win, against the Rice Owls, that'll be good enough to bring their team win percentage to .800; in comparison to the other Big West Conference opponents, UCSB is ranked second overall in the standings, only a pair of wins behind UC Irvine who have played two more games than the Gauchos. As for the hosting Rice Owls, they'll want to pick up the pace as their 4-6 overall record has proven subpar. They will, however, be coming off their most recent victory against a St. Edward's side, which ended in favor of the hosts by a final score of 78-73. Although, before that win the Owls were on a four-game losing streak that they'll want to forget about as soon as possible. In terms of conference standings, under Conference USA, they find themselves in the bottom third overall. Historically speaking, UCSB has faced Rice two times in the program's past, and have never dropped a game in that time; with their last meeting occurring back in 1973. Away games are always tricky to speculate on, but the Gauchos will look to continue their winning ways and maintain their undefeated status over the Owls. Defense has been the main point of emphasis for this Gauchos side in recent weeks, and it has definitely paid off. However, following the most recent UAPB match, the team will want to limit turnovers as much as possible and capitalize on scoring opportunities as they come. In terms of players to watch for the Gauchos, two guards have now passed the 100-point mark this far through the season. First, graduate Ar'mond Davis leads his side in scoring with a total of 129 points on the year. Sophomore JaQuori McLaughlin, who is first in minutes played for UCSB, is second in scoring with a total of 100 flat to his name. Speaking of sophomore guards, Devearl Ramsey continues to shine in his playmaker role, in Max Heidegger's absence; Ramsey is tied, with McLaughlin, for leading UCSB in assists, with a total 34 already. On the opposition's end, the Gauchos will have to deal with four different scorers who have all surpassed the 100-point mark for the Owls. Leading in scoring is Rice's junior guard, Ako Adams, who has made 124 total points; Adams also leads his side in playmaking with 33 assists so far through the season. Graduate forward Jack Williams will be another key player that the Gauchos will have to contend against on both sides of the court. At 6'8""ù, Williams was one of those four plus 100-point scorers, with 106 to his name, and he is also the Owls' leading rim protector; the big man boasts 73 total rebounds, 17 of which were on offensive and the remaining 56 on defense. UCSB will travel to Tudor Fieldhouse, in Houston, Texas, for their matchup against Rice University. Tipoff off time is this Saturday, December 15, at 12 PM noon.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Max Heidegger made his long-anticipated season debut in Houston, Texas on Saturday as the UCSB men's basketball team held off the Rice University Owls in a 99-89 overtime thriller. Although questions arose about how the star guard would insert himself back into the Gauchos rotation, Heidegger's return to the attack was as smooth as the Gauchos three-point stroke from deep. UCSB knocked down 48.6% of perimeter shots as they opened the game on a 12-0 run from four straight triples including two that came from sophomore Jaquori Mclaughlin. Mclaughlin finished with 22 points while shooting 7-10 on field goals. He hit on a game-high 6-8 from three in addition to tallying four assists in the process. His starting backcourt counterpart sophomore Devearl Ramsey was magnificent leading the Gaucho's attack in crunch time, as he added 8 points right off the bat in overtime en route to a career-high 21-point night with five three pointers. ""ú[Devearl] had 3 assists and one turnover. All I care about is don't turn the ball over,""ù chimed Head Coach Joe Pasternack after the game. ""úWe get him to go 5-7 from three""¶ that's a bonus, that's huge. We needed every single one of them.""ù Down 12 points within the first 2 minutes to open the game, the Owls clawed back and took command with a 31-7 stretch to put Rice up 31-19 with 4:21 to play in the first half. The scoring stretch was capped off by a three-point play by freshman guard Chris Mullins who added 21 points in 40 minutes for the Owls and while going 6-16 from the field. Each team traded jumpers as the half ticked to a close with Rice up by 10 in the final second. With just a flash of time on the clock, Heidegger muscled the ball past the timeline and drew a shooting foul from three with just .1 seconds left. The Oaks Christian High School product sunk all three free-throws and moved the Gauchos within 7, down 39-32 at the break. Heidegger immediately assumed a quarterback role in the attack whenever he came on the floor. In his return, the preseason first team All-Big West Conference honoree added 22 points in 29 minutes off of the bench while shooting 6-16 from the field. The Gaucho's offense lit up at the start of the half as they opened up on a 13-2 scoring run in which Devearl Ramsey and Heidegger collaborated for 11 of 13 out of the gate in the second half. Just minutes after entering the half off the bench, Heidegger put an exclamation mark on the Gauchos opening push when he connected with consecutive threes as he launched the latter from over 35-feet out to put UCSB on top for the first time since the 11-minute mark in the first half. Following a trio of free-throws from graduate guard Armond Davis with 13:16 on the clock, the momentum had officially shifted as the visiting Gaucho's had now taken a 50-45 lead. UCSB silenced the crowd with its suffocating defense on the ensuing possession which forced a telegraphed pass from freshman guard Trey Murphy III. Just in front of the midline, senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon jumped in front of Murphy's feed and finished with a flush in transition on the other end. While the Gauchos continued their offensive production spearheaded by the Mclaughlin-Heidegger attack in the second half, Chris Mullins and junior Robert Martin finished with 10 and 11 points respectively to set the scene for a last-ditch comeback in the final 4 minutes. Following a quick release trey from Mclaughlin with 3:41 left on the clock, the Owls finished off regulation with a 9-2 run that sent the Saturday matinee matchup into overtime at 77-77. Devearl Ramsey took matters into his own hands as the game made its way into extra time. Ramsey dazzled by adding 8 points in the first minute and a half as he splashed two from downtown along with a driving teardrop at the rack to put UCSB up 87-82. The Gauchos carried their lead to the finish line as they went 10-10 from the stripe in overtime to close out the thriller. SB hit 23 of 24 free throws compared to the Owls who went 18-34 from the line. ""úIt doesn't matter who you're playing; the same things matter. Do you hit your free throws on the road? In Washington we didn't. Here we went 23 of 24 from the free throw line,""ù said Coach Pasternack.

sports,New Lineups Ahead? Full-Strength Gauchos Key in on Final Non-Conf. Game Against Neb. Omaha,19-Dec-18,11:36 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2018-12-19/new-lineups-ahead-full-strength-gauchos-key-in-on-final-non-conf-game-against-neb-omaha/,"Nexus File Photo While the thought of Big West play lingers for the 8-2 UCSB men's basketball team, the Gauchos will first head to the mid-west to face Nebraska Omaha for its final non-conference road game of the season. After the game, UCSB will return home for a nice five-game home stand which stretches into the start of Big West play. On top of having just a 4-7 record to start the season, the Mavericks will have a tall task in front of them as UCSB's star guard Max Heidegger has finally recovered from a concussion he sustained earlier this year. The junior made his return for the Gauchos last weekend in a 99-89 overtime win against Rice University after he missing the first nine games of the season. Nebraska Omaha sports three players who average double-digits in the points column with senior guard Zach Jackson spearheading the attack, averaging 18.1 points per contest on a very efficient 50.8% shooting from the field. He also adds 3.2 boards per game. Jackson erupted for a season-high 33 points against Montana State on back in late November, but just this past Saturday, Idaho held him to a season-low six points. It was the first time this year Jackson was held under double figures. Junior guard JT Gibson is Jackson's back court compliment who averages 13.9 points per game. In all but two games either Jackson or Gibson has led the team in scoring after each game. Jaquori McLaughlin will likely get the assignment on Jackson as he gets the most difficult defensive matchup game-by-game and usually excels in shutting down the opposing teams' top scorer. Offensively, McLaughlin reaped the benefits of Heidegger's return back to action as the sophomore accounted for 22 points in the win against Rice. Even more impressive, McLaughlin's three-point shot finally came alive as he shot a season best 6-8 from beyond the arc. As for Heidegger the guard's return to the court was near flawless. Not only did Heidegger improve the Gauchos offensive production with his scoring ability but his mere presence on the court stretches the floor and creates opportunities both on the perimeter and in the paint. Before Max's return, team captain Devearl Ramsey was producing more with his ball distributing than his scoring ability, but with Heidegger on the floor, Ramsey was able to get more open looks from deep as he went 5-7 from the perimeter en route to a career-high 21 points. Against Rice, Ramsey contributed eight of the first 10 points in OT to ultimately clinch the win for Santa Barbara. The most enticing aspect of Heidegger's return has to be the uncertainty about the starting roster. While this Gaucho team is deeper than any UCSB squad in recent memory, is Joe Pasternack gutsy enough to have Heidegger come off the bench? Before Heidegger's return, UCSB still held a very strong 7-2 overall record and were a few plays away from securing an upset win at Washington showing that this is a team that was able to produce throughout his absence. Heidegger improves the Gauchos offense when in the game highlighted by their season high 99-point performance on Saturday, but as a result the defense can sometimes suffer due to the junior guard's tendency to constantly push the tempo and speed up the pace of play. The problem with playing at such a high pace is that it sometimes gives opponents the opportunity to match and put up more points. To that point, the Gauchos gave up a season high 89 points to the Owls. However, it's tough to make the case against starting forwards senior Jarriesse Blackmon and graduate Armond Davis. According to ESPN's college basketball index, Blackmon has the fourth highest player efficiency rating (PER), a measure that assesses a player's production based on the minutes they play, in the Big West at 19.76 while Davis's 18.49 PER follows close behind ranking sixth. Davis, Blackmon, and freshman forward Amadou Sow all post a top-15 PER in the Big West conference while Devearl Ramsey and Jaquori Mclaughlin are close behind. Funnily enough, freshman standout Sekou Toure has been the most efficient player in the Big West with a 33.57 PER which also ranks 10th in the country underlining how strong the Gauchos are all around. All this is to say that Head Coach Joe Pasternack has a litany of options this season, something that was a bit of a struggle last year. Last season, Heidegger played nearly 33 minutes a game, most nights more, and it caught up to him at the end of the season. This time around, Pasternack has a team that could go nearly 11-deep making them a major threat not just in the Big West but to any opponent. Heidegger's talent obviously warrants him starting but now he no longer needs to play excessive minutes and some nights he could even come off the bench to give him a break. For the first time this season, this Gaucho team is at full strength and it will be interesting to see what exactly that entails both at the start and off the bench. UCSB will face Nebraska Omaha at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, December 19 at Baxter Arena.

Cameryn Brock/Daily Nexus The holidays are here and the UCSB men's basketball team would want nothing more than to celebrate them with a win over the visiting Idaho State Bengals. The clock is ticking on the lead-up to conference play; following this weekend's game, only two more remain before the first Big West Conference confrontation between UCSB and rivals Cal Poly. Until then, the Gauchos will look to get back on track from their recent road defeat against Nebraska-Omaha, which resulted in a final score of 74-85. With this loss, UCSB's overall record on the year now stands at 8-3, and the team will be optimistic that their upcoming series of five consecutive home games will gift them a few more tallies in the win column; the Gauchos are currently undefeated when competing at the Thunderdome, with a 4-0 overall record when at home. If the Gauchos successfully defend their home court, then that will be enough to bring the team back to †a .750 win percentage. In terms of how the team's overall record fares in the Big West standings, the Gauchos are currently ranked second, three wins behind top of the table UC Irvine who have played three more games than them. As for Idaho State, the Bengals' overall record is a split 4-4, good enough to place them in the middle of the Big Sky Conference standings. Idaho State will also be looking to return to form as they too are coming off a most recent loss. On Wednesday, the Bengals fell short to Utah Valley University, which ended in a 77-88 defeat on the road. This will be the sixth time that these programs have faced off against each other. The Gauchos just barely edge out the Bengals in regards to their all-time series record, with the blue and gold leading 3-2. Players to watch for the Gauchos are graduate guard Ar'mond Davis and junior guard Max Heidegger. Davis has been on an absolute tear as of late and leads the Gauchos in scoring with a total of 165 points to his name on the year, 36 points ahead of sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin who is in second place. As for Heidegger, he's slowly returning to form after recently playing in his first two games of the season during the road trip that †just concluded. For the mean time, head coach Joe Pasternack will keep rotating between Heidegger and sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey to take care of backcourt duties. On the opposing end, Bengal junior guard Brandon Boyd leads his side in scoring for the season with 129 total points. Averaging 16.1 in points per game, Boyd also leads Idaho State in assists, with a total of 31 on the year. That being said, his turnover count is also team-leading and the Gauchos will want to game plan against such a knack for mistakes. Fans will be excited for the Gauchos' return to the Thunderdome and the commencement of their long stay. In turn, men's basketball would like to start their home series on the right foot and give supporters something to celebrate during this most wonderful time of the year. It's a day game on the cards for the Gauchos, as men's basketball is eager to host the visiting Idaho State Bengals. Tipoff is scheduled for 2 PM this Saturday, December 22, at the Thunderdome.

The 109 points posted by UCSB is the most points by a Gaucho team since a 109-point performance on Nov. 30, 1985. Senior forward Ami Lakoju and freshman standout Sekou Tour√© each contributed double-double performances in the win as six Gauchos scored in double-figures, securing the top spot in the Big West heading into conference play with an 11-3 overall record. Bethesda dropped its ninth straight to fall to 1-13 on the year. In Lakoju's first start of the season, the senior posted 16 points which tied a career-high mark while adding 11 rebounds for a season-high performance on the boards. However, during a night when the Chos' most senior player popped off for a career performance, it was the young Gaucho talent that put on a show for the home crowd. Freshman forward Amadou Sow, Lakoju's frontcourt counterpart, continued to impress as he returned to the hardwood with a 14-point performance in 13 minutes while shooting 5-6 from the field. This followed his 21-point, 9 rebound night against University of San Francisco which earned him Big West Conference Athlete of the Week last Monday on December 31st. Sow has been on a tear in his freshman season. Having started all 14 games for the Gauchos, he sits atop the Big West in field goal percentage shooting 58.2% and nabs 6.4 rebounds per game good for No. 7 in the conference. Amadou Sow isn't the only Prolific Prep product that has been mesmerizing for the Gaucho faithful to follow this season however. Sekou Tour√© has been premier off the bench for UCSB, and he continued to impress with 18 points and 11 rebounds, each career-high marks in the Bethesda clobbering. Tour√© has the highest player efficiency rating in the Big West and has competed for the top spot in the NCAA the entire season while topping out at No. 5 in the country. While Tour√© poured in a magnificent performance off the bench, it was freshman Jay Nagle who stole the show in the second half. Nagle, a sniper from deep, erupted for a career-high 20 points off the bench while shooting 6-12 from behind the arc. The freshman forward was recruited at 6-foot-6 inches, but following a growth spurt over the summer now towers at 6-foot-8, and has displayed his impressive range with the No. 3 three-point percentage in the Big West splashing 46.2% from the perimeter. The three Gaucho freshmen combined for 52 points and 20 rebounds in the seventh straight Thunderdome win as UCSB remains a perfect 7-0 at home this season. Following an underdog win over Mid-Major No.10 University of San Francisco to catapult UCSB into first place in the Big West, the Gauchos have been earning mid-major top-25 votes while dominating throughout their non-conference schedule. The Gauchos rank atop the Big West with 77.8 points scored per game while shooting a conference-best 48.1% on field goals. A +45 rebound margin in this last matchup also puts them at a +9.8 differential this season, another best in the Big West. With only 9 turnovers against Bethesda, and consecutive games with single-digit turnovers for the offense, the Gauchos also hold the lowest mark for giveaways in the conference heading into the second half of the season. For the second straight year under Joe Pasternack, UCSB heads into Big West play with an 11-3 record whilst sitting in the No. 1 spot of the conference as it shifts attention to familiar Big West foes. The Gauchos will open Big West play at home in the Thunderdome against the Cal Poly Mustangs for the most recent chapter on the highly-anticipated Blue-Green Rivalry on Wednesday, January 9 at 7 p.m.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Big West Conference play for men's basketball is set to begin this week, and what better way to start it off than with another exciting installment to the Blue-Green Rivalry. Bragging rights aside, this matchup is not only one of the most important on the Gauchos' entire schedule but it'll also prove vital for the team to start off conference basketball on the right foot. Entering this game, the Gauchos will be in fine form considering their current three-game win streak. Not to mention that the team will be fired up after their most recent record-breaking victory, as UCSB defeated Bethesda University by a score of 109-47; this 62-point margin was the largest in the school's history. On the season, UCSB currently holds an 11-3 overall record. The Gauchos have also maintained a perfect record at home after being undefeated through seven games; they'll look to extend and apply their home court dominance over Cal Poly as well. The Mustangs' season hasn't been nearly as favorable. The opposition holds a 4-9 overall record thus far; just above a .300 win percentage. They will be coming off a victory of their own, however, as they most recently defeated Holy Names University by a 68-47 final result. Prior to this, the Mustangs had experienced a four-game losing streak; one of which was an overtime heartbreaker at their own home. The Mustangs have been the opposite of perfect when it comes to away games. Of the seven matches they've played on the road, Cal Poly has yet to win a single one of them. Historically speaking, this will be the 114th time that these two teams have faced off against each other. In terms of all-time series, the Gauchos have the advantage as they lead the Mustangs by a record of 79-35. The last time that both these sides met was during the Big West Conference Tournament, where the quarterfinal confrontation was bested by UCSB with a final score of 75-53. After last week's dominant performance, the Gauchos have now scored over 1,000 points on the season. A player to watch for the Gauchos is graduate guard Ar'mond Davis, who leads the team in total scoring with 199 points to his name. Freshman forward Amadou Sow also continues to shine as he leads the team in total rebounds with 90 on the season; he's also second in blocks, with 10, and tied for fifth in steals, with 6. Freshman forward Jay Nagle has also had a hot-hand lately. A key part in last game's rout, Nagle finished with a game-leading 20 points. Just as important and only a score behind him was also freshman guard S√©kou Tour√©, who protected the rim all night with 10 rebounds to go with his 18 points. Both players came off the bench in the last one, so it'll be interesting to see what role the subs play in the upcoming conference matchup. Most of the Gauchos' game-plan will have to be centered around the Mustangs' leading scorer senior point guard Donovan Fields. The offense seems to run through his hands as Fields' 206 total points and 56 total assists are both team-leading, and his team-leading 22 steals also shows his ability to step up on the other end as well. Senior guard Marcellus Garrick has also been on a tear for the Mustangs lately. Leading all scorers in their last game with 19 points, Garrick shot for 53% from field goal range, along with 50% from beyond the arc. A productive complement to Fields, it'll be important for the Gauchos to not let either player get too open. Head coach Joe Pasternak has provided an injury update for Gaucho junior guard Max Heidegger, labeling his status as a ""úmild strain of his quad""ù. However, he was practicing Tuesday night, before the game, so his chances of league play look optimistic. With the conference play portion of the Big West set to begin, the all-games standings has UCSB sitting atop of the table at first place. Meanwhile, Cal Poly's performance thus far places them in third-to-last place; this gulf in class is a clear indicator that this match should be in the Gauchos' favor. Tip-off is set for this Wednesday, January 9th, in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. Come show your support for the Gauchos in this exciting Blue-Green Rivalry matchup!

sports,Under the Scope: 2018-19 Men's Basketball Big West Preview,9-Jan-19,3:24 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-09/under-the-scope-2018-19-mens-basketball-big-west-preview/,"Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus For the second consecutive year, the UCSB men's basketball team enters Big West Conference play on a hot streak†""î this year with an 11-3 overall record and the top spot in the Big West with half of the season now in the books.  The Gauchos' offense has been quarterbacked by dynamic backcourt duo sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and sophomore captain point guard Devearl Ramsey. Ramsey has contributed 11.2 points per game while averaging 3.8 assists, which is sixth best in the conference ""î not to mention he shoots the fifth highest mark from deep in the Big West with a three-point percentage of 42 percent. † McLaughlin compliments 10.9 points per contest with 3.5 assists per game, giving him the eighth highest number of average assists in the Big West conference. Ramsey and McLaughlin, a pair of sophomores, control the ball on the attack for the offense, but it is graduate guard Ar'Mond Davis who delivers the bulk of the scoring for the Gauchos with 14.2 points per game. Davis adds 5.4 rebounds per game as a multifaceted offensive threat that crashes the boards, along with freshman forward Amadou Sow. Speaking of Sow, the freshman won his first career Big West Men's Basketball Player of the Week award after a 21-point, nine-rebound performance against mid-major No. 10 University of San Francisco. Sow is the most efficient shooter in the Big West Conference, shooting 58.2 percent on field goals.  There have been flashes of stardom from the other two freshmen on the team as guard S√©kou Tour√© has the highest player efficiency rating in the Big West and as forward Jay Nagle owns the third best three-point percentage in the conference with 46.2 percent.  With such a well-rounded team for the Gauchos this season, the real question is who will face the wrath of Head Coach Joe Pasternack in his second season with Santa Barbara. Take a look at all of the teams in the fight for the Big West crown: UC Irvine, 12-4 The Anteaters held the top spot in the conference for the majority of the first half of the season before losing a couple toward the end of their non-conference schedule. Neck and neck with the Gauchos, Irvine has earned the mid-major No. 15 spot with a 12-4 record, placing the team second in the Big West.  The Eaters opened the year up 7-0 with big wins against Texas A&M and Santa Clara. They followed it up with another impressive victory of 80-75 over Saint Mary's College in late November but finished off their non-conference season with a pair of losses a month later.  Still, this Irvine team has a remarkable rotation with a dangerous and experienced duo of guards in the backcourt in, thanks to junior guards Evan Leonard and Max Hazzard who bolster Irvine's deadly three-point attacks. Irvine's 36.2 percent from deep is ideal when competing against the first-place Gauchos, who allow just 28.1 percent from the three, the 13th best in the NCAA. UCI's graduate forward Jonathan Galloway sits in the No. 2 spot of the Big West in rebounding with 7.3 boards per game while senior forward Elston Jones supports with 7.1 rebounds per game, fifth in the conference. The pair of big men patrol the paint as well as any frontcourt in the Big West, allowing just 66.6 points against per contest which ranks slightly below UCSB's top mark of 64.3 average points allowed. The Anteaters, who surrender just 38 percent of field goals from opponents, thrive on the defensive end with the best defensive shooting percentage in the Big West. This makes the Eaters the most significant threat against UCSB which currently shoots a conference best of 48.1 percent from the field this year. University of Hawaii, 9-5 Winners of three games straight, the Rainbow Warriors have emerged as legitimate contenders to make a run for the title of Big West Champion as they currently sit in third place heading into the latter half of the year.  Hawaii has a solid collective of starters that can score the ball well, as four players average double-figures in points led by junior guard Eddie Stansberry who posts 13.2 points per game following a 26-point performance against Alabama A&M. While Stansberry delivers the most scoring on average, it is sophomore guard Drew Buggs who strikes with a pass-first mentality. Buggs owns the second highest assists per game in the Big West, averaging 5.0 per contest.  Buggs has an array of weapons at his disposal with Stansberry running the wing but when the Warriors look to move the ball inside, junior Zigmars Raimo is the likely recipient. Raimo, a Latvia native, rebounds at the fifth highest rate in the Big West with 7.1 boards per game while shooting 57 percent from the field, placing him as third in the conference.  Hawaii recorded statement wins against University of Colorado at Boulder and Utah earlier in the non-conference half of the season to build up its resume and makes an underdog run for the Big West title come conference play.  Cal State Northridge, 6-10 Following a 6-24 season, one of the most disappointing years in program history, Cal State Northridge wiped the slate clean with the hire of first year Head Coach Mark Gottfried, in addition to adding former NBA Champion Mo Williams to the assistant coaching staff.  The new-look leadership is certainly a huge reason why the Matadors rank among the best offenses in the Big West, but without freshman phenom Lamine Diane, CSUN could be in the same position as the season prior. Diane has catapulted CSUN into fourth place in the conference through his Big West best of 24.3 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. The freshman also ranks among the top defenders with 1.7 steals per game while blocking 2.3 shots on average, both coming in first in the Big West as well.  However, the CSUN attack doesn't just rely on Diane's two-way ability. While the freshman tops out the Big West as the No. 1 scorer, it is sophomore guard Terrell Gomez who delivers 18.4 points on average for the third best mark among Big West players.  Complementing Gomez in the backcourt, freshman guard Darius Brown II produces a play-making boost with 5.1 assists per contest, another first place in the Big West. While Irvine is UCSB's biggest threat on the defensive end, the Matadors are certainly the top threat on offense with their harrowing attack. CSUN ties UCSB in first with 77.8 points per game while passing the ball better than any other team in the Big West.  The only thing holding CSUN back? Its sluggish defense. The Matadors are last in opponent field goal percentage, allowing a massive 82.9 points per contest. There may be some kinks to smooth out but CSUN is a contender for the long hall with a trio of young, ambitious attackers and new leadership at the helm. Long Beach State, 6-10 Tied for fourth in the conference with two other squads, the 49ers look to turn their season around come conference play.  Beach has relied on the dynamic offensive production by senior guard Deishuan Booker who has posted 14.2 points per contest, the third most in the Big West. In the paint, redshirt senior center Temidayo Yussuf drags down 7.2 rebounds per game for the Niners as he contributes 12.9 points on average. Yussuf shoots at the seventh best rate in the Big West, knocking down 49.7 percent on field goals, but Long Beach still struggles offensively. The Niners have shot just 41.7 percent from the field this season, the lowest mark in the Big West, while they fail to take care of the ball as well, with conference-high 16.0 turnovers per game.  While CSUN appears to be in first-place contention for years to come with a trio of talented young players, Long Beach seems to be searching for its next generation of studs as all three of its top leading scorers are seniors and will depart from the program next year. UC Riverside, 5-10 Talk about a team that can shoot the three well. Between junior guard Dikymbe Martin and sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy, the Highlanders have one of the most dangerous three-point duos in the Big West. Martin is the only double-digit scorer on the Highlanders with 15.9 points per game as the fifth best scorer in the conference, but he also hits on 44.8 percent from behind the arc. As for Kennedy, the sophomore out of Moreno Valley owns the most efficient three-point percentage in the conference, shooting 56.3 percent from deep along with his 7.5 points per game which is second on the Riverside roster.  Just a hundredth of a percent behind UC Irvine, Riverside is second in the Big West in shooting from the perimeter with 37 percent but struggles to get second chance opportunities on misses.  Nobody on the Highlanders roster brings down over 4.5 rebounds per game as UCR is the second worst rebounding team in the Big West, solely in front of last-place UC Davis. Expect minimal post play while jumpers are hoisted from deep since the Highlanders shoot the most three-pointers in the Big West. But who can blame them? With a pair of spot-up shooters like Martin and Kennedy, all eyes should be around the perimeter.  Cal Poly, 4-9 The Mustangs have hit a metaphorical wall in the world of Big West basketball. The last time Cal Poly had a winning team was during the 2012-13 season and coming off a 9-22 year, Poly showed that this season is more of the same.  It's not all bad for the Mustangs who have a leader in senior point guard Donovan Fields who posts 15.8 points per game to go along with 4.3 assists. Similarly, sophomore wing Mark Crowe is a dynamic threat from virtually anywhere on the floor as he shoots the fifth best rate from the field in the Big West while also splashing 51.6 percent from range, No. 2 in the conference.  However, much like the Highlanders, Cal Poly doesn't have a solid facilitator to protect the restricted area in its strife to get rebounds.  Only two of Cal Poly's four wins have come against Division I programs ""î one of those schools is playing its first season in Division I. Cal State Fullerton, 4-10 Coming off of a Cinderella Big West Tournament last season that ultimately landed them in March Madness, Fullerton loaded its front half of the season with difficult matchups throughout.  The Titans have a pair of two of the most effective scorers in the Big West as seniors [[senior guards]] Kyle Allman Jr. and Khalil Ahmad pose significant threats to any defense. Allman Jr. adds 18.5 points per game while Ahmad follows close behind with 18.2 on average.  With junior forward Jackson Rowe averaging 7.2 rebounds per game in the post, the third most in the Big West, Fullerton seems to have all the bases covered. So, the lingering question remains: what the heck is this team doing wrong? My answer: playing teams that are, quite simply, better than them. Fullerton gets little to no production from its offense, barring the three aforementioned starters.  Yet, with a dangerous offense, don't count out the Titans. CSUF looks like the ideal team to impede a playoff-hopeful team with its dynamic scoring duo, so make sure to remember the Titans when they face off against top teams in the Big West.  UC Davis, 4-10 Sitting in dead last, the Aggies have suffered a heartbreaking year. Heading into 2018-19, Davis had eyed a repeat crown as Big West regular season champions. The Aggies returned every starter from last year's first place roster, but the results are drastically different. Davis hasn't won a game on the road this season, going a shocking 0-7 when playing away this year.  With senior forward AJ John out with an injury halfway through the season, senior guard and 2017-18 Big West MVP TJ Shorts II is left to bear the scoring burden. His 14.2 points per game just haven't been enough to carry the Aggies' struggling offense, which scores only 62.9 points each contest, the least in the Big West. The Aggies have trouble shooting from deep and have been unable to match teams on the boards with a -3.6 rebounding margin, another Big West Conference low.  On paper, the Aggies should be a fierce competitor with 2017-18 Coach of the Year Jim Les at the helm but on the hardwood, finding points have been slim pickings, something they hope will turn around come Big West play.

Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus The UCSB men's basketball team was triumphant in its Big West debut with an electrifying 65-56 win over the Cal Poly Mustangs.  The Gauchos remain at the top of the conference standings with a 1-0 conference, 12-3 overall record while Cal Poly is now in last place in the Big West with a 0-1 conference, 4-10 record. After the big win, it's safe to say that the Thunderdome is back.  From the new high definition video board to the masses of students in attendance, UCSB is steadily building up its best home-court advantage in almost a decade. The fans were jumping out of their seats and the energy in this Blue-Green rivalry seemed to even surpass the rivalry on the soccer field. The Gauchos came out the gates with a burst of energy of their own.  They started off the game hot from the three, as Jaquori Mclaughlin knocked down his first two triples, and combined with an early Ar'mond Davis deep shot, UCSB jumped out to an early 11-5 lead. However, after a very early timeout, the Mustangs showed that they weren't going to go down easy. Donovan Fields put up two quick buckets to cut the lead to three and effectively stopped the Gauchos early run. The junior guard has commanded the offense all season for the Mustangs, averaging a team-leading 16.1 points to go along with 4.6 assists.  Although most defenders that the Gauchos threw at him had a significant height advantage, Fields was still able to get to the basket at will, and he ended the game with a team-high of 19 points. The main theme of the first half for UCSB was fluidity. Coach Pasternack made five subs in the first five minutes, which allowed the Gauchos to play an intense switch-heavy defense to start off the game. Combined with great off the ball movement on the offensive end, UCSB's hockey-style substitutions meant that the rock was not in any one player's hand for long.  Although they started off hot from the three-point range, the Gauchos also didn't settle for long jumpers as the ball zipped around on offense, leading to easy buckets for the frontcourt. A layup by freshman Amadou Sow, followed by a thunderous Robinson Idehen dunk in the next possession, lit up the Thunderdome and gave UCSB a 24-14 lead with just under seven minutes to go. Cal Poly did not back down, however, and a quick 11-2 run by the Mustangs cut the lead down to just one point with two minutes to go in the half. Cal Poly was not very efficient from three, but back to back deep jumpers by Donovan Fields and Kuba Niziol forced the Gauchos to call a time-out, and it seemed as if the two teams would be deadlocked going into the half. Jaquori Mclaughlin had other plans, however. After a couple of quick buckets by freshman Sekou Toure, the Oregon State transfer knocked down his fourth three of the half to put UCSB up 35-27 going into halftime. The two teams started the second half off by trading buckets.  Although the frenetic pace at the start of the game favored UCSB, the Mustangs were able to slow the game down in the second period. Freshman Daxton Carr knocked down a couple buckets to bring the score to 43-41 with 14 minutes to go, and for a second it seemed as if Cal Poly had finally worn down the switch-heavy Gaucho defense. However, just as the Mustangs were poised to take the lead, UCSB kicked into another gear.  ""úI think it's always about our defense,""ù Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained postgame. ""úHolding them to 37 percent from the field was the key to the game for us.""ù The Gauchos stifled Cal Poly in the last 10 minutes, but another important factor was cleaning up the glass to finish off their solid defensive possessions. UCSB ended with a 45-35 advantage in rebounding, and their +16 second-chance point margin showed that they didn't allow the Mustangs to get multiple possessions. With nine minutes left to go, junior guard Max Heidegger knocked down his only bucket of the game to put the Gauchos up two, and they never looked back, as the lead never went under five again. Four clutch free throws by transfer guard Devearl Ramsey helped seal the game down the stretch, and threes by Armond Davis and Jaquori Mclaughlin ballooned the lead to double digits as the clock wore down. Ultimately this was a great win for the Gauchos to start off conference play. However, they know they have a long and arduous road ahead. ""úEvery game we play""¶ we don't have a margin of error,""ù Pasternack said. ""úEvery conference game moving ahead is gonna be more [difficult], every time we play it's not gonna be easy.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the Jan. 9, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Under the Scope: 2018-19 Women's Basketball Big West Preview,10-Jan-19,4:32 PM,"['Jorge Mercado', 'Brandon Victor', 'Jake Ciccone', 'Kunal Mehta', 'Spencer Ault', 'Richard Benites']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-10/under-the-scope-2018-19-womens-basketball-big-west-preview/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Anytime the UCSB women's basketball team takes on Cal Poly, the stakes are already high. And with the Gauchos looking to secure their first win in Big West play the tensions will be even higher. When the two struggling sides meet up on Saturday in San Luis Obispo""ìboth desperate for their first conference victory""ìthe stakes will be even higher. Despite Santa Barbara entering the game with a 3-11 record, the team has begun to show major signs of improvement in recent weeks. After knocking off San Diego State in December, the Gauchos have dropped both of their last matchups by merely single digits, including a valiant 73-65 defeat in the Big West opener against CSUN. That game in particular displayed the growth of the young Gauchos side, with the team keeping the game close throughout despite junior Coco Miller""ìthe team's leading scorer""ìshooting only 2-17 from the floor. Santa Barbara's offense""ìthe biggest culprit for the team's slow start""ìhas seen an uptick since sophomore guard Danae Miller came back from injury. Danae's four assists per game leads the team, and her speed has allowed the Gauchos to play more in transition, leading to easier baskets. In their last game against CSUN, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson opted to tighten up the rotation, playing both Danae Miller and Coco Miller for almost the entire game. While the Gauchos scored 73 points in that game, the bench contributed only 11 of those points""ìwith all 11 coming from junior forward Tal Sahar. As conference play continues and fatigue becomes more of a factor, Henrickson will need greater production from her bench if the Gauchos hope to stay competitive. Only one game into conference play, it's risky to call any game a must-win matchup. Still, for two teams that have struggled mightily throughout the season, a win on Saturday will aid greatly in getting their season back on track. Given both teams' offensive struggles and defensive prowess, expect a low-scoring affair on Saturday where 60 points may be all that's needed to secure the win. Cal Poly (0-1, 3-9) The Cal Poly women's basketball team enters Saturday's match just as desperate for a victory as any other Big West team after getting thumped at home by UC Irvine in their conference opener, 75-59. On the season, Cal Poly comes in with a 3-9 record, with only two of those victories over division I opponents. Similarly to the Gauchos, the Achilles heel for Cal Poly all season has been their offense, with the team scoring only about 60 points per game. Recently, however, the Mustang's offense has been slightly more potent since the return of graduate transfer Hana Vesela from injury. In her three games this season, Vesela has averaged almost 11 points per game. As she gets more acclimated to the team's offense, her offensive output should continue to increase even more. Saturday's game will be a battle of two nearly identical teams when it comes to play style. Both teams look to play inside out, featuring their big on the inside to swallow up rebounds and finish off easy layups.  For the Mustangs, sophomore center Devin Stanback leads the team with 13.6 points per game while shooting an impressive 51 percent from the floor. For Santa Barbara, junior center Natalia Bruening has essentially played the same role, scoring 10 points per game while shooting 50 percent from the floor. Imperative to both team's success on Saturday will be their stud center staying out of foul trouble""ìan issue that in particular has plagued Bruening throughout the season. Cal Poly also excels on the boards; despite their overall struggles, they have consistently out-rebounded their opponents throughout the season. For a Gauchos team that prefers to play with four guards, it will be imperative for them to box-out and limit any easy second chance opportunities for the Mustangs. Long Beach State (0-0, 3-10) Despite being picked to finish fourth in the Big West preseason poll, Long Beach State struggled significantly in non-conference play. With both an anemic offense and an undersized core that has been dominated on the glass, LBS limps into conference play with a 3-10 record. Led by sophomore guard Shanaijah Davison's 14.8 points per game, Long Beach State averages fewer than 60 points per game. Even Davison ""î a preseason All-Big West pick ""î has struggled with her efficacy, shooting only 37 percent from the floor despite taking almost 15 shots per game.  When Long Beach has been able to keep it close ""î with five of the team's losses scoring in the single digits ""î the team has been sunk by its 59 free throw percentage. While Long Beach has played with a relatively solid defense ""î they currently hold opponents to 43 percent from the floor ""î their Achilles heel all season has been their lack of rebounds. On average, Long Beach State has been outrebounded by 16 rebounds per game, allowing their opponents to have second-chance opportunities despite their solid initial defense. Still, they will enter conference play with a bit of momentum on their side after winning their last two non-conference matchups, including a 50-48 victory over Utah State in their last game. During that game, graduate transfer forward Cydnee Kinslow made her season debut after sitting out the first 12 games injured, and immediately made her presence known by grabbing nine rebounds in 37 minutes. The addition of Kinslow should help Long Beach play more competitively. †††Though Long Beach State has struggled most of the season, don't be surprised if Davison cleans up her offensive efficiency and leads the team to a .500 record in the conference. UCI (1-0, 13-1) The UC Irvine women's basketball team was selected to finish in third place by the Big West preseason poll with only sophomore forward Jordan Sanders earning a spot on the preseason All-Conference Team. Now, 13 games and one league match into the season, there is no doubt that the Anteaters are the team to beat thus far into conference play. Currently, UCI is at the top of the Big West conference with a 1-0 league record and, more importantly, an 11-2 overall mark. One of the Anteaters two losses came against a very tough Oregon team ranked No. 5 in the country but the other came against a much weaker San Diego State team that is just 5-8 on the year. SDSU did beat two other Big West programs in Hawai'i and Cal State Fullerton but lost to UC Santa Barbara. Regardless, UC Irvine is the only team in the league thus far to have double digit wins and that is in large part to the performance of Sanders who is averaging an astonishing 21.1 points per game. That is not just the best mark on her team but the second best average in the Big West sitting just behind UC Davis' Morgan Bertsch. Sanders also leads her team in rebounds per game with 5.5 boards per contest. She also receives help from fellow teammates Lauren Saiki and Andee Ritter who both average double figures in points per contest. † With three stud players on offense, UC Irvine hopes it can continue its great start to the year and possibly earn a Big West title. UC Irvine takes on CSUN on Saturday at 2 p.m. CSUN (1-0, 7-8) Cal State Northridge women's basketball team is currently 7-8 on the year and will look to get back to .500 as they played their second game of the conference schedule. It has been an up and down year for the Matadors but they were able to pick up a win in their most recent matchup against UC Santa Barbara. They are led by senior center Channon Fluker who is averaging a double double on the year with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She also leads the team with the highest field goal percentage from the field with 48.3 percent. One of the problems that the squad has faced this year is that they lack a consistent second scorer behind Fluker. With no one on the team averaging double figures besides Fluker, it has been difficult at times for them to put up points consistently. With them in the midst of conference play, it will be crucial for a second scorer to emerge in order to keep opposing defenses from keying on Fluker in the paint. On the flip side, CSUN has been very impressive on the defensive end of the floor as they have held opponents to just 38 percent from the field. Much of that can be attributed to the consistent ball pressure which has led to opposing offenses struggling to find the bottom of the net. In order for the Matadors to turn their season around, they will need to find more ways to score the basketball, which also means that they must improve their three point percentage. With more consistent from behind the three point line, it will help keep defenses honest which will lead to easier shots for every player. CSUN is back in action at UC Irvine where they will look to pick up their second win in conference play at 2 p.m. Hawai'i (0-1, 4-10) With Big West play in full effect, the Hawai'i women's basketball team is set to bounce back following a tough league opener loss to Cal State Fullerton. Overall, Hawai'i has struggled all year long boasting just a 4-10 overall mark to this point in the season. Additionally, the Rainbow Wahine are just 1-4 away from their home court. Luckily, they will return home for a quick two-game stretch with matches against UC Davis and Cal State Northridge. Just recently, Hawai'i had won three straight games with two coming against well known division I programs but it is now losers of three straight. It's last two losses have been by a combined five points. Coming into conference play, the Rainbow Wahine were hoping to turn around this season and, despite a loss at the Cal State Fullerton, they still played a great game. On Jan. 5, the Rainbow Wahine scored 68 points which was their third highest point total this season. Hawai'i's big scorer in that game was redshirt sophomore forward Amy Atwell who came up huge. She scored a career high 25 points in just 16 minutes with 18 of those points coming in the second half alone. For the season, Atwell averages just four points a game, even after that terrific coming out party. With an increased role maybe she can be a factor this team needs to turn it around. For now, the Rainbow Wahine will hope to continue relying on junior forward Makenna Woodfolk who leads the team in points per game with the only player in double figures at 11.8. Unfortunately, in the last three games she has averaged just three points per contest. Hawai'i will host UC Davis on Saturday at 1 p.m. CSUF (1-0, 9-5) The Cal State Fullerton women come into Big West play in 2019 one year removed from finishing last in the conference, missing out on the Big West Tournament and losing 12 out of their final 13 games. Right now, however, their season is moving in a totally different trajectory, as they are currently sporting a 9-5 record and have won seven of their last eight contests ""î †including a win over Hawaii in their conference opener. The Titans have a roster that contains a mixture of upperclassmen and underclassmen that provide valuable contributions to the squad. Four players are scoring in double figures on the season and that group is lead by redshirt senior Daeja Smith, whose averages of 13.8 points per game and 9.7 rebounds per game rank fifth and second in the Big West, respectively. In addition to Smith, one of the keys to Fullerton's early season success has been the playmaking ability of their backcourt duo. Raina Perez and Jade Vega both average double-digit scoring numbers to go along with their averages of five-plus assists per game, each. Perez and Vega rank second and third in the Big West in assists per game, giving Fullerton added versatility †as the two players are capable of handling the ball and playmaking for others on the floor. The ability that Perez and Vega have to score and assist the ball complements the inside scoring game of Daeja Smith and makes their team as a whole extremely difficult to guard. The Titans finished in last place a season ago and were yet again picked to finish last according to the Big West preseason poll, but with the improved play of their returning players and the addition of some elite newcomers, Fullerton will look to turn the tables on the conference and show everyone that they can be a legitimate force in the Big West. UC Riverside (0-1, 6-9) Conference play for women's basketball is now in full effect, as the second fixture for UC Riverside's Big West campaign is set for this Thursday. Coming off a close 59-67 defeat to UC Davis, for their first Big West confrontation, the UC Riverside Highlanders will look to improve as the young conference schedule begins to ramp up. So far through the season, the Highlanders find themselves at a 6-9 overall record; enough for a .400 win percentage. Signs point upwards, however, as the team evenly split their game schedule in the month of December, snagging a couple of road wins along the way. Although, they'll want to find their rhythm as soon as possible considering they dropped their first conference matchup of the new year. UC Riverside's redshirt junior guard, Jannon Otto, leads all scorers on the team with 195 points to her name so far through the season; that's a 13 point per game average. Playmaking seems to also run through her as she also leads her side in total assists with 47. Close behind Otto, in scoring, is junior forward Marina Ewodo. Featuring as the squad's premier rim protector, Ewodo leads all her teammates in blocks, with 33, as well as rebounds, with a total of 107. Together, these two tend to be at the top of opponents' game plan as they play such a crucial part on the team this season. In terms of conference performance, UC Riverside finished as a middle of the table team in Big West standings last year; ending their campaign with a 6-10 overall record in conference play, good enough for the sixth seed in the playoffs. However, they did perform very well during the postseason, making it as far as the semifinal stage; ultimately giving the No. 1 overall seed, UC Davis, a nail biter of a game after falling just short by a final score of 46-49. As far as this young year goes, their 0-1 start places them in sixth place once again. Expectations are high however, as a better league finish can set up yet another surprising playoff run for the Highlanders. Next up on UC Riverside's schedule is another Big West bout, this time against Long Beach State, who is 3-10 on the year. This will be Long Beach State's first Big West matchup, but the Highlanders should have a slight upper hand entering this one. † UC Riverside hosts Long Beach State this Thursday, January 10th, in the SRC Arena at 7 p.m. UC Davis (1-0, 9-5) They're the two-time defending regular season Big West champs. They've lost just four regular season Big West games in the last two years. They've got the fifth-leading scorer in the nation. They've won six games in a row. The UC Davis women's basketball team is the team to beat in the Big West. That's been the case for a couple of years, and a slow Aggie start isn't enough to change that this year. UCD, now 9-5 and 1-0 in the Big West after beating UC Riverside, started this season 0-3. That mark included a blowout loss to then-no. 7 ranked Stanford and tough losses to Pacific and Portland State. That start seems to be in the past now for head coach Jennifer Gross's squad. The eighth-year coach has guided her team and steadied the ship, even despite some key graduations from last year's group. On the court, the turnaround has largely relied on the back of Morgan Bertsch, a 6' 4""ù senior forward who's fifth in the NCAA, is the leading scorer in UC Davis program history. As Bertsch goes, so does the Aggie's offense. That hasn't been a problem considering the senior's production, but it gives opponents an obvious point to focus on. Point guard Kourtney Eaton has been the woman in charge of feeding Bertsch, a job the four-year starter and the program's all-time assist leader has performed capably with 5.1 assists per game. Junior forward Nina Bessolo works as Bertsch's scoring complement with 9.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game while sophomore Cierra Hall leads the team with 6.9 rebounds per game. Compared to the rest of the Big West, the Aggies love the three-ball. UCD has put up 333 threes so far this season, more than any other rival school. Only UCSB comes close with 331, and the Gauchos' 26.1 percent mark from deep pales in comparison to UCD's 32.4 percent. All that shooting and all those points ""ì the Aggies are second in the Big West in points per game at 71.4 ""ì hasn't come at the expense of their defense. UCD has given up just 62.5 points per game, again second in the conference, and are holding opponents to a Big West-worst 36.5 points per game. UC Davis is rolling on both ends of the court right now as they begin to defend their crown again. It's hard to bet against them. Big West Prediction: UC Davis (Hard to bet against the champs when they've got the best scorer and maybe the best defense).

Ramsey was sensational in crunch time as he delivered an 86 percent total shooting percentage going 6-8 from the field including 6-6 on shots at the stripe.  Victory in the Thunderdome is nothing new for the 'Chos. UCSB is 9-0 at home this season after its fifth consecutive win to remain atop the Big West with a 2-0 conference record while posting a 13-3 overall mark on the year.

We love playing here, we love the fans and we have to continue to make sure we stay undefeated at home.""ù Four Gauchos hit double-figures as freshman facilitator Amadou Sow was the pulse of the SB attack with a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds from 10-18 shooting, and he came out firing with six of the first eight Gaucho points in the game. †Sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and Davis each scored 12 points in the contest, and in the back court McLaughlin also added five assists with zero turnovers and two takeaways.  Following a swipe from McLaughlin at 14:26, the sophomore pushed his tempo, split defenders and cut to the rack before a swift kick-out pass to Davis who knocked down a triple from the far corner to put UCSB up 11-6. Although UCSB pulled ahead early, Riverside battled back behind a sharp three-ball attack spearheaded by junior guard Dikymbe Martin. Down 23-18 with seven minutes to play in the half, Martin corralled his own miss and pulled up with a teardrop in the restricted area to cut it to a one-possession game.  After forcing a miss from UCSB on the other end, Highlanders' redshirt sophomore guard Dominick Pickett nabbed another offensive rebound on the attacking half of the floor with a split-second look back out to Martin who drilled a right-wing jumper from behind the arc to knot it up at 23 apiece. Rebounding was huge for the Highlanders who led at the half 34-32 following 18 boards before the break and a +4 rebound-margin against the top team on the boards in the Big West. While the first half belonged to UCR, the Gauchos came to play in the second with a 7-0 run to open up behind five points from Ramsey in the first two minutes. Yet, Riverside continued to fight. The three ball was working for the Highlanders who had five treys in the second, including a smooth stroke from sophomore forward Ajani Kennedy who tied the game up at 46-46 with 13:37 to play.  Both teams traded threes over the next five-minute frame before Ramsey put his foot down and ultimately took over.  With Riverside up 56-53, Gaucho senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon cut to the hoop and floated under the basket before firing a pass to Ramsey in the corner who nailed one from deep to tie it up at 56. On the ensuing possession, Ramsey received an outlet pass from Sow and barreled coast-to-coast with a spin in the lane to draw the contact and count the bucket. ""úWhen it's time to finish the game or when my team needs a spark, I have to pick my energy up,""ù expressed Ramsey after his 20-point performance. ""úWhether that's defensively or offensively, I try to do whatever it takes for the team.""ù From that point on, the Gauchos didn't look back as McLaughlin delivered an alley-oop from 35-feet out to Sow at the basket who threw it down and put the nail in the coffin to hand the Highlanders their 12th loss of the season.  UCSB sits in a tie for first place in the Big West with UC Irvine and Cal State Northridge after a pair of conference games, while Riverside dropped to sixth following a couple of heartbreaking losses to open Big West play.  The Gauchos take to the road for a three-game stretch with their first Big West Conference away matchup at UC Davis next Thursday with tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m. at The Pavilion.

With the loss, the Gauchos now drop to 3-12 on the season, and sit in last place in the Big West with an 0-2 record during conference play. In many ways, Saturday's game magnified the issues the Gauchos have had all season: slow starts, inefficient offense and lack of depth.  In front of a home crowd of 1,100 people, the Mustangs came out firing in the first quarter, desperate to pick up their first conference win of the season. In that quarter, Cal Poly outscored Santa Barbara 18-10, shooting 50 percent from the floor while holding the Gauchos to only 33 percent shooting. Perhaps most importantly, the Mustangs outrebounded UCSB by a margin of 9-4, with junior center Natalia Bruening having to sit for Santa Barbara after picking up two early fouls. Once again, the Gauchos found themselves having to play from behind the entire game, only holding the lead for 21 seconds in the entire game. Outside of Miller's career night, Santa Barbara's offensive deficiencies once again hamstrung their ability to keep pace with the Mustangs. After scoring only 3 points in the first quarter, Miller went ballistic on the offensive end, scoring 30 points combined in the last three quarters while shooting 59 percent from the floor and 50 percent from deep. One of the biggest bright spots for the team this season, Miller displayed her elite shooting touch on Saturday. Outside of Miller, however, the Gauchos shot merely 37 percent from the floor; in fact, the rest of the team made combined for only two three-pointers on the night. With Bruening logging only 14 minutes due to foul trouble, Santa Barbara lacked a presence in the paint ""î forcing them to take difficult shots all night. Outside of Coco Miller and sophomore guards Danae Miller and Bri Anugwom ""î who both scored 12 points on the night ""î no Gaucho player scored more than 4 points on Saturday. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson once again relied heavily on her starters, with the Santa Barbara bench contributing only 4 points. On the flip side, Cal Poly found themself getting good looks all night. For a normally anemic offense, the Mustangs played one of their best offensive games of the season, shooting 50 percent from the floor. With seven players scoring more than 7 points each, the Gaucho defense struggled to contain the balanced Mustang approach. On the night, Cal Poly was paced by senior guard Dye Stahley, who scored 16 points on 4-9 shooting. Freshman guard Maddie Willett also played one of her best games on the season, scoring 15 points while shooting 60 percent from the floor. Still, the Gauchos should be commended for their effort despite what has been a trying season. Just as they did against CSUN two weeks ago, UCSB outscored Cal Poly in the fourth quarter in a valiant comeback attempt. Unfortunately, as has been the case for much of the season, they fell just a little bit short. Looking to get back on track in conference play, the Gauchos will now turn their attention to Long Beach State. After struggling in non-conference play, the Beach picked up a commanding victory last Thursday, defeating UC Riverside 63-45. With only a 4-10 record on the season, however, LBSU should be a beatable opponent for a Santa Barbara team that desperately needs a morale-boosting victory. After opening conference play with two road games, the Gauchos will return home for their game on Saturday against Long Beach State, with tip-off slated for 7 p.m.

Santa Barbara is currently 3-12 on the year, with a conference record of 0-2. In their most recent matchup, the ""òChos fell to rival Cal Poly by eight points, despite a spectacular effort from redshirt junior guard Coco Miller who scored a career high 33 points, which included six three pointers. Miller has been on a streak lately as she has led the team in scoring while also providing veteran leadership to a young squad are still finding their way. After sitting out last year, she has certainly made her presence felt by not only being a threat from the three point line but also by being a playmaker for her teammates as well. With the story of the game being a game of runs for both squads, it was the Mustangs who were able to pull the game out as they were able to knock down clutch free throws to keep the Gauchos from completing their comeback attempt. Although Long Beach State has faced similar struggles as UCSB with a 4-10 record on the season, they have started to find their rhythm as of late with three straight wins with their most recent win against UC Riverside where they won by 18 points. They were able to get the victory through a balanced scoring attack where four of their players were in double figures with junior forward Cydnee Kinslow leading the way with 14 points, 12 of which came from behind the three point line. Despite going on multiple five game losing streaks this season, Long Beach State has been able stay the course, which can be attributed to their recent success. Kinslow and sophomore forward Naomi Hunt have been instrumental as far as leadership goes and will look to continue to keep their teammates on the right track. With the 49ers playing their best ball of the season, it will make them a very difficult opponent for the Gauchos as they look to find their identity as a team. In order for Santa Barbara to succeed against a red hot Long Beach State team, they must keep everything in front of them and prevent the 49ers from getting easy baskets in transition. It will be crucial for junior center Natalia Bruening to rebound the ball consistently and limit second chance opportunities for Long Beach State. Moreover, a second scorer must emerge behind Miller in order to prevent opposing defenses from doubling her. There are many different players on the team that have the potential to fill this role, including Bruening, who can score easily in the paint, as well as sophomore guard Bri Anugwom, who is constantly in attack mode and can lead to getting to the line. One of the strengths for Long Beach State is their ability for every player on the floor to be a threat from behind the three point line. Santa Barbara must play with consistent ball pressure that may lead to turnovers for the 49ers and fastbreak baskets for the ""òChos. Although it has been a difficult year thus far for Santa Barbara, there are many positives to take away, especially the team's consistent effort. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson has been able to bring the best out of her young team and will look to build on the habits being developed this season. Santa Barbara will look to pick up their first conference win as they face Long Beach State at 4 p.m. this Saturday.

""úMy journey here to UCSB was actually very extraordinary,""ù Jovanovic stated. ""úNone of my family had ever visited or lived in the United States.

Prior to this season I was not used to carrying such a work load, leading this team and fitting in as the captain. Growing into that position was a hard process, but I found great camaraderie with the team.""ù At first glance, one can quickly notice the importance that Jovanovic's stats had on the team's overall performance. Through the 26 total games that he played, he closed the year with 78 goals, which impressively averages out to a hat trick a game, while also adding 10 assists to his name. His scoring production not only led his team but also had him tied for the most in the entire Golden Coast Conference. ††† ""úI'm very satisfied with what I've done; I think I helped the team out and believe I always did my best both in practice and in games. My teammates also helped me reach my individual goals and reached a level of success I hadn't expected nor planned for.""ù Jovanovic's great stat line also translated to the team's shared success. With a final Gaucho overall record of 18-8, this year's record was tied for the program's all-time best, with the last 18-8 mark occurring back in 1991. Thanks to such a great campaign, the NCAA also ranks UCSB within the top five men's water polo programs in the nation. † ""úAs far as the team goes, I'm very proud of what we had accomplished. This year the team was very well-structured; it was a group of people who all had the same goal.""ù When asked about the bright future in store for the returning Gauchos, Jovanovic said, ""úWe have a great group of people who are returning, and changing one element [i.e. his departure] definitely won't change the whole machinery that was created.""ù To add to their team's success, four Gauchos were recognized with All-GCC honors: Jovanovic, sophomore goalkeeper Tiago Bonchristiano, junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic and sophomore attacker Leo Yuno.  Further recognizing his teammates' play, Jovanovic added, ""úTo name only a few other people who didn't get the nod, probably because they had to include more people from other teams: Jacob Halle, Tommy Fellner, Cole Brosnan and Adam Lott. They and many others are all coming back, and I believe UCSB will have its strongest year next year.""ù Jovanovic's accolades don't end there, however, as his 78 goals this year was the seventh most ever scored in a single season at UCSB.  Not to mention, his career total of 178 goals earns him the fifth place spot among career scoring leaders. ""úIt's something that I'm truly proud of and happy about because it's what will remain of the four years I've spent here; it brings me a lot of joy.""ù Besides his obvious scoring prowess, Jovanovic was also asked about what he believes is the next best part of his game, to which he replied, ""úIt's usually hard to talk about the best parts of your game and easy to talk about what I could improve, but if I had to choose one thing, I hope I provided leadership and the will the fight until the end.""ù  Asked about his most memorable moment, he said, ""úThe most memorable moment of the season was the team huddle, every time before jumping in ""î the cheers that we did, as well as being able to stand there in front of the guys and say a couple of words to motivate them, hopefully.""ù This altogether concludes Jovanovic's stellar performance for the Gauchos, but if you ask him about what else is in store for him, he'll respond with the utmost satisfaction and confidence. †††† ""úI don't have any more water polo aspirations; I have been playing this sport for some 15 years and I feel really satisfied with what I've been able achieve here at UCSB. I'm now working on personal goals for my career, but I think with water polo this was may be the last year, and I'm very proud that I could be in a Gaucho cap here with my team ""¶ I'll be their biggest supporter and I look forward to hopefully watching the best games UCSB's ever had.""ù Lastly, Jovanovic added, ""úIt's worth mentioning again that the team and coaches worked hard together ""¶ ultimately, the most important thing was that we achieved something together through hard work and it's something we all fought for. It's something that I want to thank all those people for.""ù  †A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,UCSB Heads North To Take On Last-Place UC Davis,17-Jan-19,5:15 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-17/ucsb-heads-north-to-take-on-last-place-uc-davis/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Another week of collegiate men's basketball is on the cards, as the Gauchos are on the road for another Big West bout against UC Davis. On Thursday, UCSB travels up north to face off against the UC Davis Aggies. This road game is following the Gauchos' long home series of five consecutive games at the Thunderdome, with their last away game occurring back in Dec. 19 of last year. The Gauchos' 13-3 overall and 2-0 conference record is enough to place them at the very top of Big West Standings, with UC Irvine falling in second place and CSUN in third. UC Davis finds themselves at the bottom of the table at a 4-12 overall and 0-2 conference record, but a surprise win will do them the world of good in terms of conference standings. The Gauchos are red hot entering this game, considering their current five-game win streak that they'd like to extend over the Aggies. UCSB's most recent win occurred last weekend in another Big West showdown at home against UC Riverside, which ended in a 72-64 final score that favored the Gaucho hosts. On the season, UCSB stands at an overall record of 13-3, with an outstanding 9-0 record when at home. Although on paper this upcoming match may appear to be a trap game, UCSB is actually 2-3 when it comes to their performance on the road. Alternatively, UC Davis is 3-2 when defending their home court, so both teams will want to bring those respective records to an even .500 win percentage. A win for the Gauchos will bring their win streak to six in a row and further cement their status at the top of the Big West Conference standings. As for UC Davis, the Aggies will want to get their act together quickly, even in this unlikeliest of matchups. On the season, UC Davis holds an overall record of 4-12, including constantly poor showings on the road with a 0-9 away record. The month of January has been a bit fairer for the Aggies, who have won one of three matches over this period. Although both of those losses were well fought and one of them was an overtime heartbreaker, these pair of road games were both Big West confrontations and are the reason for UC Davis' presence at the bottom of conference standings. Historically, this will be the 39th time these two sides have faced off against each other. From the 38 other previous meetings, UCSB leads favorably with a 29-9 all-time series record. The last meeting between these two occurred last year, where the Aggies upset the at-home Gauchos by a final score of 71-54. Nonetheless, conference matchups are always prone to go either way, regardless of a perceived advantage. After an incredible showing last week against UC Riverside, UCSB's freshman forward Amadou Sow is this week's one to watch. At 6'9""ù, Sow enters the UC Davis game following a career-high 22 points and nine rebounds; each stat was game-leading in the aforementioned match. A vital part in head coach Pasternak's team layout, Sow has been tearing up stat lines all season long, leading his side in total rebounds, with 100 to his name, and fourth in both total scoring and minutes played. Another player to watch would be the Gauchos' senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon. Slowly starting to see more consistent minutes, Blackmon has made the most of his play time as he leads his team in total blocks with 17, and he is third overall in total rebounds with 67. Both Sow and Blackmon will feature as UCSB's premier rim protectors against UC Davis. On the opposing end, Aggies' senior guard TJ Shorts II is in charge of making the offense function. As UC Davis' leader in total points and assists, Shorts II already has 239 points and 60 assists to his name. He'll also be hungry for a win after coming just short against last week's opponent in Long Beach State, a match where he added 19 points, five assists and three steals to his tally. Coming off a team-leading 29 points against Long Beach State, junior guard Joe Mooney will be in fine form entering the UCSB game. Mooney appears to be the Aggies' three-point specialist as he leads his side in three-pointers, with a total of 29 on the season. UCSB will want to keep both Mooney and Shorts II in mind come game time. Although Davis is currently in last place, their play so far this year has been an outlier, not the norm. With the return of AJ John to the lineup for the Aggies, the Gauchos can't afford to take the win for granted. UCSB will be the visiting side this Thursday, Jan. 17, as they travel to UC Davis for a tip-off time 7 p.m. A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Ar'mond Davis Subdues the Aggies As Gauchos Win Sixth Straight,18-Jan-19,4:47 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-18/armond-davis-subdues-the-aggies-as-gauchos-win-sixth-straight/,"Ar'mond Davis driving down the lane. Siavash Ghadiri Graduate Guard Ar'mond Davis put the clamps on the UC Davis Aggies with a 23-point, 8-rebound night, and the UCSB men's basketball team prevailed 69-58 in its sixth consecutive win to secure sole first place in the Big West. The Gauchos improved to 3-0 in conference play as they held the Aggies to their lowest scoring performance since they were kept to just 55 points against USC in late December. Following a berth into the College Insider Mid-Major Top-25 poll, the Gauchos continued their Big West dominance to hand Davis its third straight loss and drop the Aggies to 0-3 in Big West play. While Ar'mond Davis impressively went 5-7 from deep en route to his prolific near double-double performance, the Gauchos as a whole shot 45.8% from beyond the arc. They held the Ags to just 27% on threes despite UC Davis shooting more efficiently from the field than SB. Reigning Big West Conference MVP TJ Shorts II posted 11 points for the Aggies on 5-11 shooting while dragging down a team-high five boards in the process, but when a 5-foot-9 point guard is the team's leading rebounding, it's certainly apparent why Davis has been struggling this year. The Gauchos out-rebounded UC Davis 37-21""ì a monstrous 16-rebound differential made possible by 12 offensive boards from UCSB which led to 12 second chance points on the offensive end. Although the Aggies attack came out firing with a 10-0 run to open up the game, the Gauchos fired back with a triple from junior guard Max Heidegger to get SB on the board. ""úThe first four-minute war, we were down 10-0. I felt like I was back at Washington,""ù joked Pasternack. ""úI better change my pregame speech and my half time speech.""ù Heidegger quarterbacked a 14-4 stretch for UCSB after freshman guard Sekou Toure muscled into the paint for consecutive offensive rebounds and dipped it back to a wide-open Jay Nagle, and the three-point specialist struck again to tie it up at 14 with a trey on the right wing. Nagle had eight points in the first half while shooting 3-4 from the field and 2-3 behind the perimeter as he added the final five points of the half for the Gauchos. UC Davis pulled back ahead with a pair of free-throws, but Ar'mond Davis answered right back with his first three of the game which came unassisted as shook his defender in isolation at the top of the arc and fired from deep to put SB on top 17-16. To close out the half, Santa Barbara posted 26 points with big threes from four separate Gauchos to lead 43-31 at the break. After one, there were six Gauchos that had notched five or more points with Armond Davis leading the way scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. Out of the break, the Ags weren't done yet. Davis went on a 14-5 run to open the half on a strong note once again led by junior guard Joe Mooney who carried out a 3-point play when he cut through defenders, drew contact, and finished at the rack to cut the deficit to just three at 48-45. That was the closest the Aggies would be to a comeback as Ar'mond Davis took over with 13 points in the second half with a triad of triples to balloon the lead to 64-54 with 3:53 to play. ""úI really challenged Ar'mond Davis about offensive rebounding last night and I think he was a monster,""ù said Head Coach Joe Pasternack. ""úFour offensive rebounds and he was a complete player""¶to get a victory like this on the road, this is amazing.""ù UCSB is off for a week off following its sixth straight victory, but has a big week ahead as it remains on a 3-game road trip with games at Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach next Thursday and Saturday respectively.

sports,"UCSB Outlasts Long Beach 60-54, Picks Up First Conference Win",21-Jan-19,7:01 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-21/ucsb-outlasts-long-beach-60-54-picks-up-first-conference-win/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's basketball team picked up their first win in conference play with a thrilling victory over Long Beach State, putting them at an overall record of 4-12 (1-2 in conference play). Both teams came out firing in the first quarter with sophomore point guard Danae Miller leading the way for the ""òChos with a quick five points. Miller has been playing with a lot of confidence as late which has led to her impacting both ends of the floor. 
 Sophomore forward Naomi Hunt came out on fire for the 49ers as she made two three-pointers to give her six points. One of Long Beach State's strength is their ability to make three pointers, which was on full display to start the game. 
 The 49ers would go into the second quarter with a one point lead but UCSB would turn the tables as they outscored LBSU by three points, giving them a two-point lead going into halftime. Redshirt junior Coco Miller started to find her rhythm as she swished a couple mid-range jumpers which gave the Gauchos some momentum. Miller came into this game red hot as she had a career high scoring performance with 33 points, with 18 of those points coming from behind the three-point line. Although it was a slow start, she would make a huge impact in the second half.  Neither team could create separation from the other in the third period with both teams seemingly scoring at will. Junior center Natalie Bruening dominated in the post as she used her size to convert easy layups. For LBSU, junior forward Cydnee Kinslow had an outstanding third quarter with two threes as well as a couple of steals.  Bruening has started to find her confidence as of late on the offensive end of the floor as she is attacking the basket aggressively, leading to an increase in free throw attempts. Going forward, it will be crucial that she sustains this level of play because it will force defenses to double her in the paint.  The Gauchos were finally able to gain some breathing room as they outscored the 49ers by six points in the final eight minutes to come away with the victory. Danae Miller not only hit a clutch mid-range floater with the shot clock about to expire but iced the game from the free throw line as well. One of the keys behind their victory was their ability to hold the 49ers to 35 percent shooting from the field, which can be attributed to the persistent ball pressure. All five players on the court were communicating on the floor as well which kept LBSU from finding their rhythm offensively. Another welcoming sight for UCSB was the balanced scoring between Danae Miller, Coco Miller and Bruening who combined for 46 of the team's total 60 points. This is extremely encouraging for a team that has struggled to find a second scorer to emerge behind Coco Miller. Although sophomore guard Bri Anugwom did not make an impact scoring the ball, her contributions on the other end of the floor cannot be overlooked as she grabbed a career high fourteen rebounds in the contest.  In order for the Gauchos to build upon this game, they will need to continue to bring maximum defensive effort as they still build chemistry on the offensive end. Moreover, they will need to continue to play team basketball and avoid the ball sticking in one place.  UCSB will be back in action next week as it faces Cal State Fullerton at home on Thursday Jan. 24 in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m.

sports,Gauchos Impress at UCSB Winter Invitational,24-Jan-19,10:44 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/gauchos-impress-at-ucsb-winter-invitational/,"Sarah Kreiser gets ready to throw the ball into the net. Nexus File Photo The UCSB women's water polo team started their non-conference season with a bang, taking down two ranked opponents en route to a 4-1 finish at the UCSB Winter Invitational. The Gauchos first match of the year was an easy 14-4 victory over California Baptist.  To nobody's surprise, star freshman Amanda Legaspi played a huge role in the win, knocking in six goals in her UCSB debut.  Legaspi was an impressive pick-up for the Gauchos this past off-season. As a high schooler, the attacker was named Girls Water Polo Player of the Year by the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin and received offers from big water polo programs such as USC. Her heart was set on UCSB from the jump, however, and she already seems poised to become one of the most lethal offensive players that the Gauchos have had in awhile. She knocked in two goals to put UCSB up 7-1 at the end of the first period, and they never looked back in their blowout win over the Lancers. UCSB's dominance would not stop there, however. On Saturday the Gauchos went on to win their next two games by a combined score of 30-10. † They first faced off against Fresno State, who surprisingly jumped out to an early 2-1 lead.  Fresno seemed determined to not let the main players on UCSB get any room, but this actually opened up space for the rest of the team to get involved. By the end of the match, 10 different Gauchos had found the back of the net, and UCSB pulled away with a 15-5 win. The second matchup of the day was supposed to be their toughest one yet, as they took on No. 13 ranked Indiana.  The Gauchos were unflappable, however, and thanks to a Sarah Snyder hat-trick they jumped out to a 6-1 lead in the first period. Snyder has been a consistent positive presence on both sides of the ball for the last two years, and is set to take on more of a guiding role this season for the young talent. She set off what turned out to be another dominant 15-5 win, and UCSB ended the day that much closer to a tournament victory and national ranking of their own. The final day of the invitational did not end the way the Gauchos wanted, but they did pick up a place on the national leaderboard and came close to upsetting an undefeated UCLA squad. UCSB first faced off against No. 14 Wagner, and again it was Snyder setting the tone early. The utility player scored in the early moments of the match, and the Gauchos relied on their stingy defense to come away with a 9-4 win. This win propelled UCSB to No. 17 in the country, and set the stage for a tough battle against No. 3 UCLA. While the two squads were tied 3-3 at halftime, the Bruins eventually pulled away late for the 6-4 victory. They came away as the only undefeated team of the invitational with a 5-0 record, while the Gauchos dropped to 4-1 on the season. This was a promising start for the women's water polo team, especially considering how well the young players performed. Underclassmen such Legaspi and Mollie Simmons outplayed some of the top players in the country, and as they continue to grow into their roles this team could easily become Top 10 in the country. UCSB will have a week off and then head over to Arizona State for the ASU Invitational on Feb. 1. A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Seek First Consecutive Wins of the Season,24-Jan-19,5:30 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/gauchos-seek-first-consecutive-wins-of-the-season/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus One week ago, the hopes of the UCSB women's basketball team hung by only a thread. Following their second consecutive conference loss ""î a defeat at the hands of struggling rival Cal Poly ""î the Gauchos found themselves at the bottom of the Big West standings. But in sports, one win can change everything. Following Santa Barbara's home victory over Long Beach State, the Gauchos find themselves only one and a half games behind first place in the conference. With home games this week against Cal State Fullerton and Hawaii, anything is possible. ""úIt's always great to get a win in your rivalry game, and it was very important in confidence and momentum for us,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úI thought we did a good job of cleaning up things that we have struggled with this season, and it showed on the floor.""ù Despite the Gauchos' (4-12, 1-2) struggles on the season, the ""òChos have consistently dominated the fourth quarter. In the first two conference games ""î both losses ""î UCSB outscored its opponents by a combined score of 48-35 in the fourth quarter. On Saturday, that proved to be the difference against a feisty Long Beach State squad, with the Gauchos outscoring LBSU 17-11 in the fourth quarter en route to their six point victory. Perhaps most importantly for the Gauchos, junior center Natalia Bruening was finally able to get going in conference play, dropping 16 points on an efficient 7-8 from the floor. Bruening's ability to box out also helped UCSB dominate the glass, with Santa Barbara out-rebounding Long Beach by a massive 17 rebound margin.  ""úWe defended better, something we have talked about as a team [all year],""ù Henrickson said. ""úIf we aren't scoring, we have to be better defenders. We forced Long Beach into some tough two's, and it was one of our better rebounding games on both ends of the floor.""ù  Impressively, UCSB pulled off the victory despite making only one three-pointer the entire game ""î a shocking stat considering the emphasis on three-pointers in the modern game.  This week, UCSB will face a massive test when Cal State Fullerton (11-6,2-1) comes to town on Thursday. The Titans feature one of the most consistent offenses in the entire conference, with the team averaging nearly 68 points per game on the season. Much of the team's success on that end can be attributed to its elite ball movement: CSUF averages nearly 16 assists per game and has four players averaging double figures on the season. This movement allows the Titans to get open looks, with the team as a whole shooting almost 44 percent from the floor on the season. Fullerton is led by sophomore guard Raina Perez ""î a floor general who leads the team both in scoring (13.9 ppg) and assists (5.4 apg). Perez has been a workhorse all season, averaging nearly 36 minutes per game while still remaining efficient. Perhaps the biggest surprise for CSUF this season has been freshman guard Amiee Book's scoring off the bench. Arguably the best sharpshooter in the entire conference, Book is shooting 50 percent from beyond the arc despite taking four three's a game. ""úFullerton has a very good post and they surround her with good playmaking guards who can shoot the three,""ù Henrickson said. ""úThey do a good job of manufacturing offense, and they can score on every level. We need another strong team defensive effort on Thursday night.""ù Despite its gaudy offensive numbers, Fullerton averages almost 17 turnovers per game ""î a fact that has at times proved to be its achilles heel. The Titans also give up almost 66 points per game, meaning the Gauchos should have plenty of room to operate their offense on Thursday. If the 'Chos are to keep pace with Fullerton, they will need junior guard Coco Miller to be on her game. Santa Barbara's leading scorer this season with 14.6 ppg, Miller dropped a career-high 33 points against Cal Poly earlier this month. In the win against LBSU, however, Miller struggled to find her shooting touch, going 0-5 from downtown. The sledding should be slightly easier for UCSB on Saturday, when a struggling Hawaii team comes to town. Antithetical to CSUF's offense, the Rainbow Wahine feature a rather anemic offense that has struggled mightily in conference play. In their last conference game against Cal State Northridge, Hawaii scored only 29 points in the entire game. Still, Santa Barbara can't afford to overlook a squad that has already knocked off first-place UC Davis during conference play. What Hawaii lacks in offensive firepower, it makes up for with a defense that holds opponents to 40 percent shooting from the field. Even in its blowout loss against CSUN, Hawaii only gave up 49 points the entire game. The Rainbow Wahine are led by junior Makenna Woodfolk, a jack-of-all-trades forward who averages 11.8 points per game while also grabbing 5.9 rebounds per game ""î both of which lead the team. Similarly to Long Beach State, Hawaii has struggled on the glass all season ""î an area that should pay dividends for the Gauchos on Saturday. Look for UCSB to try to feed Bruening inside and play out of her to break apart the stout Hawaii defense. With momentum on its side and two home games this week, UCSB has a golden opportunity to jump back into the conference title race. The Gauchos will host the Titans on Thursday at 7 p.m., while their game against Hawaii will tip off on Saturday at 4 p.m. A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Moreno de Alboran Set For Storybook Senior Season,24-Jan-19,7:12 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/moreno-de-alboran-set-for-storybook-senior-season/,"Nicolas Moreno de Alboran is ranked No. 6 in the country, the highest ranking of any Gaucho in program history. Photo courtesy of ITA Tennis. Whether its high school or college, senior year is a momentous moment in any athlete's life. In high school, it's either the final run or a chance to continue playing in college. In college, it's either the final run or a chance to do something less than one percent of all Americans do: play sports professionally. For senior co-captain of the UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team, Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, his final season marks both.  Moreno de Alboran came into this new season ranked No. 6 out of 125 athletes in the country according to the ITA Tennis National Ranking. His ranking is by far the highest any player has achieved in program history.  For perspective, last season, Moreno de Alboran came into the year ranked No. 42. At the time, that was the highest ranking achieved by any Gaucho in history. Like most athletes, Moreno de Alboran has been playing tennis since he was a young boy. However, unlike most athletes, the New York native did not even start playing competitively until much later. ""úI really just started playing tennis just hitting a few balls around while I was in the Dominican Republic,""ù Moreno de Alboran said. ""úI never even took it seriously at the beginning, it was more of a hobby and a way to exercise.""ù When Moreno de Alboran moved to England, he gained new insight into how much he loved tennis. He realized it would take a lot of work, but he wanted to compete at a high level.  Still, by the time he started competing, most players who hope to pursue tennis at least in college have played at least in 100 tournaments, whereas Moreno de Alboran did not.  ""úIt was hard to get good, but as I got better I knew I wanted it so I had to compete in tournaments. But by the end, I only competed in about 20 tournaments as a junior which is nothing compared to most,""ù Moreno de Alboran said. Still, those tournaments were enough to garner some serious attention from some Division-I programs including UCSB and Head Coach Marty Davis. ""úYou know it's funny when we began recruiting him we actually did not know how little tennis he had played compared to most,""ù Davis said. ""úBut we knew we wanted him and glad we got him.""ù ""úWhen I got here Marty and Blake [Mueller, Associate Head Coach] gave me the opportunity to play and get better. I don't think that would have happened anywhere else,""ù Moreno de Alboran said.  All the playing Moreno de Alboran did his freshman year certainly paid off. In his rookie campaign, the New York native posted an 18-8 overall mark and went 15-7 in dual match play. This was enough to earn him Big West Freshman of the Year honors. ""úI was and still am so grateful Marty and Blake gave me the opportunity to come to play here and show what I am capable of. Being in a team like this, in a school like this, has helped me to develop my game so much,""ù Moreno de Alboran said.  Little did Moreno de Alboran know he would improve significantly from his freshman year.  Last year, Moreno de Alboran went 29-11 overall. He also became the first Gaucho to be invited to the ITA National Fall Singles tournament, was named the 2018 Big West Player of the Year, led his team to a fourth-straight Big West crown, earned the highest national ranking in singles in program history at that point and became the first UCSB athlete to win an NCAA Singles Championships match since 1995. This season, Moreno de Alboran already looks like he is ready to accomplish more. In just the fall tournament portion of the schedule, the three-time first team all-conference standout went 13-5 earning key wins against players currently ranked No. 5, No. 8, No. 33, No. 54 and more.  Moreno de Alboran's current No. 6 ranking is not only the highest in program history but also the highest of any Big West athlete in the last 22 years. Who would have thought that a kid who played tennis for fun growing up and didn't even play competitively until late in life would be this good? ""úYou always hope players turn out as good as Nic but you never know, how could you? We knew he had a world class forehand and he has built his game around that, but he has grown so much in all facets of his game that his game as a freshman compared to now is a night and day difference,""ù Davis said.  Even Moreno de Alboran could not have expected to be in this position.  ""úNo, I never thought I would be this good because I never saw tennis as 10 years ahead, five years ahead. I always stayed focused day by day. I never thought I would be playing against the best players in the nation and beating them,""ù Moreno de Alboran said. Moreno de Alboran (right) celebrating with fellow senior co-captain and doubles partner Anders Holm (left). Photo courtesy of UCSB Athletics Still, the work is not done. Two years ago, and even last year, making it to the semifinals or quarterfinals against the top players in the country was a win. For a small mid-major like UCSB and Moreno de Alboran usually just making it to a big game is seen as a win. But this year, Santa Barbara and their senior co-captain are ready to go beyond just making the big game, they want to win it. Last season, Moreno de Alboran came within a set of defeating the No. 1 player in the country, Martin Redlicki of UCLA at the NCAA Singles Championships after winning his first-round match the day before. That was good enough for last year, not this year. ""úNic is no longer in the stage of just being happy to be here. He knows he deserves to be here and he knows he could hang with these guys, they aren't that far in skill level anymore. Now he just has to go out there and beat them,""ù Davis said. ""úI don't see why I couldn't beat anyone in this country right now. Those rankings are just numbers I don't see them as better or worse, I see every match as an opportunity to grow and represent the Gauchos,""ù Moreno de Alboran said.  As for the team as a whole, the Gauchos are poised for major success. In doubles, Moreno de Alboran and fellow senior teammate Anders Holm are one of the best pairs in the country. In singles, this team is talented from top to bottom including having junior Joseph Guillin play at the No. 2 court. Guillin is currently ranked No. 22 in the country. Last season, UCSB nearly upset one of the best tennis programs in the country, USC, at its own home in the first round of the NCAA Team Championships. The score ended 4-1 in favor of the Trojans, but if you were at the game, you would know the Gauchos were leading on all singles courts at one point and looked like they would win on most. That was good enough for last season, not this one. ""úLast year showed us our program was headed in the right direction. We have a goal this year, to win another Big West and to get our first NCAA win since 1998, and with Nic and some of our other guys I think we could do it,""ù Davis said. Almost like it was meant to be, Moreno de Alboran and UCSB as a whole are peaking together at what feels like the right time. Just this past Saturday the Gauchos won their season opener 5-2 against San Diego State and Moreno de Alboran looked impressive. It will be interesting to see what awaits the program and the athlete that helped it turn into quite possibly the best mid-major in the country. ""úI get goosebumps when I get reminded of that,""ù Moreno de Alboran said. ""úI am super grateful for my coaches, my teammates, this school and I am super excited for this season. It is my last one and I am ready to soak everything in.""ù A version of this article appeared on p.1 and p.4 of the Jan. 24th, 2019 print edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,UCSB Heads Into Weekend With Must-Win Mentality as Conference Play Nears,24-Jan-19,5:45 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ucsb-heads-into-weekend-with-must-win-mentality-as-conference-play-nears/," Following a four-game road trip, the No. 10 UCSB men's volleyball team will return to Robertson Gym for two big games this weekend, first against No. 9 Lewis University on Friday, then against No. 5 Loyola-Chicago on Saturday. The Gauchos went an even 2-2 during that four-game road stretch and now boast a strong 5-3 overall mark heading the weekend.  ""úIt was a tough road trip but I thought we did well to come out with two wins. A real character building road trip,""ù Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. ""úOur confidence is getting good again, and we are ready to get some nice wins at home.""ù Their first opponent, Lewis, holds a 5-2 record but has not defeated any team that is currently ranked, and their two losses have come against No. 3 UC Irvine and No. 6 Pepperdine. Loyola-Chicago has a 5-1 overall record and, despite a loss to UCI, the Ramblers upset Pepperdine back on Jan. 18 in a five-set thriller. Despite all teams having five wins, Santa Barbara's road to that success has been a lot tougher considering that their last five matches have come against ranked opponents and they own the toughest schedule in the nation with their remaining opponents boasting a combined win percentage of .717.  Still, even though 5-3 is a good record, the Gauchos know they could be in a better position and have to play well in their upcoming games if they want to overcome their gruesome schedule.  ""úWe have the top schedule in the country and its because we want to be playing tough teams and get better to be ready when the playoffs come,""ù McLaughlin said. ""úWe could easily be 6-2, if not 7-1, but that's the way it goes. Sometimes it is better to lose so we can work a bit harder.""ù UCSB is 5-5 all-time against Lewis and has lost three straight meetings to the Flyers, including a 3-1 defeat in Illinois last season. If the Gauchos want to change their fortunes this time around, then they will need to find a way to break through a tough Flyer defense.  Lewis holds the 12th best opponent hitting percentage in the nation holding them to a .200 clip. The Flyers also average nearly 10 digs per set, fifth-best mark in the country, and three blocks per set, second-best mark in the country.  This means UCSB will need to have an efficient, aggressive offensive showing and also need a big game from some of its offensive leaders such as senior outside hitter, Corey Chavers. Chavers leads the team in kills per set averaging 3.29 and has amassed 102 total kills thus far in the year. No other Gaucho has more than 50, meaning that the team has a nice balance with Chavers leading the charge. Fellow teammate junior Keenan Sanders had a career day against Lewis last season finishing with a career-high 24 kills in that match. A repeat performance of that could put the Gauchos over the top.  Offensively, Lewis is very team-oriented, with five players averaging two kills per set and no player having more than 66 kills in total. The Gauchos are 2-1 all-time against Loyola-Chicago, losing for the first time last season, 3-1. Offensively, UCSB will need a similar game plan considering the Ramblers hold their opponents hitting percentage to just .174, ranking sixth in the nation.  Last season when these two teams met, Chavers led the team with 18 kills, but the next closest Gaucho only had nine apiece. More even distribution will be a big key. What makes Loyola-Chicago even tougher, however, is that its offense is even better than its defense. As a team, the Ramblers average 13.86 kills per set, .363 hitting percentage and 12.68 assists per set. Those averages are the No. 2, No. 3 and No. 5 ranks in the country, respectively. Senior outside hitter Collin Mahan is one of the biggest forces in the Rambler offense. The New York native recently was honored with the MIVA Offensive Player of the Week award thanks to a 28 kill performance in his team's last two outings, including the upset win against Pepperdine where Mahan registered 18 kills on an efficient .309 hitting. This comes as no surprise as Mahan was also picked as the Preseason MIVA Player of the Year. Defensively, UCSB will need to rely on Senior libero Hayden Boehle who leads the team with 78 digs while Sanders leads the team with 25 blocks.  Overall, this weekend will be important for Santa Barbara to make some noise on a national level in the shadows of the bigger Big West teams. Currently, the top three spots in national rankings belong to Big West teams. If UCSB wants to be there, they will need to prove it with some big wins at home.  ""úIt is always good to be at Rob Gym and I love playing teams ranked above us. They give us the challenge we need to get better and our guys will be ready,""ù McLaughlin said.  UCSB takes on Lewis at 7 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 25 at Robertson Gym. The match against Loyola-Chicago will be on Saturday, Jan. 26 at the same time and location.

sports,UCSB Set To Travel South for Big West Doubleheader,24-Jan-19,5:08 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-24/ucsb-set-to-travel-south-for-big-west-doubleheader/,"Senior forward Jarriesse Blackmon fighting for the ball. Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Men's basketball continues this week as the Gauchos face two Big West opponents in Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State, with both matchups taking place on the road. This Thursday, UCSB travels down to Fullerton to take on the Titans. Then on Saturday, the Gauchos will once again head south toward Long Beach where they'll face off against the 49ers. Entering this week of play, the Gauchos find themselves in their best form of the season. Now besting their own five-game win streak from back in November, the Gauchos' are currently unbeaten in six games and have been perfect through the month of January. At the moment, UCSB is also one of only 27 other collegiate teams in the nation who is unbeaten in conference play. The Gauchos will also be coming off their most recent road win after traveling to and defeating UC Davis by a final score of 69-58. Altogether, the Gauchos currently boast a 14-3 overall record on the season. Notably, those three losses have all come from away games. UCSB still remains undefeated, 9-0, when playing at home in the Thunderdome. The men's team will look to maintain their winning ways and continue their excellent momentum through this week's pair of conference games. Cal State Fullerton's campaign hasn't gone quite as well. The Titans are at a 6-12 overall record on the season and have only won one of their nine away games. When it comes to defending their home court, however, they have done well as they find themselves at a 4-2 home record.  The Titans' have recently been on a small hot-streak of their own. Fullerton has won their last two games, with their most recent victory being a 92-90 overtime win against Long Beach State. Historically speaking, UCSB has faced Cal State Fullerton a total of 86 times, with the Gauchos leading the all-time series at a record of 47-39. The last time these two teams faced each other came in January of last year, where a close fight resulted in a 70-65 Gaucho road win.  As for Saturday's opponent, Long Beach State's season has been a bit better. Currently standing at an overall record of 8-11 on the season, the 49ers have shared a similar form of poor play on the road when compared to their ability to play at home. Boasting a 6-2 record whenever they're the hosts, Long Beach State will pose yet another challenge for the Gauchos come time for tip-off.  The 49ers' most recent form has also proven promising, as Long Beach State has won three of four games in the month of January; as they'll be coming off their most recent, aforementioned, overtime loss to Cal State Fullerton.  In terms of the all-time series against the Gauchos, the 49ers take the advantage in this one with a 76-59 lead over UCSB in the 126 total games they've shared. The Gauchos will also look to even the score, considering Long Beach State was also the victor the last time these two sides faced; which resulted in a devastating 69-70 home loss for UCSB. Nevertheless, this season has proven much more promising for the Gauchos, as this team full of veteran and young talents continues to shine.  Players to watch for the Gauchos include graduate guard Ar'mond Davis and freshman forward Jay Nagle. Davis is coming off an impressive 23-point performance in the latest win against UC Davis, also adding eight rebounds and two assists to his total. As for Nagle, he managed eight points from off the bench and a pair of rebounds in his 16 minutes of play. † On the Titans' end, the Gauchos should expect a two-pronged offense revolving around senior guards Khalil Ahmad and Kyle Allman Jr. Ahmad and Allman are the only two scorers on their team to have surpassed 300 points on the season, and the dangerous duo has also combined for a total of 54 assists through the season.  As for the 49ers, senior guard Deishuan Booker has been lighting up the scoreboard as of late. He leads his team in overall scoring and also in assists, with a total of 78 to his name. This week's recurring theme will be prolific guards, as the Gauchos will have to game plan against their next opponents' outstanding backcourt players. A conference standings update is in order, as the Gauchos are currently the only undefeated team in Big West play. Sitting atop the table at a 3-0 record, the only other team with three wins is UC Irvine, whom UCSB will be facing at home next week. Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State find themselves at the middle of the table, both with only two wins. An important week for the Gauchos in terms of conference standing and opponent difficulty, snagging two road wins would mean the world for UCSB's competitive campaign.  UCSB is set to travel and face Cal State Fullerton this Thursday, Jan. 24, at 7 p.m., then Long Beach State this Saturday, Jan. 26, also at 7 p.m.  A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 24, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Stumble at Fullerton for First Loss in Over a Month,25-Jan-19,7:30 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-25/gauchos-stumble-at-fullerton-for-first-loss-in-over-a-month/,"Ar'mond Davis driving past his defender. Angie Banks / Daily Nexus Before last night's game against Cal State Fullerton, the UCSB men's basketball team was one of 27 teams in the nation to be undefeated in conference play. Following a hard fought 81-60 loss to the Titans on the road, UCSB is no longer one of those teams. The Gauchos dropped their first game in over a month to move to 3-1 in conference play and slide down to second in the Big West Conference standings behind a 4-1 UC Irvine team. Fullerton, on the other hand, has been playing red hot to improve to 3-2 in Big West play behind a triad of skillful and nimble guards led by senior winger Kyle Allman Jr. Allman Jr. led all scorers with 21 points while shooting 7-13 from the field and 6-6 from the charity stripe as he dished out 4 assists en route to the Titans third win in a row. Senior Khalil Ahmad and junior point guard Austen Awosika added to the action with 19 points and 12 points respectively while all three guards had over 4 assists to fuel the Titan attack. While UCSB scored the first four points in the game, the Titans' pinpoint shooting and stout defense proved to be too much for the Guachos to handle. Fullerton shot 55.2% on field goals including a monsterous 63% in the first half. The Gauchos had a 17-14 lead with 11:51 remaining in the first half after a four-point-play from freshman Jay Nagle, but that's when the Titans started cooking while SB began to freeze up. Through three games, UCSB has focused on stopping one significant playmaker from Cal Poly's Donovan Fields to Dikymbe Martin on Riverside and TJ Shorts II with UC Davis. Yet, the Titans had three elusive guards to spread the floor and the Gauchos had no answer for it. UCSB had a three and a half minute stretch with only two points when sophomore captain point guard Devearl Ramsey was off the floor, but his impact was felt immediately upon his return with seven minutes to play. Ramsey grabbed a defensive board and took it coast to coast to cut the Titan lead back to three and on the ensuing possession, the Sierra Canyon product delivered a contested trey to tie it up once again at 26 a piece with 6:22 on the clock. Fullerton turned it on at the end of the half to rout the Gauchos with a 22-5 run, 19 of those 22 points came from their three musketeers, who capped off consecutive buzzer beaters on the final two possessions of the half to balloon the lead up to a hefty 17-point deficit. On top 48-31 Fullerton ran into the tunnel at the break with the momentum fully in its control. The Gauchos muscled their way back in the second half behind 6 points in two minutes from sophomore forward Robinson Idehen to cut it to 55-42 with 14:06 left to play. The comeback felt imminent as UCSB was knocking down shots and getting stops. Devearl ramsey went on a 7-point run by himself to inch closer with 10:44 in the second half as he splashed a triple from the left wing to cut the deficit 9 points with a 59-50 lead for the Titans. Ramsey closed in with another three at 6:54 to cut it to seven, but that was the closest the Gauchos would get as Fullerton closed out another half with an assertive 18-4 run behind the final 11 points from Khalil Ahmad to put the nail in the coffin and hand UCSB its first loss since December 19 on the road in Omaha, Neb. Head Coach Dedrique Taylor made a crucial defensive adjustment in the second half as three Titans would collapse on the Gaucho ball-handler once they crossed the timeline. The Gauchos had no rebuttal for the Fullerton triple-trap and ultimately fell in the second half. While Devearl ramsey had 15 points and Jaquori Mclaughlin added 11 with a career-high 8 rebounds, UCSB struggled from deep, shooting 8-28 from beyond the arc. The team couldn't finish from the line going 54.5% from the line on 22 tries. The Gauchos allowed 46 points in the paint compared to just 22 that UCSB was able to convert and the open looks for Fullerton attributed to its 55% shooting night. Four Titans scored in double-figures including a 12 and 12 double-double from junior forward Jackson Rowe as the Gauchos fell in Titan Gym. Although their overall 7-12 record may not reflect their skill level, Big West foes will be left bruised and burned if they don't remember the Titans. UCSB men's basketball heads to Long Beach State on Saturday evening for a 7 p.m. tip-off against the 49ers in Walter Pyramid.

sports,Davis's Impressive Double-Double Performance Helps UCSB Bounce Back,27-Jan-19,4:19 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-27/daviss-impressive-double-double-performance-helps-ucsb-bounce-back/,"Ar'mond Davis driving down the lane. Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus The Gauchos' recent loss to Fullerton seemed to be a distant memory on Saturday evening as the UCSB men's basketball team returned to its dominant ways with a convincing 82-71 victory over Long Beach State. In his groove once again, graduate guard Ar'mond Davis ran the Gaucho atack and detonated for 24 points and 11 rebounds, his second double-double performance of the season. This was Davis's sixth 20-point contest of the year, as 17 of his 24 points and nine of his 11 boards were recorded in the first half. Through five conference matchups, Santa Barbara remains in second place in the Big West Conference with a 15-4 overall record and 4-1 record in Big West play. Following its third consecutive loss, Beach drops to 2-3 in conference play to move into sixth place in the Big West standings.  While 49ers' star senior guard Deishaun Booker accounted for a near triple-double with 25 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, the majority of Booker's points resulted from trips to the line.  Booker alone shot 12-15 from the stripe while Long Beach State as a whole had 36 shots at the line, compared to just 22 for UCSB. The 11 shots taken by Booker were his least amount of field goals attempted through conference play, since he was considerably tied down by sophomore JaQuori McLaughlin from start to finish.  McLaughlin has received the toughest defensive assignment year in and year out, and Booker was no different. The 2016 Washington Mr. Basketball honoree ran for 39 minutes to put the clamps on a dangerous 49ers attack. He also added 15 points on 6-12 shooting with five rebounds in the process. Davis and McLaughlin carried the bulk of the first half scoring for the Gauchos a combined 24 of the first 38 points in the former 20 minutes, while UCSB captain point guard Devearl Ramsey accounted for the majority of the helpers. Yet, much like Fullerton, which relied on a triple-trap in the second half to shut down the 'Chos, Long Beach did its homework, and, immediately out of the break, ball handlers were met by a three-man ambush when they crossed the timeline in the second half.  However, this time around, Coach Joe Pasternack had an answer for the smothering defense in no man's land ""î his name was Max Heidegger. Heidegger has struggled through conference play thus far, but his sharp intuition proved crucial to the Gaucho charge in the second as he stretches the floor with swift ball movement and active passes to the paint. After Heidegger faked left and drilled a trey from the right wing, he returned and fired to wide-open Gaucho big men Robinson Idehen and Amadou Sow in the restricted area to stretch the floor and beat the triple-trap, which was detrimental to Santa Barbara's attack against Fullerton.  Preseason first-team honoree Max Heidegger finished with 10 points, six assists and zero turnovers, as his second-half effort was essential to UCSB's success down the stretch. With Heidegger back in his quarterback role to break the press, freshman Amadou Sow came alive with 12 points, shooting 5-6 from the field in the second half on his way to 14 points in just 15 minutes as he strived with foul trouble the entire night.  Sow picked up two quick fouls within the first two minutes of the game, which limited him to minimal minutes in the first, but since all of the Gaucho bigs were frequently whistled throughout the contest, Sow saw minutes toward the end of the second half although he had already been called for four fouls.  Six Gauchos were piped for three or more fouls while Mclaughlin, Sow and senior Jarriesse Blackmon each picked up four fouls. After Deishaun Bookers cut the lead to 58-54 with 7:14 to play in the second, Max Heidegger, Devearl Ramsey and Ar'mond Davis delivered a triad of triples to inflate the the lead to eight, with the Gauchos on top 67-59 with five minutes to play to knock off the Niners.  After three straight on the road, the Gauchos head back home to host UC Irvine for a battle of first place in the Big West on Thursday, Jan. 30, with an 8 p.m. tip-off in the Thunderdome.

sports,Gauchos Offense Stalls in 47-35 Loss to Hawaii,27-Jan-19,3:24 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-27/gauchos-offense-stalls-in-47-35-loss-to-hawaii/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Despite an impressive defensive showing from the UCSB women's basketball team, the Gauchos dropped their second straight game on Saturday, falling to Hawaii 47-35. With the loss, Santa Barbara remains in eighth place in the Big West Conference with its 1-4 conference record. At times this season, UCSB has struggled to generate offense. Even before Saturday's game, Santa Barbara was only averaging 56.5 points per game ""î tied with Hawaii for the fewest ppg in the conference. On Saturday, however, the Gauchos set a new season low with their 35 points. Outside of the 13 points scored by junior center Natalia Bruening, no single UCSB player scored more than six points. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson also once again failed to get production from her bench, with the team combining for only two points off the pine. Last week, Santa Barbara proved it could win without the long ball when it defeated Long Beach State. This week, however, the Gauchos' failure to stretch the floor ultimately doomed the team, as they shot 0-16 from deep ""î a new season low for them. Some of the credit for the Gauchos' shooting performance should be given to a feisty Hawaii defense. After giving up 14 points in the second quarter ""î and trailing 21-19 at the half ""î the Rainbow Wahine put the clamps on Santa Barbara, giving up merely 14 points in the entire second half. The fact that the Gauchos were able to hang around despite their rough shooting night shows the defensive improvement of the team, something Henrickson has emphasized all season. Santa Barbara held the Rainbow Wahine to 35 percent from the floor, including only 26 percent from beyond the arc. The 47 points given up by UCSB are the fewest it has allowed in a game all season. For Hawaii, senior forward Leah Salanoa led the way, scoring a game-high 14 points while shooting an efficient 6-9 from the floor. Junior forward Makenna Woodfolk also scored in double digits, dropping 10 points ""î including six points from the free-throw line. Outside of those two, however, Hawaii struggled mightily from the field.  On a night when the Gauchos made only 12 field goals, that was all the production the Rainbow Wahines needed to secure their third conference win on the season. Outside of a double-double from Bruening, Santa Barbara's starters couldn't get anything going. Junior guard Coco Miller didn't make a single field goal on Saturday, going 0-12 from the field despite leading the Gauchos with 14.6 ppg. Sophomore point guard Danae Miller also struggled mightily, going 2-13 from the field while also turning the ball over six times before fouling out in the fourth quarter. Offensively, anything that could have gone wrong for UCSB on Saturday seemed to go wrong. Turnovers, foul trouble, the inability to stretch the floor ""î these issues all culminated in by far the worst offensive performance of the season. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, things won't get any easier this week when they travel to both Irvine and Riverside. So far this season, UCSB has only won one true away game: the 63-58 upset of San Diego State in December.  Regardless, Santa Barbara won't stand a chance against either opponent if the team can't figure out its offensive woes.  With only eight of the nine teams in the conference making the conference tournament, the Gauchos will need to get a few more wins under their belt if they hope to make to the postseason. UCSB's next match is at UC Irvine on Thursday, Jan. 31.

sports,"Gauchos Look to Surpass Big West Leaders UC Irvine, then Travel to Hawaii",31-Jan-19,4:12 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-01-31/gauchos-look-to-surpass-big-west-leaders-uc-irvine-then-travel-to-hawaii/," Now nearing the halfway mark of regular season conference play, the UCSB men's basketball team faces two more Big West opponents in UC Irvine and the University of Hawaii. UCSB kicks of this Big West doubleheader on Thursday, by first hosting the UC Irvine Anteaters at the Thunderdome. Then, on Saturday, the Gauchos will fly out to the University of Hawaii to take on the Rainbow Warriors. After their 6-game winning streak was snapped last week at Fullerton, the Gauchos will enter this week wanting to return to their winning ways. Regardless, the month of January has gone very well, as the men's basketball team has won five of the six games they've played. UCSB currently stand at a 15-4 overall record on the season; with those four losses all occurring in road games. The team will also be coming off their most recent road win against Big West opponent Long Beach State, which resulted in a final score of 82-71. That being said, the Gauchos will look to extend their home court dominance over UC Irvine. With a win against the Anteaters, UCSB will maintain its perfect record and improve to 10-0 when at home. As for UC Irvine, the Anteaters find themselves in fine form after winning three consecutive conference matches. They'll be coming off a most recent home win versus UC Riverside, in which they defeated their visitors 82-64. On the season, UC Irvine boast a 17-5 overall record and a 5-1 conference record; enough to place them at the top of Big West league standings. The Anteaters have also performed better on the road, with an away record of 8-2, as compared to their 7-2 home record. UC Irvine is a historically familiar opponent, with Thursday being the 92nd time that UCSB has faced them; the Gauchos currently lead the all-time series record with a 52-39 performance. In addition, the University of Hawaii will also have plenty of reason to upset the Gauchos, considering a win for them will have them level in terms of conference record and standing. After losing back to back games against UC Riverside and UC Irvine, the Rainbow Warriors will be coming off a most recent home win against conference opponent UC Davis; which resulted in an 80-60 victory for the hosts. The Rainbow Warriors currently stand at an overall record of 12-7 on the season, and have played their best basketball in Hawai'i considering their 10-3 home record. Historically, UCSB vs. Hawaii has always been an exciting matchup, with the latter side leading the all-time series record by a slight margin of 11-10. Players to watch for the Gauchos include graduate guard Ar'mond Davis and junior guard Max Heidegger. Davis, who leads UCSB in total scoring and steals, will be coming off a spectacular performance during last week's win against Long Beach State; where finished with a double-double stat line, 24 points and 11 rebounds. Heidegger is also slowly returning to his prolific form after a solid showing off the bench in the same game; in which he finished with a stat line of 10 points, 6 assists, and 2 steals. Both players will continue to see quality minutes as key contributors in this week's doubleheader. For the Anteaters, junior guard Max Hazzard leads the offensive for UC Irvine. Hazzard leads his side in total points, with 260, and total assists, with 36, on the season. Hazzard also put up double digits in scoring, with 11 points, in UC Irvine's most recent home win against UC Riverside. As for the Rainbow Warriors, sophomore guard Drew Buggs plays the role of prolific playmaker for his side. He leads Hawaii in total assists with 108, which accounts for more than a third of his team's combined total assists, and is a top-5 scorer with 169 points to his name. Buggs seemingly makes the players around him even better; it's within the Gauchos' best interests to find a way to halt his excellent distributional skills. A Big West standings update is in order considering UCSB no longer finds themselves at the top of the table. UC Irvine leads the pack with a 5-1 conference record, and 17-5 overall, whilst the Gauchos drop down to second place with a 4-1 conference record, and 15-4 overall. Meanwhile, the University of Hawaii follow closely in fourth place with a 3-2 conference record, and 12-7 overall. All the action starts at home in the Thunderdome this Thursday, January 31st, with the Gauchos hosting the Anteaters at 8 p.m. The team will then travel to Hawaii on Saturday, February 2nd, for a late tipoff time at 10 p.m.

Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time, I've been blessed to witness five Brady-led championship parades and the chance for a sixth on the way. Beyond the bolstering Brady-Belichick empire, fellow Boston fans have borne witness to four Red Sox World Series titles in 15 years, in addition to one apiece from both the Celtics and the Bruins. Boston sports teams have had seemingly uninterrupted success for the past two decades. For the past 13 consecutive years, a Massachusetts-rooted professional sports organization has reached a championship round of the playoffs. Yet, while every modern sports city was chasing Boston's abundance of success, a former sports superpower has emerged as a contemporary contender. The Los Angeles Lakers thrived under the era of Kobe while L.A. celebrated with two recent Stanley Cup championships handed down by the Kings. Even with substantial success in the Staples Center, Boston has undoubtedly always had an upper hand on the title of ""úgreatest sports city""ù due to its reigning dominance on the football field. But as times have changed, Hollywood relies on a new king on the hardwood and has now proven its stripes on the astroturf with not one, but two L.A.-rooted NFL playoff teams. You also can't forget this past World Series which featured the LA Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox. As if history was bound to repeat itself once again, America is in the midst of its fifth Boston-LA. championship in the past 10 years. The only difference? This time around, the L.A. Rams, much like the other 30 teams in the NFL, have a pipe dream to dethrone the brilliant Brady-Belichick duo. For the third straight year, the New England Patriots surfaced as AFC Champions with hopes of one more win to notch the highest amount of Super Bowl wins in NFL history. While Brady insists that he'll continue on after this season, are we in the midst of the next great sports rivalry or just the passing of a torch? In reality, it's neither. Boston-L.A. rivalries are deeply rooted in disgust and hate in the forefront for fans. However, this Super Bowl doesn't feel like a rivalry. Frankly, it's just another team hoping to halt the freight train that Belichick and Brady continue to fuel. Yes, there have been successful teams along the way, such as Nick Foles and the 2018 Eagles, but Brady just keeps on trucking. In all honesty, I think Belichick threw that Super Bowl on purpose when he didn't play Malcolm Butler, but hey, that's just a conspiracy theory. Even when Brady loses, it doesn't really feel like a loss. He's been atop the league for the past eight seasons, so why is anyone surprised that the Patriots are here again? All year, analysts have doubted New England and disputed another Super Bowl appearance, yet, once again, here we are. Don't be fooled. This is no new rivalry. This is no passing of the torch. This is not the end of the Brady-Belichick dynasty. Win or lose, rain or shine, the Patriots will be back next year. There has never been another head coach-superstar duo like Brady-Belichick, and there won't be for years to come. While Sean McVay has dazzled in just two years at the helm, and Jared Goff has shown great promise and taken significant strides, be weary to label this as another Boston-L.A. rivalry. Boston has success rooted in gritty play and an uncompromising mindset that is unsatisfied without success. Los Angeles sports resemble entertainment instead of dedication and flashy play rather than tenacity. It's been a fun ride for the Rams, but better luck when Brady retires. The Patriots will take this one 31-27, as experience will once again prevail. A version of this article appeared on p. 8 of the Jan. 31, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Goff and Anderson's Golden Connection Goes to the Big Game,1-Feb-19,5:13 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-01/goff-and-andersons-golden-connection-goes-to-the-big-game/," † C.J. Anderson and Jared Goff will be playing in the Super Bowl this upcoming weekend in a matchup that will surely bring excitement to Cal fans all over the world as they will be the first Golden Bear backfields to play in the auspicious game, which no one would have predicted at the beginning of the year. For Goff, he entered the year on a loaded team that looked to build upon their successful season under first-year Head Coach Sean McVay. The Rams were able to add game-breaking players such as Brandin Cooks to help create more explosive plays to a team that was already leading the NFL in points per game. This led to Goff's best year as a pro with 32 touchdowns, 4,688 yards and a passer rating of 101.1, which were all career highs. Although some may attribute his success to McVay's unique playcalling, it is clear that Goff has hit his stride and will be one of the league's top quarterbacks for years to come. Anderson, on the other hand, had a very turbulent year as he started the season on the Carolina Panthers where he was second string to Christian McCaffrey. Because the offense was predicated on getting McCaffrey the ball in heavy doses, it was difficult for Anderson to get consistent touches. After coming off a year where he was a thousand-yard rusher, Anderson could have very easily requested a trade but instead he continued to be a good teammate, patiently waiting for his opportunity. Nine games into the season, he was released by the Panthers and immediately picked up by the Raiders after clearing waivers. Anderson did not play a game for the silver and black as he was promptly released for the second time on the season. With no one seeming to be interested in his services, he remained optimistic that the right team would come along, allowing him to prove his worth in the league. Three weeks later ""î after the Rams suffered their second straight loss to the Philadelphia Eagles as well as Todd Gurley re-injuring his knee ""î the Rams were in desperate need of not only a backup running up, but also a spark for their offense. They would sign Anderson for the rest of the season as Gurley would take the next two games off to rest his knee and get healthy for their playoff push. In the last two games of the regular season, Anderson had an average of 145 yards per game along with two touchdowns. His performance not only took pressure off of Goff but also gave the team some much-needed momentum heading into the playoffs. The narrative remained the same for the Rams in both of their playoff games as Anderson led the team in carries with Gurley still not fully recovered. By having a consistent running attack, the offense was much more effective as it allowed Goff to find holes in opposing defenses through play action. In their respective careers as Golden Bears, they did not win many games, which makes this game symbolic to Cal fans. With the fanbase starved of a league championship, a Super Bowl championship would mean the world to them behind an offense led by two Cal graduates. Just two days away from the big matchup, many analysts are starting to make their predictions for the players that will have the biggest impact. One thing for certain is that in order for the Rams to beat the Patriots, they will need Goff and Anderson to continue playing at a high level.

sports,Keys to the Big Game,1-Feb-19,5:15 AM,"['Richard Benites', 'Jake Ciccone']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-01/keys-to-the-big-game/," † Super Bowl LIII X-Factors New England Patriots Offense ""ì Julian Edelman After missing the first four weeks of the NFL season due to suspension, Tom Brady's favorite target has been as reliable as ever ""î and crucial to New England's playoff aspirations. Now in his 10th professional season, Patriots' wide receiver Julian Edelman will once again be lining up at the slot position for what will be his fourth Super Bowl appearance. In 2018, Edelman finished with 850 receiving yards and six touchdowns on 74 receptions. Although he is a very productive receiver, he's made a name for himself from his playoff performances. Able to beat the opposing secondary with his elusiveness and incredible catch radius, Edelman has often been compared to past New England greats like Wes Welker. Therefore, if it's crunch time and the Patriots need a clutch catch, they'd need to look no further than Edelman, considering he's at his best when under pressure or when his team is looking for its sixth Super Bowl win. Defense ""ì Stephon Gilmore After Super Bowl XLIX hero Malcolm Butler left last offseason, many questions began to arise about New England's depth at the cornerback position. This didn't last long, however, as critics began to realize that Stephon Gilmore was going to fill in just fine with his new role. Gilmore will be entering Super Bowl LIII with a total of 22 passes defended and three interceptions to his name. Not too shabby of a stat line ""î but his importance to the Patriots' secondary is amplified once it's realized that quarterbacks didn't throw in his direction often for a reason. In 2018, Gilmore was ranked as Pro Football Focus's No. 1 cornerback in the league with a positional grade of 90.9, as he allowed only 42 catches in 90 targets toward opposing wide receivers. Going up against a very versatile Rams receiving corps, Gilmore's ability to shut down whoever lines up against him won't go unnoticed. Los Angeles Rams Offense ""ì Todd Gurley After a fairly silent performance in the NFC Championship game against the New Orleans Saints, it'll be in Bill Belichick's best interests to not take No. 30, for the Rams, for granted. Arguably the best running back in the game today, Los Angeles's Todd Gurley will make his presence be felt once again on football's biggest stage. Whether it's a handoff out the backfield or in the passing game, Gurley is known for his ability to extend the play. Finishing as the league's rushing touchdown leader with a total of 17, Gurley also added 1,251 rushing yards, 580 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns to his impressive stat line on the season. Altogether, Gurley brings another explosive dimension of play to Head Coach Sean McVay's exciting offensive scheme, and he'll certainly be the x-factor combating New England's defensive plans. Defense ""ì Aaron Donald As past Super Bowls have shown, defense wins championships. Therefore, going up against an offensive line that protects football's greatest quarterback should be a dream scenario for the league's best pass rusher in Aaron Donald. Aaron Donald, like many other great pass rushers, tends to have two players simultaneously guarding him at all times. However, what separates the Rams' defensive star from the rest is that even if opponents assign a third player to mark him, it still might not be enough to halt his production. After being voted as the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, Donald will make his case for back-to-back honors with another outstanding stat line of 20.5 sacks, four forced fumbles and 25 tackles for loss in 2018. Aaron Donald's fast hands, excellent play-reading intelligence and overall brute strength are only some of the reasons why he's pretty much unstoppable; he'll be a pleasure to watch for all football fans in Super Bowl LIII. How the Run Game Will Impact Super Bowl LIII The 2018 NFL season has shined a bright light on the running back position with several high-profile backs going down for various reasons just to have their backups put up big rushing numbers in their place. Some players, like James Conner of Pittsburgh and Damien Williams of Kansas City, were able to jump right into a system where they could thrive despite their roles as replacements for other elite players. This has been evident in the Los Angeles Rams, who signed C.J. Anderson off his couch in Week 16 in replacement of the injured Todd Gurley. Anderson bowled his way to 120+ yards in each of his first three games for L.A. while also adding four touchdowns. Gurley has suffered from a number of mysterious injuries over the past month or so, and it was clear that the Rams did not feel like he was ready to play in the NFC title game, where Gurley only had four carries for 10 total yards. In the Rams' last four games, Gurley has had more than 50 yards in only one of those games. But that performance came in their most convincing win of that stretch, a win over the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round where Gurley was able to go off for 115 yards and a TD. Anderson is a serviceable running back, but he has nowhere near the athleticism and ability that Gurley has, and that is why when Gurley plays at full strength the Rams are able to raise their ceiling as a team.. Another reason why the Rams need last year's NFL MVP to be ready to perform on Super Bowl Sunday is because Bill Belichick is arguably the greatest NFL head coach of all time. He and his staff can take an inferior running back like Anderson out of the game and force a young QB like Jared Goff to beat them with his arm. In their AFC Championship win over the Chiefs, the Patriots were able to subdue the best offense in the NFL and shut them out for an entire half, which gave them a chance to take an early advantage. Belichick has shown time and time again that he can orchestrate a successful game plan even against the generational talents. But the Rams definitely feel confident with head coach Sean McVay roaming the sidelines, as he is arguably the second-best coach in the NFL behind Belichick. In that divisional conference playoff match-up with the Cowboys, the Rams ran for a total of 273 yards compared to only 50 for Dallas. One reason why coach McVay has run the ball so much is how running plays eat up time of possession. LA had more than 50 percent more possession than the Cowboys in that game. In the NFC conference championship against the New Orleans Saints, the Rams rush yards dropped drastically to 77 yards and their time of possession was cut drastically. They were never really able to gain an offensive rythmn because of this, which is part of the reason that the game was so close. If coach McVay has a healthy Gurley on his side, he can force the Patriots' coaching staff to make some difficult decisions on whether they want to put an emphasis on stopping the Rams' dangerous receiving core or Gurley out of the backfield. The Rams' coaching and medical staff have been relatively quiet when it comes to the status of Gurley for Sunday's game, and his recovery will be a major factor in how the game is played on both sides. Even if he doesn't play his usual amount of snaps, expect the winner of the rushing battle to ultimately have a huge advantage.

sports,Brady Poised To Take His Place as the Greatest of All Time,2-Feb-19,5:33 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-02/brady-poised-to-take-his-place-as-the-greatest-of-all-time/," † New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is one of the most polarizing and successful figures in the history of the NFL. Since Week 2 of the 2001 NFL season when Patriots starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe was injured, forcing Brady into the game, he has dominated the league at unprecedented levels. Brady's road to superstardom wasn't easy, however. In fact, it almost never existed at all. After playing back-up quarterback for his first two years at the University of Michigan, he took over as starter for the Wolverines right before the 1998 season and played out his last two years as the leader of the team. Brady broke a few school passing records in the process and eventually built up a solid resume going into the 2000 NFL Draft. However, even in a uniquely weak draft for quarterbacks (Chad Pennington was the first QB to be selected at 18), Brady's subpar combind showing dropped him all the way to the sixth round, during which he was selected by the Patriots as the 199th pick. The Pats already had a solid starting quarterback in Drew Bledsoe, and as a late pick in the draft Brady actually entered his rookie season at fourth on the team depth chart. By the end of the season he had only thrown one completion, but his strong work ethic and effort with the practice squad propelled him into the back-up spot. When Bledsoe took a huge hit from Jet's linebacker Mo Lewis in the second week of the 2001 season, which put him in the hospital, it was time for Brady to take over. After a shaky couple games to start off, Brady eventually went on a tear. The Patriots ended their season on a six-game win streak and earned a bye week going into the playoffs, Tom Brady earned a Pro Bowl nod for the next season and he ultimately led the Pats to their first Super Bowl win in franchise history. From that point on, the New England Patriots and Tom Brady have been the dominant force in the NFL all the way until now. In his 19th season, Brady holds a smorgasbord of NFL records, including: most regular season wins (207), most passing touchdowns (590), most playoff wins (29), most Super Bowl wins (5) and many more. It didn't seem as if the Patriots had that same magic to start off the 2018-19 season, however. Fresh off a Super Bowl loss to the Eagles, a slow start (including two early losses to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Detroit Lions) brought the doubters out of the woodwork, and as much of the glory is usually bestowed upon Brady, a lot of the hate was pushed upon him as well. Analysts on SportsCenter gave the Patriots a zero percent chance to make it back to the championship game, and narratives around Tom Brady's old age being a factor started to surface. These narratives actually haven't gone away, with Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman just last week claiming that Brady might be too old to lead the team to another ring. ""úAge has definitely taken a toll,""ù Robey-Coleman said to Bleacher Report. ""úFor him to still be doing it, that's a great compliment for him. But I think that he's definitely not the same quarterback he was.""ù Brady would probably beg to differ, and a six-game win streak in the middle of the season this year seems to refute that claim as well. He averaged around 308 passing yards and two touchdowns per game during that stretch and ultimately ended around the middle of the pack in those two categories by the end of the season. The Patriots came into the postseason at the top of their division and in second place in the AFC, and they steamrolled over the Los Angeles Chargers 41-28 in their first playoff game. Brady threw for 343 yards and one touchdown with a 106 QBR in the game, setting up a matchup with sophomore phenom Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the conference championship. This game had the potential to fulfill all the negative prophecies about Brady. Mahomes was a young quarterback seemingly poised to take his spot, the Chiefs defense had been forcing crucial turnovers all season and the Patriots had only been tested in the first round by the worst team in the playoffs. After a tightly contested four quarters it all came down to a final drive in overtime, and yet again Brady marched the Pats down the field and turned in another clutch performance to score a touchdown and push his squad into the Super Bowl. Tom Brady's legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time is already set in stone ""î his five rings make that clear. But if he leads the Patriots to a Super Bowl victory over the Rams on Sunday afternoon, it will be hard to say that he doesn't belong in a category all to himself.

sports,"Heidegger, Sow Come Up Big in 75-54 Rout of Hawai'i",3-Feb-19,2:51 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-03/heidegger-sow-come-up-big-in-75-54-rout-of-hawaii/," In the midst of its most difficult stretch of the season, the UC Santa Barbara Men's Basketball team bounced back with a 75-54 blowout over the Rainbow Warriors of Hawaii to improve to 16-5 overall this season with a 5-2 record in the Big West Conference. The Gauchos fed off the persistence of freshman forward Amadou Sow who had 20 points and tied a career-high 11 rebounds for his second career double-double. Sow shot 9-15 from the field for his fourth 60 percent performance in the past five games. How about a coming out party for junior Max Heidegger? This was Heidegger's game of the year with 20 points on 5-9 shooting including three of five from deep. The 2018 first-team All-Big West guard was a perfect 7-7 from the stripe and added three rebounds and three assists without a turnover in his 30 minutes on the floor. Santa Barbara went blow for blow with the Rainbow Warriors through the first 13 minutes of the first half before graduate guard Armond Davis fed Amadou Sow a pass in the restricted area for him to muscle in with a right-handed hook to take a 19-18 lead. Heidegger tagged along on the ensuing possession on a drive from the far baseline to draw contact at the rack and get the bucket to go while falling to the floor. Of the final 11 points scored in the first half, Heidegger accounted for eight of them while accruing two separate three-point plays off of fouls from juniors Eddie Stansberry and Zigmars Raimo to put UCSB on top 30-26 heading into the break. Stansberry is tenth in the Big West in scoring efficiency with 12.7 points per game, but only managed to score six against the Gauchos with a pair of three-pointers. Raimo, on the other hand, knocks down a second-best 57.6 percent from the field, but shot well under that tonight going 4-9 with 10 points and four rebounds. Coming out of the break, Santa Barbara broke away with eight straight points in the paint including a spiral finish from Amadou Sow against Raimo from the left block before the senior forward tip-toed the right baseline for an up-and-under finish. The Gauchos preceded to go on a 16 to nothing tear as Davis and Sow contributed for five and six points respectively over the four-minute frame to put UCSB in the lead 54-33 with 9:54 on the clock. Heidegger followed suit with 12 of the next 13 points to close this one out for the Gauchos with a monster 21-point win over fourth ranked Hawaii who falls to 13-7, 4-3 in conference play following just their third loss at home this season. The win for SB consisted of productive and efficient shooting throughout the night including 65.4% of field goals in the second half. Hawaii struggled from the field shooting 38% for the game while connecting on just 5-22 from beyond the arc. The win comes after a nail biter that fell through the cracks as No. 1 UC Irvine handed UCSB its first home loss of the season in the Thunderdome as the ""òChos fell 66-62 in overtime. Irvine came out on top after an off-shooting night for Santa Barbara who hit just 33% of their attempts from the field in a loss to the best defensive team they've faced all season. It was graduate forward Jonathan Galloway and junior Tommy Rutherford that bullied the Gauchos in the paint with a combined 17 rebounds and five blocks while Rutherford supplied 11 points and Galloway added nine on 4-6 shooting. Collin Welp was unstoppable in the first half with 10 of his 12 total points off the bench, but it was redshirt junior who came away with eight of Irvine's 10 overtime points to secure the victory and first place for the Anteaters. Following a split over the weekend, Santa Barbara will host Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, February 6 at 7 p.m. before UC Davis comes to town on Saturday, February 9 for a 9 p.m. tip-off time in the Thunderdome broadcast on ESPNU.

sports,Gauchos Continue Four-Game Skid With Loss to UCR,4-Feb-19,5:26 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-04/gauchos-continue-four-game-skid-with-loss-to-ucr/," The UCSB women's basketball team dropped their fourth straight game on Saturday, falling to UC Riverside 73-60.  With the loss, Santa Barbara slumps to 4-16 on the season, including a 1-6 record in conference play. Tied in last place with Cal Poly in the Big West, the Gauchos will now need to finish the season strong if they hope to qualify for the conference tournament. Once again, a slow start proved to be fatal for Santa Barbara. In the entire first quarter, UCSB only scored three points ""î their lowest point total in any individual quarter this season. To Riverside's credit, they came in with a clear game plan: stop junior center Natalia Bruening and force the Gauchos to hit their outside shots. In that first quarter, Santa Barbara only made one of their eight three-pointers, while Bruening missed both of her shots. The Highlanders impressively kept Bruening almost entirely off the scoresheet during the game, with her sole contribution being one defensive rebound. Without Bruening's presence inside, the Gauchos were forced to heave up low percentage shots all game. Guard Danae Miller shot 3-15 from the floor, while junior Coco Miller ""î UCSB's leading scorer on the season ""î shot an inefficient 1-12 from the field. Santa Barbara also struggled to contain UC Riverside, especially in the second half. The Highlanders scored 42 of their 73 points in the second half, with 26 of those points coming in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. With 40 of their 73 points coming in the paint, Riverside was able to manufacture high-percentage shots all night. Senior guard Jannon Otto led all scorers on Saturday with 26 points on an impressive 77 percent shooting, while fellow senior Malou De Kergret chipped in 20 points for Riverside. All 73 of the Highlander's points came from their starters, with their bench only logging a combined seven minutes on Saturday. With the win, UC Riverside now jumps into fourth place with their 4-3 conference record, and has won four of their last five games after starting conference play 0-2. While there have been few positives for the Gauchos as of late, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson will be pleased with the resurgent play from the bench on Saturday.  With Bruening struggling, first-year center Megan Ormiston played arguably her best game of the season, scoring 10 points while also grabbing eight rebounds ""î seven of which came on the offensive glass. Junior guard Tal Sahar also provided the Gauchos with some offensive firepower from the bench, leading the team with 18 points while also notching a double-double by grabbing 10 boards. For a player that has struggled with her shot much of the year, Sahar shot 50 percent from the floor on Saturday, pacing the Gauchos with her four three pointers. Still, moral victories can only go so far in sports. While Henrickson and the team staff knew this would be a rebuilding year, the team's 4-16 record doesn't look pretty on paper. Things won't get any easier this week, when first place UC Davis comes to town on Thursday. With a 7-1 overall conference record and on a six game win streak, Davis will prove to be a handful for a struggling Gauchos squad. On the bright side, Santa Barbara has nowhere to go but up at this point in the season. With a resilient squad that continues to fight hard every game, look for the Gauchos to bounce back in the second half of the season.

sports,Gauchos Host CSUN and UC Davis in This Week's Big West Doubleheader,6-Feb-19,2:36 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-06/gauchos-host-csun-and-uc-davis-in-this-weeks-big-west-doubleheader/," Following this week of matchups the regular season of conference play will have reached its halfway mark for the Gauchos, as the men's basketball team is set to host Big West opponents CSUN and UC Davis. UCSB will stay at home for this week's conference double header, as it first welcomes the CSUN Matadors on Wednesday, then the UC Davis Aggies on Saturday. After splitting their pair of matches last week, with the former being a heartbreaking 66-62 overtime loss to UC Irvine at home and the latter an imposing 75-54 road win against Hawai'i, the Gauchos will be looking to continue their winning ways through this week's Big West doubleheader. As the team's impressive season ensues, UCSB currently stands at an overall record of 16-5; with at least 10 guaranteed games left this year, this performance is on a record-breaking pace considering 23 wins in a single season is the best finish the men's basketball program has ever had. Following the most recent loss to UC Irvine, the Gauchos are unfortunately no longer undefeated at home. However, UCSB's 9-1 home record still demands respect from opponents as the team looks to successfully defend the Thunderdome through this week. Wednesday's opponent, CSUN, will want to flip the script as the Matadors inch closer and closer to a .500 win percentage. On the season, CSUN maintain an overall record of 10-13; with their away record standing at 3-6. Entering this one, the Matadors will be coming off a most recent home win against Cal Poly, which resulted in a final result of 83-65. CSUN is, historically, a familiar foe for UCSB, as this week's confrontation is soon to be the 57th time that these two sides have ever faced off; the Gauchos hold the advantage, however, in the all-time series with a 37-19 record. As for UC Davis, the Aggies' situation hasn't been quite as kind. On the season, UC Davis barely reaches the .300 win percentage mark, as the team find themselves at an overall record of 6-14. With a decent home record of 4-3, the Aggies can blame their struggles on their consistently poor road performances; UC Davis' away record currently stands at a 1-10 on the season. With a favorable Cal Poly matchup on Thursday, before they meet with UCSB on Saturday, the Aggies might be in inspirational form considering they're coming off a most recent 84-71 win over UC Riverside. Historically, this will be the 39th time that this side has faced the Gauchos; UCSB also leads the all-time series record in this one, with a 29-9 advantage. For this week's conference doubleheader, a player to watch for the Gauchos would be freshman forward Amadou Sow. After tying for a game-leading 20 points, Sow also added 11 rebounds to his name during his spectacular performance against Hawai'i. Junior guard Max Heidegger was the other Gaucho to have scored 20 points that night and he'll be another player to watch considering his return to the starting five was alongside sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey; head coach Joe Pasternak's decision to start both of these guards is a scenario that should be closely monitored, as the two may simultaneously feature again this week. For the Matadors, one to watch would be sophomore guard Terrell Gomez. Leading his team in total minutes, Gomez plays a crucial role in CSUN's strategy. At 5'8""ù, Gomez runs his side's offense by averaging almost 20 points a game and earning the second most assists with 65 to his name. It's the TJ Shorts II show for UC Davis, as the senior guard takes on the role of scorer and playmaker for his side. Shorts II seemingly covers the entire court at times, considering that he leads the Aggies in scoring with 292 points, rebounds with 101, assists with 82, and in steals with 35; it's within the Gauchos' best interests to find a way to limit his game. A Big West update is in order, as UCSB continues their fight for that top of the table spot, as the team currently stands at second place in league standings with a conference record of 5-2; UC Irvine remains in first with their 7-1 conference record, whilst a game ahead of the Gauchos. Meanwhile, CSUN is the middlemost team in the standings, at 4-3, and UC Davis is in sixth place, at 2-4. UCSB is set to host this week's Big West action at the Thunderdome, starting with CSUN at 7 PM this Wednesday, February 6th, then against UC Davis at 9 PM on Saturday, February 9th.

With only the top eight teams in the conference eligible for postseason play, the Gauchos currently find themselves on the outside looking in. In their last game against UC Riverside ""î a 73-60 loss ""î the Gauchos once again struggled from the field, hitting only 33 percent of their shots on the night while allowing the Highlanders to shoot almost 50 percent. As has been the case all season, Santa Barbara just can't seem to find a rhythm on the offensive end. While the bench stepped up and scored 31 points on Saturday, UCSB's starters merely made 10 of their 41 field goals on the night. So far in conference play, the Gauchos have yet to have a game where their whole offense has been firing on all cylinders. Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, the sledding won't get any easier this week when UC Davis and Cal State Northridge come to town. The Aggies start the week with sole possession of first place in the conference after blowing out both Northridge and Long Beach State last week. With six straight wins and a 15-6 overall record, Davis is the last opponent a struggling Gauchos side wants to see on the schedule. Davis' dominant defense has been the key to their recent run of success; during their six game win streak, the Aggies have yet to allow more than 57 points in a game. Perhaps most impressively, UC Davis held an offensive-minded Fullerton squad to only 39 points two weeks ago. Offensively, everything Davis does runs through redshirt senior forward Morgan Bertsch. One of the most talented individual scorers in the conference, Bertsch currently ranks fourth in the entire country and leads the Big West with 23.6 ppg. Perhaps just as impressively, Bertsch has incredibly efficient shooting splits, shooting over 50 percent from the floor, 57 percent from deep and 83 percent from the free throw line.The 6'4 forward also contributes on the defensive end, leading Davis with almost 1.5 blocks per game and chipping in 5.7 rebounds per game. While the Gauchos have played relatively decent team defense all year ""î giving up only 67 points per game to opponents ""î they don't have a lockdown defender that will be able to take Bertsch. Junior center Natalia Bruening won't be quick enough to stop the shifty forward, while the rest of the team won't be big enough to get in her way. In lieu of that, look for Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson to double team whenever possible and force the other Aggies to step up. Outside of Bertsch, Davis relies on senior point guard Kourtney Eaton to facilitate the offense. The savvy guard is averaging 7.2 ppg, but leads the team with almost five assists per game and a 2:1 assist to turnover ratio. Things will get slightly easier for UCSB on Saturday when Cal State Northridge comes to the Thunderdome. CSUN currently sits in third place in the conference, although they only sport an 11-11 overall record on the season. In the first conference matchup between these teams earlier this season, UCSB fell behind big early, but made a late run to come within eight of Northridge. Similarly to the Aggies, Northridge relies on its big for the bulk of its production. Stud senior center Channon Fluker ""î the conference player of the year last season ""î has produced another outstanding season for the Matadors, leading the team with 15.2 ppg and a resounding 10.8 rebounds per game. In the first matchup between these teams, Fluker proved to be the difference, grabbing a game-high 14 rebounds to go along with 17 points. Outside of Fluker, however, the Matador's offensive has been ineffective, with the team only averaging 60 points per game on the season. Like Santa Barbara, Northridge struggles to stretch the floor, shooting less than 30 percent from beyond the arc. Unfortunately, none of that will matter if Santa Barbara can't get their shots to fall on Saturday. With UCSB shooting 35 percent from the field and 25 percent from deep, a strong defensive effort can only go so far. Junior guard Coco Miller ""î who leads the Gauchos with 13.5 ppg ""î has been in a shooting slump of late, making only six of her last 42 field goal attempts. Without Miller stretching the floor, defenses have been able to key in on Bruening, with Riverside keeping her scoreless in her 14 minutes on the floor. In Big West play, anything is possible, especially at home. Still, UCSB will need to be hitting their shots this week if they hope to crawl out of last place in the conference.

sports,Max Heidegger Leads Gauchos to Solid Win Over CSUN,7-Feb-19,5:05 AM,"['Omar Hernandez', 'Brandon Victor']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/max-heidegger-leads-gauchos-to-solid-win-over-csun/,"Max Heidegger reaches past the defense toward the hoop. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus Behind a huge 26-point performance by star junior guard Max Heidegger, the UCSB men's basketball team took down the CSUN Matadors 70-64. With the win, UCSB rose to a 6-2 conference, 17-5 overall record and solidified its second place standing in the Big West. The Matadors dropped to a 4-4 conference, 10-14 overall record on the year and stayed put at fifth place in the conference standing. The Gauchos actually struggled out of the gate, turning the ball over on three of their first four possessions. In total, UCSB had 11 turnovers in the first half, leading to 12 points for CSUN. ""úWe had a slow start, which is unacceptable,""ù freshman forward Amadou Sow pointed out postgame. ""úWe came out slow, and let them do whatever they wanted to do.""ù Due to Santa Barbara's uncharacteristic sloppiness on the offensive end, the Matadors jumped out to a quick 11-0 lead, with freshman phenom Lamine Diane ""î a Senegalese forward who leads the Big West with 24.1 ppg ""î pacing the team with nine of the 11 points. As has been the case all season, CSUN looked to feed Diane early and often on Wednesday. In the first half, Diane led all scorers with 17 points on an efficient 73 percent shooting from the floor, and he eventually finished with a game-high 28. With the undersized Gauchos unable to match up with the lanky forward, Head Coach Joe Pasternack was forced to bring junior forward Jarriesse Blackmon on to try to limit Diane. Despite this slow start, the Gauchos were able to claw their way back into the game, tying the game at 28 with 1:24 left in the half. UCSB leaned on the resurgent play of Heidegger, who led the Gauchos with nine points in the half ""î including a handful of tough finishes in the paint. After weathering CSUN's torrid start to the game, Santa Barbara only found itself down one point at the half, 29-28. The Gauchos started off the second half with an aggressive mindset. Defensively, one of the big changes that Pasternack made was doubling Diane and forcing other players to beat UCSB. This led to a bunch of contested three pointers for CSUN in the second half as the Matadors played right into the Gaucho's hands, ending the game 1-21 from beyond the arc. Heidegger ignited the UCSB offense in the second half. He had yet to have a signature performance since he came back from the leg injury which kept him out for a good part of the non-conference schedule, but as the game went on it became clear that he's back to his previous form.  ""úWhen you take three months off and you do nothing you're not just gonna show up and be who you were last year,""ù Pasternack explained when asked about Heidegger's performance. ""úBut he's honored the process extremely well and done an amazing job, and he's just getting back to who he is""¶ I'm just so happy and proud of him.""ù The guard had 17 points on 3-6 shooting from three in the second half, and consistently knocked down big shot after big shot right when the Gauchos needed it. He made a deep wing three with two minutes to go in the game to put UCSB up 64-58 and the team never looked back, eventually getting the 70-64 win. The Gauchos are now looking to put together their second three-game win streak of the year as they get set to host UC Davis on Saturday night. With their sights set on first-place in the Big West, the team knows that they can't take a slumping Aggie team lightly. ""úRight now [UC Davis] is the conference champion and they have TJ Shorts the reigning player of the year,""ù Pasternack said. ""úLast time we played them at home they beat us very bad""¶ it'll be a battle just like tonight.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 7, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus

sports,No. 6 UCSB Puts 6-Match Win Streak on the Line at AVCA Showcase,7-Feb-19,5:45 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/no-6-ucsb-puts-6-match-win-streak-on-the-line-at-avca-showcase/," In college volleyball, the talk has been dominated by the top three teams in the country, all of whom reside in the Big West Conference: No. 1 (and reigning champs) Long Beach State, No. 2 Hawaii and No. 3 UC Irvine.  But after six straight victories, five of which have come against ranked opponents, and a winning margin of 18-6 in those games, it appears it is time to give some attention to the UCSB men's volleyball team. The Gauchos currently boast a 9-3 record, their best 12-game start to a season since the 2007 campaign, during which they also started 9-3. That year, UCSB went 20-12 overall.  This week, the Gauchos will face off against two unranked opponents, Ohio State and Penn State, in the AVCA Showcase hosted by Long Beach State. Ohio State holds a below .500 mark at 4-6 while Penn State sits at an even 4-4. In its last week of play, Santa Barbara enjoyed great success. Last Friday and Saturday, the Gauchos pulled off two 3-0 wins against then No. 3 BYU.  The wins are what helped propel UCSB from No. 9 to No. 6 in the country while BYU fell to No. 7 behind the Gauchos, and with two more wins this weekend, it would become increasingly harder to ignore what Santa Barbara is doing. A great part of UCSB's success has been the play of outside hitters Corey Chavers and Ryan Wilcox. Both players have won a Big West Athlete of the Week award for the past two weeks, with Chavers winning Player of the Week and Wilcox winning Freshman of the Week.  The senior has come alive during this six-match winning streak, as he is averaging more than 18 kills per game and has tallied 13 service aces. In his first six matches of the season, Chavers only averaged 10.8 kills per match and had nine aces. In the BYU series, Chavers racked up 33 kills on an incredible 5.50 kills-per-set average while hitting .309. The Downey, Calif., native also added six service aces across the two matches, three in each. As for Wilcox, the freshman has stepped up his pace of play exceptionally in the last six games, having double-digit kills in three of them. Against BYU on Saturday, Wilcox set a new career high by tallying 14 kills on a very efficient .667 hitting percentage. He also had no errors in that match. In general, however, the entire Gaucho team has been playing at a consistently high level. In the last six matches, UCSB has averaged a hitting percentage .326 per game and has only had one match in which it didn't hit at least .300. Santa Barbara will definitely look to keep up this high level of play as it prepares to face off against two opponents it isn't too familiar with. Against Ohio State, UCSB leads the all-time series 7-2, but the two teams have not met since 2012, which saw the Buckeyes get the win. OSU recently lost 3-0 to Purdue Fort Wayne, a team UCSB defeated 3-1 on the road. Some of the key players on Ohio State are redshirt sophomore outside hitter Jake Hanes and senior setter Sanil Thomas.  Hanes currently leads the team in kills with 133, while Thomas is not just the best setter on his team but also one of the best in the country, as he averages 10.24 assists per match (which is the eighth best mark in the country). As for Penn State, the Gauchos also lead the all-time series 8-7 but have not defeated the Nittany Lions since 2010. When the two teams met back in 2017, Penn State, at home, bested UCSB 3-1.  In terms of this season, PSU has struggled against common opponents UCSB has faced, going a combined 0-3 with losses against BYU, Lewis and Loyola-Chicago. Penn State also lost to Ohio State 3-1 in its season opener.  Offensively, the Nittany Lions have a slew of offensive options, as their top three players each have over 60 kills apiece. Redshirt senior Matthew McLaren leads the team with 68 kills while teammate Jason Donorovich is one behind with 67. Donorovich also leads the team with 33 blocks and in service aces with 12. Overall, UCSB is presented with a great opportunity this weekend. To win eight straight would be a huge accomplishment, especially considering that it would give the Gauchos 11 wins on the year, matching their entire total from last season. The important thing for Santa Barbara is to stay on its toes and keep the pressure on. This will be the last weekend before conference play starts for the 'Chos, so keeping momentum is a top priority. UCSB will take on Ohio State at 6 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 8, at the Walter Pyramid Arena and Penn State on Saturday, Feb. 9, at the same time and location.

sports,Patriots Take Home the Lombardi Trophy Once Again,7-Feb-19,1:15 PM,['Nate Zicherman'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-07/patriots-take-home-the-lombardi-trophy-once-again/," Here we go again. There are few certainties in life: death, taxes, and another Patriots Super Bowl. Seventeen years after the inception of the dynasty that would bring the NFL to heel, it still just seems like the same old Patriots ""î the same cold, emotionless gaze from Bill Belichick, the same giddy excitement from Tom Brady and the same recycled victory speech from Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Despite the view fatigue, averaging more than one Super Bowl victory every three years for nearly two decades is an incredible feat to witness. However, somewhere along the line, the NFL's fans became wary of what the Patriots have been doing. Although for many Patriot fans this empire seems to be the confluence of everything they've convinced themselves that they deserve, others (let's just call them ""úthe vast majority""ù) feel this New England victory is just the latest scene in a tale that will rival the tragedies of Shakespeare and ancient Greece. The first Patriot Super Bowl win, nearly two decades ago, came against the very same team they just soundly defeated, the Rams. Unsurprisingly, Tom Brady is the only player left from either of those two Super Bowl teams who is still playing in the NFL today (excluding the ageless wonder of Adam Vinatieri, who now plays for the Indianapolis Colts). A lot has happened since then. The NFL became a passing league, in part due to the unprecedented offensive success of the team the Patriots had just beaten, the ""úGreatest Show on Turf""ù Rams. During that time the Patriots built a new stadium, the Rams moved back to Los Angeles, and Bill Belichick and Tom Brady became the two most successful men in the history of the NFL's playoffs. At the outset of this regime, the Patriots team strongly resembled the one we just watched win the Super Bowl ""îdefensive teams built around playing mistake-free football that can force turnovers, possessing the football, and running the clock. The Belichick Special. This slowly evolved into the Patriots we've come to know. History will always first recall the shootouts and late-game comebacks Brady has been canonized for ""î as it should. But the first three Patriots Super Bowl victories all came on the execution of prepared defenses and a running game that considerably outgained each Super Bowl opponent.† Brady himself was measurably outplayed by Donavan Mcnabb and Kurt Warner during these games and was very nearly outclassed by Jake Delhomme. After a brief 10 year hiatus from Super Bowl victory, highlighted by two Super Bowl losses to the New York Giants, the Patriots would make it back to the promised land but this time with new philosophies. The NFL had been changing and the Patriots, as always, were ready to adapt. Belichick's Patriots teams have always looked to abuse their opponents' most glaring weaknesses in every game they play. So as the league made defending the pass harder and harder, the Patriots began throwing more and more. During this decade Brady would become the quarterback we all know him as today. The Patriots would soon go on to draft one of the most dominant Tight Ends of all time in Robert Gronkowski. They would hire a new offensive coordinator by the name of Josh McDaniels, and they would light NFL defenses up like Christmas trees, allowing Brady to pick up three MVP awards along the way. So after two of the most thrilling victories in the history of the Super Bowl, coming against the Seahawks and Falcons in Super Bowls 49 and 51, Brady was crowned and hailed the greatest of all time. Another monstrous record-breaking passing performance, in which he threw for 505 yards against the Eagles in a losing effort, seemed to cement Brady's place in the hearts and minds of all those who watch football as the greatest pure passer to ever do it. However, this year was something different entirely. From the outset of the season, the talking point on the Patriots was that they don't look the same. Brady wasn't playing near an MVP level for the first time since 2006. After years of being considered one of the toughest players in the league and taking all the abuse that comes with it, Gronkowski appeared a shell of his former self. Even the defense and special teams units, which Belichick has always been able to keep more than functional, looked slow sideline to sideline and unable to execute consistently. So the talk swirled once again but this time louder than ever before: ""úIs this it for Brady and Belichick? Could the patriots dynasty be coming to an end?""ù Then Super Bowl LII happened. This game was a slow motion automobile collision of a football game (from an entertainment standpoint). However, for more serious followers of the NFL, it illuminated what for many was a horrid truth. The Patriots aren't done yet. With Brady putting out what is statistically the worst game he's had since his first meeting with the Rams in the Super Bowl, it was also somehow the Patriots' most dominant performance in any of their Super Bowls. Brady threw for the least yards since their first championship showdown with the Rams and, for the first time in his Super Bowl career, failed to throw a touchdown pass. Despite this objectively poor performance from Brady, the Patriots managed to win the first Super Bowl in which they were not trailing once in the entire game. Tom Brady didn't win them this game, and Julian Edelman didn't win it for them either, despite his being awarded the SBMVP. This game was won by the defense and the offensive line, which kept Brady as protected as any QB in postseason history. Most importantly, this game was won by their unshakable run-game, spearheaded by Sony Michel and James Develin. The Patriots rushed for 154 yards to the Rams' 62. Running primarily out of the I-formation, the Patriots took it back to the old school. They ran north and south all postseason, beating up on lighter more modern defenses built to play side-to-side. This was the first season since they beat the Eagles in 2005 that Brady needed his team to cover for his shortcomings, and for the first time since 2005 they were able to employ that coverage. The first time around, a youthful Brady's lack of preparation and experience allowed the rest of his team win their first Super Bowl. Now we see a Patriot team that looks similar to the olden days†""î only this team exists with the distinction of being led by a Tom Brady who makes up for the attritions of his war against father time with what is, at this point, an unmatched level of experience and regiment of preparation. We all know that father time is undefeated, and despite his illustrious career, even Tom Brady is not going to be the first athlete to defeat him. Soon enough he'll have to hang ""òem up and ride off into the sunset, but now, as we enter the third and final act of the Patriots dynasty, only one question remains: If the Patriots keep end up playing inexperienced teams ""îteams coached and quarterbacked by men without a fraction of the playoff experience had by either Brady or Belichick, ones who freeze in the spotlight, like we just saw McVay and Goff do ""î how many more rings could the Patriots and a game-managing Tom Brady rack up?

sports,No. 6 UCSB Steamrolls Ohio State at AVCA Showcase For 7th Straight Win,8-Feb-19,7:53 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-08/no-6-ucsb-steamrolls-ohio-state-at-avca-showcase-for-7th-straight-win/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus From start to finish, the No. 6 UCSB men's volleyball team was playing with some major confidence when it took the court on Friday night against unranked Ohio State leading to a 3-0 win over the Buckeyes†with set scores of 25-22, 25-22, 25-12 at the AVCA Showcase for its seventh consecutive victory. This also marks the third-straight match the Gauchos have won in a sweep. ""úFun to play a top program from the MIVA. Guys started a little slow from the device line but improved as the match went on. We will have to play better tomorrow to beat the top team from the EIVA,""ù Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said. With its seventh straight win, UCSB is now 10-3 on the year and is one victory away from matching its total win count from last season. Ohio State drops to 4-7 on the year and has now lost four of its last five contests. OSU's next match is against No. 1 LBSU. Overall, the Gauchos looked just as impressive Friday evening as it has the last few weeks. In total, UCSB had an impressive .423 hitting percentage on the night while holding Ohio State well below its season average as it just tallied a .107 hitting percentage. UCSB's .423 hitting percentage is the third highest total it has earned in a match. Furthermore, Santa Barbara had 13 fewer attacks than Ohio State but seven more total kills. Still, in the first set, the Buckeyes came out strong matching the Gauchos point for point early on and eventually stretching a four-point lead at 15-11 thanks to a few UCSB errors. Santa Barbara battled back to eventually tie the match at 21-21. Junior opposite Keenan Sanders then broke the tie with a kill and, with his team up 24-22, clinched the first set with another kill. Sanders played probably his most efficient game all season totaling nine kills on just 10 total attacks with no errors. In total, UCSB had 13 kills in the first. In the second set, much of the same continued from the first with both teams continuing to trade points throughout. With the match tied at 10-10, however, the Gauchos won 10 of the next 15 points to take a commanding†20-15 lead. Looking to get back into the match, Ohio State's junior outside hitter Reese Devilbiss tallied two straight kills and, following a UCSB service error, the Buckeyes were within two at 20-18. Devilbiss had nine kills on the night, the most of any Buckeye. With the lead dwindling, UCSB's star outside hitter Corey Chavers would go onto seal the match earning three kills in the Gauchos last five points to help UCSB seal another 25-22 set win. On the night, Chavers would finish with a game-high 10 kills and on a very impressive .381 hitting percentage. Up 2-0 with just one more set win to seal the match, UCSB came out strong. Tied at 5-5, the Gauchos put together a 12-4 run to take a 17-9 lead with multiple Gauchos earning their fair share of kills. From there, UCSB coasted and earned the 25-12 set win to take the match 3-0. Aside from dominating†on the offensive end, the Gauchos also had 26 team digs with redshirt senior Hayden Boehle having a game-high 10 digs. Additionally, UCSB tallied 6.5 blocks compared to just one for the Buckeyes. Setter†Randy DeWeese also had a solid outing racking up 30 assists, the fifth time in the last six matches the junior has had 30 or more assists in a game. Following yet another 3-0 win there is no doubt that UCSB is playing with all-time high confidence. Seven straight wins speak for themselves, but the fact that Santa Barbara is doing this not just at home but also on the road and against impressive powerhouse programs seem to bode well for this programs championship hopes this season. Still, the Gauchos have a long way to go if they want to beat the top teams not just in this country but in their own conference. Seven wins might be enough for some coaches. Not McLaughlin. ""úEight would feel better,""ù McLaughlin said. UCSB will take on Penn State at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 9 at the Walter Pyramid Arena to conclude the AVCA Showcase.

sports,Miller Guides Gauchos to Second Conference Win,10-Feb-19,11:47 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-10/miller-guides-gauchos-to-second-conference-win/,"† Coco Miller starts a layup, having quickly pushed down the court after a steal. Eric Swenson / Daily Nexus With a thrilling 61-60 victory against Cal State Northridge, the UCSB women's basketball team was able to snap its five-game losing streak, putting it at an overall record of 5-17 (2-7 in conference play).  The game would go back and forth early as both teams were able to score fairly easily. For Santa Barbara, junior guard Coco Miller got off to a quick start as she scored six of her team-high 17 points in the first quarter. 

One of the issues for the Gauchos has been their inability to find consistency on the offensive end of the floor. As the young squad still tries to find their identity, it would be crucial for them to keep the game close, as they have shown they are unable to come back from large deficits.  Heading into the second quarter, the ""òChos found themselves down one as senior center Channon Fluker paced the Matadors early with five points and five rebounds. She was also able to make an impact on the defensive end with consistent rim protection as well. It was a stalemate in the second, with both teams unable to create any separation from the other. Junior center Natalia Bruening would score five straight points to the start the quarter but would have to sit for most of the period due to foul trouble. Guard Danae Miller for the ""òChos struggled mightily in the first half as she was 0 for 3 from the field, along with four turnovers.  For Santa Barbara to come away with the win, they would need both Millers to make more of an impact offensively while also providing veteran leadership. CSUN was able to add to its one-point lead in the third quarter behind strong play from Fluker and freshman guard Jordyn Jackson. Fluker showed off her consistent mid-range game as she scored 11 of the matador's 16 points in the period. UCSB found itself down six with just a minute left in the fourth quarter but would end up going on a final push to secure the win. Coco Miller was able to knock down a three-pointer to make it a three-point game and, after a turnover on CSUN's next possession, Danae Miller was able to hit a clutch three-point shot to tie the game with 49 seconds left in the final period.  Following another turnover by the Matadors, Santa Barbara looked to run down the clock and go for the win. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom was fouled with just eight seconds left and headed to the free-throw line. Despite missing the first, she was able to make the second, giving the Gauchos a one-point lead.  CSUN put the ball in Fluker's hands for the final shot, but she was unable to convert the mid-range jumper, handing the ""òChos their second conference win of the season.  It was a gutsy win for Santa Barbara as they climbed back despite falling behind by six points multiple times throughout the game. Danae Miller, in particular, showed her resilience as she was able to hit the game-tying three-point shot despite struggling for much of the game. With this season being a rebuild for UCSB, it will be important for it to build upon these types of games to gain momentum for not only the remainder of this year but also for years to come.  The Gauchos will be back in action at Hawaii this upcoming Wednesday at 9 p.m. as they look to pick up their third win in conference play. †

Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Late turnovers led to opponents' capitalizing on these mistakes, as the Gauchos fall 57-61 against UC Davis during weekend conference play. With the loss, the Gauchos now fall just under the .750 win percentage mark. On the season, UCSB currently stands at an overall record of 17-6 after splitting last week's Big West doubleheader, which included a 70-64 home victory Wednesday night against CSUN. Following these results, the Gauchos still remain in second place of Big West league standings, with a conference record of 6-3. Meanwhile, fifth-place CSUN and sixth-place UC Davis continue to feature as middle-of-the-table teams with each side at a 4-4 conference record. Early into Saturday night's match, everything seemed to be going the Gauchos' way. At the 12:12 mark, a mid-range jump shot from freshman guard S√©kou Tour√© put UCSB up by seven points. Shortly after, UC Davis would respond with a three-pointer of its own, which brought the score to 8-12. Following an exchange of two-point jumpers, junior guard Max Heidegger brought the difference back to seven after draining it from behind the arc. About halfway through the first half of play, things began to go more in favor of the Aggies. A made layup by UC Davis's Stefan Gonzalez, which included a free throw at the foul line, was all it took for the Aggies to bring the score all level once more at 17-17. Each team swapped the lead several times before the score was all tied again, at 25-25, by the 1:57 mark. By this point, the visitors controlled all the momentum and sought to find a comfortable lead entering halftime. A made layup in the final seconds of play, by TJ Shorts II, earned UC Davis that very lead as the Aggies held a 31-25 advantage over the Gauchos.  The halftime talk and coaching readjustments must have helped the Gaucho players plenty, as the team began the second half of play with a three-point jumper from sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin. By the 16:00 mark, the hosts had only needed four minutes until they found the lead once more at 33-32. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the Aggies did their best to halt any more momentum past this. A couple more lead changes were experienced in the following minutes, and by the 12:45 mark the score was all level at 36-36, then at 38-38, and again at 43-43. At this point the game was seemingly unpredictable as neither team was truly able to pull away. With less than three minutes left in the final half of play, a two-point jumper from Heidegger tied the game for the Gauchos at 53-53. In response, UC Davis's Joe Mooney scored a devastating deep three that essentially would keep the Gauchos at bay for the remainder of the game. A clutch pair of free throws from UCSB's Devearl Ramsey, which brought the score to 57-60, still kept the team in the game for the final seconds of play. However, needing either a steal or a foul on the game's final possession ultimately resulted in free throws for the Aggies. The visitors went on to take this upset victory by a score of 61-57. Stat leaders for the Gauchos were Heidegger and freshman forward Amadou Sow. Heidegger led his side in scoring, with 11 points, and had a game-leading five assists on the night. As for Sow, he finished with a game-leading seven rebounds to go along with his stat line of eight points in 22 minutes. The Gauchos are on the road all of next week, with a Thursday meeting against UC Riverside and then a Saturday meeting against UC Irvine.††

They've chosen to build their team around coachable players to reliably build teamwork and chemistry, with the hopes of signing or drafting a couple superstars along the way. The franchise has been praised by players, coaches, analysts and media personalities for their loyalty toward their players, and in 2011, that loyalty was rewarded. Aging superstar Dirk Nowitzki put on a historical NBA finals performance and propelled the Mavs to victory against the star-studded juggernaut that was the Miami Heat. Unfortunately, the following eight years were filled with disappointment seen through multiple first round exits, if they even managed to luck into the postseason. Their style of basketball has a hard time finding success in this era of the NBA: a time characterized by superstars taking pay cuts and teaming up to win. With Dirk's retirement imminent, the Mavs needed a new franchise piece that would take them to the next level, and in the 2018 draft, their prayers were answered in the coming of Euroleague superstar Luka Doncic. With international experience and exceptional veteran guidance under his belt, Doncic has taken the league by storm. At the young age of 19, Doncic is the clear frontrunner for Rookie of the Year and has led the Mavs to more wins this season than they did last. It's clear that Doncic just needs the assistance of another All-Star caliber player to push the Mavs back into championship contention. Fortunately, Porzingis ""î PorzinGOD, the Zinger, KP6 or whatever you want to call him ""î was traded by the New York Knicks to the Dallas Mavericks on Jan. 31. Porzingis and the Knicks' front office had met earlier that day to discuss his future with the franchise, and within two hours, a deal was closed. The Knicks also managed to trade away two other large contracts in the form of Tim Hardaway Jr. and Courtney Lee. This frees up almost $75 million in cap space to gamble with this offseason and potentially land two big-name superstars such as Kevin Durant and/or Kyrie Irving. Additionally, the Knicks were able to fix their drafting error and finally obtained Dennis Smith Jr. as part of the trade. Lastly, while the Knicks may continue to lose games, it does increase their odds of landing the No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft, presumably to use on Zion Williamson. Meanwhile, the Mavs' addition of Porzingis gave them the All-Star caliber player they needed to pair with Doncic. While there were initial worries of KP leaving in 2020, his love and respect for Dirk are strong signs that he'll choose to stay. Cuban said that he won't make the same mistake he did back in the early 2000s of letting Steve Nash, who would win back-to-back MVPs, leave for Phoenix. † In my opinion, the Mavs won this trade. It's important to note that the Knicks are basing their future on luck, but there are reasons why the Knicks have been stuck in mediocrity since the early 2000s. Their front office and ownership are infamous for poor management, and that infamy coupled with the pressure of playing in the ""úMecca of basketball""ù makes New York a perilous destination for superstars. On the other hand, Dallas is the exact opposite: a small market team with competent ownership. With all this in mind and barring any injuries, one thing's for certain: Here comes the Mavs. Comments are closed.

sports,"NBA Media Circus Seeks Views, Ignores Truth About Stars",14-Feb-19,5:05 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/nba-media-circus-seeks-views-ignores-truth-about-stars/," It's almost unheard of to see a press conference tirade after a victory ""î especially a blowout victory. After all, as the old adage in sports goes, ""úWinning cures everything""ù. But last Wednesday, following Golden State's 39-point demolition of the undermanned Spurs, Kevin Durant saved the largest fireworks for his press conference. After refusing to talk to the media for eight straight days, Durant exploded into a three-minute rant, blaming the media for twisting his words and speculating about his future. Durant has never handled criticism well ""î just look at all the burner accounts on Twitter justifying his move to Golden State. I was one of the people who criticized Durant for that move; to me, it felt more like a cop-out than anything else. If Durant truly wanted to prove he was the best player in the league, he shouldn't have joined the reigning NBA champions. Yet Kevin Durant is unequivocally correct in calling out the media. In doing so, he paints a broader picture of the issues surrounding sports journalism in the 21st century. In a society that craves sensationalism and Buzzfeed-esque articles and in a world that revolves around social media, sports journalism has morphed into what feels like a glorified tabloid section. When Kristaps Porzingis was traded from the Knicks to the Mavericks ""î a trade made mostly to clear the Knicks' cap space ""î multiple basketball insiders claimed that the Knicks ""úhad evidence""ù that Kevin Durant would sign with them in free agency. Now, there is no problem with a reporter expressing their opinion, as long as they make it known that it is just that: the opinion of the writer. If Ethan Strauss, the reporter from the The Athletic who Durant specifically called out, wanted to write an opinion piece on Durant's upcoming free agency, he should have labeled his piece as such. If he wanted to write a feature about it, he could have talked to Warriors brass, Knicks brass, Durant's teammates and Durant himself about the impending decision. It's almost impossible to write a credible article when you can't get a single source to go on the record. Durant himself has said on multiple occasions that he has no ties to the Knicks and that he knows nothing about their long-term plans. Yet, in an effort to get clicks, reporters keep making it seem like it's a done deal that Durant will ultimately sign there this summer. Some people may wonder why Durant doesn't just clarify the facts himself with the media. If he's so fed up about being misrepresented, why didn't he talk to the media for more than eight days straight? The reason: Mainstream sports media continues to take quotes out of context in order to push a narrative. Look at Kyrie Irving, a player who many people believe will team up with Durant in New York after the season. All of last week, people quoted Irving saying, ""úI don't owe anybody shit,""ù in response to questions about his free agency plans. Even highly respected journalists like ESPN's Marc Stein used this quote to make it seem like Irving's leaving was a foregone conclusion. In the context of the full quote, however, Irving's words merely portray a man who is frustrated with the constant rumors from the media. In the same exact quote, Irving stated he ""ústill has confidence in Boston and the plan for the future""ù ""î a part of the statement that was conveniently left out by reporters. Kyrie Irving is certainly no lock to stay in Boston beyond this year; the team has been underperforming all season, and the players seem to be frustrated in the locker room. If Irving doesn't believe he can win a championship, he will leave. But to suggest that Irving and Durant have some master plan to meet up in New York is ludicrous. The Knicks have proven time and time again their incompetence as a franchise. Just because they cleared the cap space does not mean they will land one or both of the superstars. If Irving and Durant are fed up with the media now, imagine what would happen if they played in New York. And yet, every rumor connects Durant and Irving to the Knicks with little to no evidence. Reporters constantly push the narrative that superstars will just flock to big-market franchises like birds migrating north. Remember when Paul George was considered a lock to join the Lakers ""î how did that one turn out? As a fellow journalist, I get it. Journalism is a dying field, and in the era of fast-paced social media, reporters are fighting tooth and nail for every click, every interaction. People no longer have the time or attention span to read a full-blown article, and these out-of-context soundbites certainly help them accomplish their goal. But that's not the role of the media. The media exists to keep teams and players honest, to give greater insight to fans following from home. The media's job is not to speculate, to make up rumors or to act like they're coming from a verified source. I'm just as frustrated as Kevin Durant when it comes to this sensationalism. Journalists are already maligned in mainstream society thanks to the myth of ""úfake news.""ù When journalists and reporters purposely speculate for clicks and interactions, it just adds fuel to the fire.  †After watching all of this unfold, why should a UCSB player or coach trust me to not twist their words? By purposely misrepresenting others' views in an effort to get clicks, sports journalists are undermining the integrity of all sports journalists ""î including those of us at the Daily Nexus.

sports,No. 6 UCSB Claws Past No. 4 UCLA in Key Signature Victory,14-Feb-19,12:07 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-14/no-6-ucsb-claws-past-no-4-ucla-in-key-signature-victory/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus Senior outside hitter Corey Chavers picked the right night to play one of the best games of his season as he tallied 20 kills to lead the No. 6 UCSB men's volleyball team to a huge victory over No. 4 UCLA, 3-2 with set scores of 25-18, 21-25, 25-20, 19-25, 15-12. For Chavers, this is the third time this year he has surpassed 20 kills in one match and just the seventh time overall in his illustrious four-year career. As for his team, this is Santa Barbara's first win over UCLA since the 2015 season. Even more impressive, this is UCSB's ninth-consecutive victory, the longest active streak since 1992 and the best mark in the Rick McLaughlin era. The Gauchos' 38th overall win over national powerhouse UCLA pushes their record to a very impressive 12-3 mark and gives them even more confidence heading into their first conference tilt of the season on Friday. As for the Bruins, they fall to 10-3 on the year with all three of their losses coming to Big West opponents, Long Beach State, CSUN and UCSB tonight. Tonight's win over UCLA means a lot for UCSB. The Gauchos have tallied a total of six wins over nationally ranked opponents coming into tonight, but there is something about the Bruins being the seventh that makes it so much sweeter. It's probably because Santa Barbara also avenged its previous loss to UCLA this season, 3-0 at Pauley Pavillion, which coincidentally was also the last time the Gauchos lost this season. Unlike their last meeting, however, the Gauchos came out firing to start as in the first set they earned 13 kills on an impressive .524 percentage while holding the Bruins to six kills on .133. Even on the scoreboard, UCSB pounced on the Bruins, jumping out to a very quick 8-3 lead. Still, the No. 4 in the nation would not go away, earning six of the next nine points to be down just two at 11-9. A kill from Chavers, then consecutive service aces by the Gauchos grew their lead back to five, and from there they kept a healthy distance with the Bruins never cutting the lead past three. At 19-16, UCSB would tally six of the final eight points to win the set. In the second, UCLA flipped the script as after being tied at 4-4 to start, the Bruins would go on to take a 10-6 lead. At 11-7, two attack errors by UCLA and then a kill by the Gauchos would put the home team within one. However, the Bruins would then use a score nine of the next 13 points to take a commanding 20-14 lead and would eventually cruise to a win in the second set tying the match at 1-1. In the third, both teams would again trade scores at the beginning, but UCSB would eventually jump out to an 11-6 lead thanks in large part to five attack errors from UCLA. From there, Santa Barbara was never threatened ""î never letting their lead get below four ""î and would take a 2-1 lead in the match. The fourth set saw UCLA jump out to a 7-3 lead, but the Gauchos would tie the match at 9-9 thanks to two more kills from Chavers and one from fellow outside hitter Ryan Wilcox. The freshman also contributed a fine outing tallying 10 kills on 28 attacks. This is just the fifth time this season Wilcox has notched double-digit kills. Three straight points from UCLA's junior outside hitter Austin Matautin ""î one kill and two service aces ""î would push his team's lead back to three. From there the two squads traded scores until 20-17. A service error by UCSB followed by a kill from Bruin junior middle blocker Daenan Gyimah and another ace from Matautin would give UCLA a comfortable six-point lead which they rode to force a decisive fifth set. In the final set, UCSB played its guts out. Down 3-1 early, the Gauchos would not go quietly, as kills from Chavers and taking advantage of UCLA's mistakes would eventually tie the match at 8-8. Tied at 10-10, UCSB's freshman middle blocker Brandon Hicks came up huge with a big block to see his team take the lead. Following that, Hicks would stay in the limelight coming up with a huge service ace that was nearly too far aimed at the right corner, but somehow stayed in and gave UCSB a 12-10 lead. Following an error, Wilcox tallied a very significant kill to extend the lead back to two. The two teams would trade points once more, but at 14-12, UCLA would register its sixth attack error of the set that would go on to be the decisive game-winning point for the Gauchos. For weeks now, UCSB has tried to make the case that it is a legit contender. Wins against BYU, Lewis, etc. were great, but there is something about beating UCLA, a team that has won 19 National Championships, that means a bit more. UCSB will take on UC San Diego at 7 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 15 at the RIMAC Arena Box Office. A version of this article appeared on p. 6 of the Feb. 14, 2019 print edition of the†Daily Nexus.

sports,Rainbow Wahine Blow Out UCSB 72-49,15-Feb-19,6:30 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-15/rainbow-wahine-blow-out-ucsb-72-49/," After picking up their second win in conference play, the UCSB women's basketball team was unable to string together their second consecutive win in a row as they lost to Hawaii by 23 points.  Santa Barbara entered this contest with an overall record of 5-17, with a 2-8 record in conference play. Despite struggling early on in the year, the squad had shown flashes especially with their most recent win against CSUN. Junior star guard Coco Miller has been huge for the ""òChos and would need to play big in order for them pick up the win.

It was a slow start for UCSB as they shot 31 percent from the field and also went zero for three from the three-point line. One positive for the gauchos was the play of junior center Natalia Bruening, as she scored four points and controlled the boards. Both Coco Miller and Danae Miller struggled mightily from the field as they combined for zero for six.  Hawaii was led by junior guard Courtney Middap who had five quick points in the first period. Middap has been a stabilizing force for the Rainbow Wahine as she is averaging eight points on the season along with a team high two assists per game. They would end the first period with a four point lead, behind strong defense which created three turnovers.  The second quarter was much of the same as Hawaii was able to extend their lead to six points. It was less of a slugfest in the period as both teams started to find their rhythm offensively. Sophomore guard Bri Anugwom started to look for her shot more which led to six points behind two three pointers.  One of the key takeaways from the first half was that Hawaii was able to get to the free throw line much more often than the gauchos as they shot four more free throws, which was really the only difference in the game thus far.  The game started to get away from Santa Barbara in the third period as the Rainbow Wahine outscored them by 15 points which gave them a commanding 21 point lead. Hawaii's leading scorer Makenna Woodfolk started to get more involved as she hit two three-pointers while Middap continued her hot hand with six points, leading to a 17-to-nothing run in their favor.  With UCSB down 21 at the start of the fourth period, they would be unable to chip into the lead and would end up losing by 23 points. The Gauchos shot 17 percent from the field in the final quarter, which made it impossible to get on any kind of run.  This game seemed to follow the path of most UCSB games this year as they have struggled to find consistency on the offensive end of the floor. Much of this can be attributed to the team still lacking an identity, whether that be a gritty defensive team or a team that constantly attacks the paint.  One thing that must happen for UCSB to start having more success as the season comes closer to an end will be for both Coco Miller and Danae Miller to be more consistent on the offensive end of the floor. As the two leaders on the team, it will be up to them to make more of an impact and provide a spark for the team.  With this being a rebuilding season for Santa Barbara, it will be important to take the positives away from every game this season. As long as they constantly give maximum effort, the results will start going in their favor.  UCSB is back in action at home against UC Irvine this upcoming Saturday at 4 p.m. in the Thunderdome where they will look to get back on track.

sports,Red-Hot Riverside Dusts Gauchos on the Road,15-Feb-19,6:21 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-15/red-hot-riverside-dusts-gauchos-on-the-road/," For the first time this season, the UCSB men's basketball team lost its second straight game with a 71-57 crop-dusting on the road against UC Riverside. Highlanders' junior guard Dikymbe Martin hit the 1,000-point milestone for his career on Thursday evening when he posted 18 points on 6-12 shooting and 2-3 from deep. Martin is the fifth Highlander in Riverside history to meet that feat. Riverside had four players in double figures as Dominick Pickett added 14 points while he dropped 5-6 from the field in addition to seven rebounds and five assists and DJ McDonald contributed with 11 points to shoot 4-6 on field goals.  Against a Gaucho team that allowed opponents to shoot just 27 percent from beyond the arc, Riverside knocked down 11-15 from beyond the arc, good for 65 percent of the triples. Contrarily, UCSB hit just 4-22 from the perimeter as the Gauchos struggled from the field all night.  UCSB falls to 17-7 overall, 6-4 in conference following the loss and drop down to a tie for the third spot in the Big West with Hawaii. Riverside improves to 3-7 to move into a tie for seventh with Long Beach State. As every Big West foe finds themselves in a chase to catch 9-1 UC Irvine, dropping games to lower end teams will not help the push. Riverside opened as hot as a cast-iron skillet and went 9-10 from the field including 5-5 from around the perimeter to start out on the right foot against SB. While the ""òChos did everything they could to keep pace with the Highlanders, Riverside's hot-shooting appeal was insurmountable to Santa Barbara who couldn't efficiently contest the tries from deep.  The Gauchos successfully worked the ball into freshman big Amadou Sow who notched 12 points in the first half, and it seemed as if Pasternack had a game plan to dissect the Riverside defense.  Each towering at over 7-feet tall, Highlander freshman Callum McRae and redshirt senior Menno Dijkstra each found themselves in foul trouble early as Sow attacked the rack. UCSB looked to feed their freshmen in the paint, however Riverside managed to put pressure on Sow in the post with a double team and the big man was unable to dish it out to his open teammates around the perimeter. Sow hooked home a smooth turnaround lay-in off the window to cut the deficit to 32-27 which put the Gauchos in striking distance, but an 8-1 tear from back-to-back DJ McDonald triples put UCR on top 40-28 with under three minutes to play in the half.  Riverside shot 65 percent in the first half and 73 percent from deep, but hardly slowed down from there. Santa Barbara contained UCR for the first few possessions in the first half, but the Highlanders caught fire once again with a 9-0 run to balloon the gap up to 16 points at 12:15 left in the second half.  Riverside went blow for blow with every Gaucho bucket in the second and UCSB found itself in desperation trying to claw back into a double-digit deficit without being able to get stops on the defensive end. Armond Davis splashed a trey with five minutes to play to make it a 64-49 ballgame, but that was UCSB's only three within the second half.  The Gauchos opened up shooting 3-5 from deep but closed out by going an unfathomable 1-17 on threes to close out the game. While UCR added 15 assists as a team, the Gauchos had only four helpers the whole night, a testament to their struggles on the offensive end of the floor.  On top of that, UCSB managed to snag 20 UCR turnovers, but couldn't capitalize where it needed to with only 10 points that came off of takeaways.  The Gauchos face their toughest task of the season on the road against UC Irvine on Saturday evening at 9 p.m. at the Bren Center in Irvine, Calif. The game will be broadcast on ESPN2.

sports,"Gauchos Tripped Up at Irvine, Drop Third Straight",18-Feb-19,6:06 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-18/gauchos-tripped-up-at-irvine-drop-third-straight/,"Devearl Ramsey scores despite two defenders being right on top of him. Angie Banks / Daily Nexus It's been a tough three-game stretch for the UCSB men's basketball team and traveling to Irvine on Saturday didn't help with the Gauchos' recent struggles. The 10-1 Anteaters rolled over the 6-5 Santa Barbara Gauchos with an 83-70 win as UCI remains atop the Big West while SB drops into fifth place with the loss.  The Gauchos started the season on a 14-3 tear heading into conference play, and won their first three Big West Conference matchups, but since UCSB has been limited to just three wins in eight tries and has seemingly lost its identity as of late.  Evan Leonard went to town on UCSB in the Eater's eighth consecutive triumph with 23 points on 7-11 shooting including a 3-6 mark from downtown. In the front court, graduate forward Jonathan Galloway notched a double-double behind 14 points and 11 rebounds for his fifth 10-and-10 performance this season and his second in the past three contests. Junior guard Max Heidegger was the leading scorer for the Gauchos with 17 points on 7-16 from the field and 1-6 from deep. Four Gauchos scored in double figures including an 11-point, six rebound performance from Devearl Ramsey to tie a career-high in single-game rebounds for the sophomore. Irvine caught fire from the field early with an 11-0 run to open up against UCSB and kept the pressure on as the lead swelled up to 30-10 within the blink of an eye.  Redshirt freshman Collin Welp has been a Gaucho killer all season and it was no different in the Bren Center on Saturday evening.  Welp added 10 in the first half on 4-5 from the field en route to a 12-point night in just 14 minutes on the hardwood. The last time these two teams met, Welp went 6-9 on field goals on his way to another 12-point performance while playing just 10 minutes. Imagine what this kid could do if he ran a full 30. The Eaters' lead hit a game-high 21 points after graduate guard Robert Cartwright corralled a Devearl Ramsey miss, took it coast-to-coast, and swung it out for a Max Hazzard triple with 5:15 left in the first to put UCI on top 37-16. Gaucho freshman Jay Nagle caught fire for a five-point swing of his own to help cut the lead to 14 at the break as Irvine led 42-28 after one.  In the second, the Gauchos went blow-for-blow with UCI when Max Heidegger and Evan Leonard took over for their respective squads. While Heidegger added 15 of his 17 in the second half, it was Leonard and Jonathan Galloway that stole the show to put it away for UCI.  The dynamic duo accounted for 25 of Irvine's 41 second-half points while they shot a combined 7-12 from the field in the final 20-minute frame.  Although UCSB clawed back within eight at the 3:44 mark following pair of free throws by freshman Amadou Sow who had 12 points, Irvine capitalized from the line to close it out.  The Eaters drilled 15 of 18 from the stripe to close this one out, and the only misses from Irvine on free throws came from Galloway who went 4-8 from the line. As if the Gauchos weren't already struggling to stay afloat as of late, their schedule gets no easier from here.  The UCSB men's basketball team hosts third place Hawaii who boasts a 7-4 record this upcoming Thursday, before the 8-3 Cal State Fullerton Titans who currently reside in the No. 2 spot of the Big West standings come to town on Saturday, Feb. 23.

sports,"Gauchos Back in Town, Host Hawai'i and Cal State Fullerton in Conference Doubleheader",21-Feb-19,1:23 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/gauchos-back-in-town-host-hawaii-and-cal-state-fullerton-in-conference-doubleheader/,"Men's basketball returns to Santa Barbara this week, as the Gauchos prepare to host their last Big West doubleheader of the regular season. Following this week of play, only three more conference fixtures remain before postseason basketball commences. After last week's forgettable results on the road, in which UCSB fell 71-57 to UC Riverside and 83-70 to UC Irvine, the Gauchos will want to get back to their winning ways as soon as possible. This will be the second time this season that UCSB has faced both of these upcoming sides, with its earlier encounter against Hawai'i resulting in a 75-54 road win and an 81-60 road loss versus Cal State Fullerton. Prior to UCSB's current three-game losing streak, the Gauchos had gone all season without back-to-back losses. With the advantage of hosting these next two matchups, the team will have a unique opportunity to turn the tide back in its favor and finish out conference play strong. On the season, UCSB currently stands at an overall record of 17-8, and a pair of wins this week would be enough to bring the win percentage back above the .700 mark. The Gauchos' conference record of 6-5 has them as a middle-of-the-table team at the moment, in terms of Big West league standings. Although the team's away record of 5-6 isn't all that exciting, its 10-2 home record should inspire the possibility of getting back on track this week. If all goes well, the Gauchos can carry that momentum into next week, when they'll host Long Beach State for the final home game of the regular season. Thursday's opponent will feature a Hawai'i side that has been on a roll as of late. The Rainbow Warriors stand at an overall record of 16-9 on the season but have won five of their last seven matches, with the Gauchos taking responsibility for one of those losses. They'll be coming off back-to-back wins, with their most recent resulting in an 87-64 victory over UC Riverside. Historically, the UCSB versus Hawai'i all-time series has been thoroughly level, with an even 11-11 record in the 22 times these two sides have faced each other. As for Cal State Fullerton, the Titans have seemingly found their form. Although their overall record of 12-13 on the season doesn't speak volumes, their 8-3 conference record does. Currently on a three-game win streak, Cal State Fullerton will be coming off a 78-71 road win over CSUN last time out. However, the Titans' away record of 4-9 may favor the Gauchos' dominance when defending the Thunderdome. These two sides are historically familiar with each other, as the Gauchos only hold a slight all-time series lead of 47-40 in the 87 total matchups experienced. Players to watch this week for the Gauchos include the backcourt tandem of sophomore guard Devearl Ramsey and junior guard Max Heidegger. In the game against UC Irvine last time out, both players reached double-digit scoring. Heidegger led all Gaucho scorers with 17 points to his name, to go along with his stat line of three assists and two steals. Meanwhile, Ramsey appeared to be all over the court with his team-leading six rebounds on the night, along with a stat line of 11 points, three assists and two steals of his own. As for Hawai'i, sophomore guard Drew Buggs and senior forward Jack Purchase appear to be the offensive catalysts for their side. Buggs is a top-five scorer for the Rainbow Warriors, but he is best known for his playmaking skills considering he leads Hawai'i in total assists, by a wide margin, with 144 to his name ""î over a third of the team's combined assists output. Purchase, on the other hand, leads his team in total scoring with 295 points on the season, while coming in second in most rebounds for his side with a total of 150. It's the senior-guard show for the Titans, as Kyle Allman Jr. and Khalil Ahmad are the ones to watch for Cal State Fullerton. With only four points separating the two, Allman Jr. leads the Titans in total scoring with 444 as Ahmad follows closely with 440. Both players also find themselves in the top four of their team's assists and rebounds category, and UCSB should expect their presence all over the court come game time. All the action starts this Thursday, Feb. 21 , as the Gauchos host Hawai'i at 8 p.m., then Cal State Fullerton comes to town on Saturday, Feb. 23, with tip-off set for 7 p.m. Both bouts are set to take place at the Thunderdome. ††††††

sports,Gauchos Set For Home-Opener Against Hartford,21-Feb-19,10:42 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/gauchos-set-for-home-opener-against-hartford/,"Armani Smith scoops up a ground ball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus After being rained out of usual sunny Santa Barbara last week, the UCSB baseball team will play its home opener this Friday when it hosts the University of Hartford for a three-game series. The Gauchos head into the match-up holding an even 2-2 record, following split series against Loyola Marymount ""î after the series was cut from three games to two and relocated to LMU ""î and against UNLV. In both series, UCSB won the first contest and came up short in the second. As for the Hawks, they will start their 2019 campaign against the Gauchos on Friday as they will travel to Santa Barbara for just the second time in program history. The first time Hartford visited UCSB was back in the 2016 campaign. That three-game series ended with UCSB sweeping Hartford. In fact, those three meetings are the only matchups between these two programs in history. Of course, the sequel hopes to be better considering how these two teams have changed since then. Back in 2016, UCSB was on its way to a 43-win season when it swept Hartford as well as its first College World Series appearance in program history. Fast forward three years later and Santa Barbara has won just 51 games in the past two losing seasons amassing an overall record of 51-60-1, the worst two-year stretch Head Coach Andrew Checketts since donning the blue and yellow in 2012. Hartford, however, is coming off one of its most successful seasons in school history. Although the record might not show it being just 26-31, the Hawks secured first place in both the regular season and in the America East Tournament to reach their first NCAA postseason regional in program history. Hartford is expected to be just as good this season considering it was selected to repeat as conference champions in the conference preseason poll. Part of the reason expectations are high for the Hawks is the return of sophomore Nicholas Dombkowski, who is the first pitcher in conference history to win both America East Rookie of the Year and Pitcher of the Year honors in the same season. Other key returners are senior letter winners Ashton Bardzell and Chris Sullivan who each batter over .270 and had 25 RBI's. Now, UCSB has come a long way in the past two years and if there was one year to go all in on the Gauchos getting back to CWS form, this would be the one. The reason is simple: pitching. The past two seasons, UCSB held a team ERA average of 4.73, a whole run higher than its average in 2016 which was 3.73. Checketts main coaching point has been pitching, after all, he came from Oregon as a renowned pitching coach. To that point, In total, Checketts has coached 12 pitchers drafted in the top 10 rounds since 2001. This year, UCSB looks to have a much better staff in place. Now, Santa Barbara has allowed 5.5 runs in its first four games but in its two wins it allowed just two. In its two losses, it allowed nine. The staff is highlighted by junior right-hander Chris Lincoln. Lincoln earned a position in the starting role last year and was great, however, this year he will help be helping out the bullpen as the ""òChos ace and closer. In his first, and only, appearance this season, the Moreno Valley, Calif. native tossed four no-hit innings and struck out five. Other key pitchers include starters Ben Brecht and Jack Dashwood. For Brecht, the southpaw picked up the opening day win after scattering seven hits while striking out five and allowing just two earned runs. Dashwood had a nearly identical game tossing five innings, allowing just two earned on five hits while striking out seven. Offensively, the ""òChos are also loaded exploding for 35 runs in their first four games. Nearly every batter has been impressive, but sophomore infielder Andrew Martinez has been playing spectacular batting .500 with seven runs batted in. He is also one of five Gauchos to have hit a home run this season. Other key hitters include senior catcher Thomas Rowan and freshman infielder Christian Kirtley who each have five RBI's. Overall, this is a very exciting weekend for UCSB to try to capture some early season magic. The two losses the Gauchos have suffered have been self-inflicted in that in both games they have blown a sizeable lead. That being said, there is nothing like being home, a place that Checketts has coached exceptionally well with a 141-67-3 record over his tenure. UCSB will play its home opener against Hartford at 2 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 22 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 21, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,"UCSB Looks to Keep Momentum Against Fullerton, LBSU",21-Feb-19,1:25 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/ucsb-looks-to-keep-momentum-against-fullerton-lbsu/,"Following their biggest win of the season over UC Irvine, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to build on its newfound momentum when it takes on Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State this week. For the first time all season, the Gauchos were firing on all cylinders in their 71-52 victory over the 16-6 Anteaters. Led by 21 points from junior guard Coco Miller and 20 points from sophomore point guard Danae Miller ""î in addition to 19 points from the bench ""î Santa Barbara was able to knock off the second-place squad. With the victory, the Gauchos leapfrogged Cal Poly into eighth place in the conference. If the postseason started today, UCSB would be the final team in the Big West tournament, while Cal Poly would fail to qualify. With five games left, however, there is more work to be done starting this Thursday when the Gauchos travel to Fullerton. After starting conference play 3-1, the Titans have dropped their last six games, leaving them in seventh place in the conference. With a victory, UCSB would jump Fullerton in the conference, making the matchup crucial to both teams' postseason hopes. Much of Fullerton's conference struggles have stemmed from their at-times anemic offense; after averaging more than 67 points in non-conference play, the Titans have merely scored 58 points a game during conference play. In the first matchup between these teams, Fullerton only scored 59 points but held the Gauchos to a lowly 52 points on 36 percent shooting from the floor. Despite their offensive struggles, Fullerton is an elite defensive team, holding opponents to only 39 percent shooting from the floor. The Titans heavily feature senior center Daeja Smith on the offensive end, scoring averaging 13 points on 53 percent shooting for the season. In that first matchup, Smith dominated for the Titans, scoring 18 points and also grabbing ten boards. If the Gauchos hope to beat Fullerton on their home court, they will need continued production from their backcourt. In that first matchup, Coco Miller struggled heavily, scoring only six points on 2-14 shooting. Santa Barbara will also need their bench to step up to keep pace with the Titans. While junior Tal Sahar didn't play in the first matchups between these teams, the Gauchos merely scored nine points off the bench. With Sahar, the Gauchos' best playmaker off the bench, back in the fold, look for UCSB to be more explosive with the reserve unit. The Gauchos will have a quick turnaround after their last match, with their game at Long Beach State on Saturday at 4 p.m. As another team that has struggled for much of conference play, the 49ers are only one game up on UCSB in the conference standings, sitting in sixth place with a 4-7 conference record.  LBSU will be looking for revenge on Saturday after Santa Barbara knocked them off the first time around, 60-54. The Beach has also struggled offensively this season, with the team averaging fewer than 57 points per game. A major component of UCSB's success in the first matchup between these teams against the 49ers was shutting down sophomore guard Shanaijah Davison, who leads the team with 14 points per game. Santa Barbara's defense frustrated Davison all throughout the game, with the star guard scoring merely seven points while turning the ball over six times before ultimately fouling out. With Long Beach lacking size in the paint, look for the Gauchos to feed junior center Natalia Bruening heavily. On the season, LBSU has been outrebounded by an average of almost 11 rebounds per game ""î a huge factor behind why the team has struggled so much in conference play. While Bruening has often grappled with foul trouble this season, she has proven to be an efficient rebounder when on the floor, averaging nearly six rebounds per game in only 24 minutes per game. Against the two teams directly above them in the standings, Santa Barbara can make up serious ground this week in conference play. While both games will be on the road ""î where Santa Barbara has only won one game all season †""î the Gauchos will look to ride their momentum from their huge upset win against UC Irvine. UCSB will take on Cal State Fullerton on Thursday at 5 p.m. before traveling to Long Beach to take on LBSU on Saturday at 4 p.m.

sports,"UCSB Softball Heads South, Aims to End Four-Game Skid",21-Feb-19,5:22 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-21/ucsb-softball-heads-south-aims-to-end-four-game-skid/,"Sammy Fabian fields a ground ball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB softball team will be back in non-conference action this week as they travel down to Cathedral City to take part in the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic. The Gauchos are 3-5 on the season, and are now trying to bounce back from a rough showing at the 28th Annual Campbell Classic last weekend. After winning the first game of the tournament against GCU, UCSB proceeded to drop four games straight, including an 8-0 blowout loss to Northern Illinois University. However, there were some positive signs for the team that they can capitalize on moving forward. One of these bright spots so far has been the play of sophomore outfielder Sammy Fabian. Fabian currently owns a .467/.500/.567 split statline and has significantly bolstered the Gauchos' offense. She leads the team in hits (14), doubles (3) and runs (6), and has also been very solid on the defensive end as well. While it would be almost impossible to maintain such a high level of production throughout the season, her play so far could very well be a spark plug for the rest of the team. In terms of defense, pitcher Emily Schuttish has been off to a deceptively strong start. Although she currently has a 1-2 record, she already has one save and a complete game to go along with her team-leading 2.14 ERA. Since senior Veronika Gulvin has struggled on the mound to start off her final year as a Gaucho, Schuttish will likely be seeing more playtime as the season goes on which could end up being a blessing in disguise for the team. The rest of the players on the team will definitely have to pick up the pace if they hope to pick up some wins this weekend however. The Gauchos will be facing three teams who are nationally ranked ""î †No. 4 Oklahoma, No. 14 Arizona and No. 17 Oregon. They will also face off against some more tough Pac-12 competition in Utah and a streaky BYU squad that has won three games in a row. The key to this weekend is going to be offensive production. UCSB has won every game in which its scored four runs or more, but the team hasn't scored more than one run in its last four games. The pitching staff has done their job with a decent team ERA of 3.34, but as the strength of their opponents increases immensely this weekend they're going to need some support from the bats. Looking a little closer at the opposition, the Gauchos could potentially face three of the top pitchers in the country. Oregon's Jordan Dail is seventh in the NCAA with 46 strikeouts, Arizona's Taylor McQuillin is ninth with 45 and Oklahoma's Mariah Lopez is tied for 12th with 41. Lopez is also 13th in the nation with a stunning .27 ERA so far, so the Gauchos will have to bring their A-Game if they're hoping to put some runs on the board. Overall, this weekend won't be too indicative of how the rest of the season will play out. These will be the best teams that the Gauchos see all year, and the results of the games have no bearing on their conference position. What will be important, however, is how much fight UCSB comes out with and what lessons the team can take away from playing against the top players in the country. A hard-fought loss to a team like Oklahoma is at its worse a learning experience and at best fuel moving forward knowing that they can compete with the cream of the crop. As long as the effort is there, the Gauchos really can't lose. A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 21, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,"Gauchos Struggle From Field, Fall to CSUF",22-Feb-19,3:20 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-22/gauchos-struggle-from-field-fall-to-csuf/," After an impressive victory against UC Irvine, the UCSB women's basketball team was unable to pick up their second win in a row as they lost to Cal State Fullerton. 
 Santa Barbara would keep it close throughout the entire game and enter the fourth quarter tied but would be outscored by 12 points in the final period. This loss puts the ""òChos at an overall record of 6-19 with a 3-9 conference record.  Redshirt junior guard Coco Miller started the game strong on both ends of the floor with a quick four points along with a rebound and a steal. Coming off one of her best performances of the season against UC Irvine, it would be crucial for her to replicate a similar effort in order for UCSB to come away with the victory. 
 For Cal State Fullerton, they were paced by redshirt sophomore Raina Perez who was on fire in the first quarter. Perez scored 10 points, including two three-pointers, to help put her team up one going into the second quarter. UCSB would play a very well rounded second quarter as they were able to outscore Fullerton by four points in the period. With no turnovers in the second quarter, Santa Barbara was able to score fairly easily behind strong play from Miller who had two three-pointers in the period. 

Although it was a strong quarter for the ""òChos, Fullerton was still shooting 60 percent from the field which meant that UCSB would have to lock in defensively to keep them from continuously scoring easy baskets.  The third quarter was much of the same for both teams as they were both able to score without much resistance. Cal State Fullerton had eight more free throw attempts than Santa Barbara which could be attributed to them constantly putting pressure on the basket. CSUF's senior Jade Vega got to the free throw line six times in the period and made all of her shots to help tie the game heading into the fourth.  Fullerton was able to take over the game in the fourth quarter behind strong play from senior Hannah Thompson who erupted for 10 points in the period alone. At the four minute mark in a one-point contest, they would go on an 11 to nothing run to seal the win.  Miller struggled mightily in this period as she went two for eight from the field, including one for seven from behind the three-point line. With UCSB lacking production from their most consistent scorer, it made it difficult for them to keep up with a red hot Fullerton squad.  CSUF ended up shooting 59 percent from the field in the final quarter compared to a lowly 31 percent for UCSB, which was the reason why Santa Barbara was outscored by 12 points.  In order for the gauchos to be able to close out similar games in the future, they will need a second scorer to emerge behind Miller. Sophomore point guard Danae Miller has shown flashes throughout the season but has been unable to be consistent throughout the year. † In UCSB's wins, both Millers have not only played outstanding but have also provided important leadership to their younger teammates. It will be important for them to continue being vocal as the season comes closer to an end. With just four games remaining in conference play, the gauchos will look to gain some momentum and improve their seed in the conference tournament which is coming up very soon.  Santa Barbara is back in action at Long Beach State this Saturday, where they will look to pick up their fourth conference win at 4 p.m. at the Walter Pyramid.

sports,UCSB Offense Stalls in Road Loss to Long Beach,24-Feb-19,9:09 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-02-24/ucsb-offense-stalls-in-road-loss-to-long-beach/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's basketball team was ultimately doomed by its slow start on Saturday, as the Gauchos fell to Long Beach State 62-53. As has been the case for much of the season, Santa Barbara was sluggish out of the gate, scoring merely six points in the first quarter. While junior center Natalie Bruening put up four points and four rebounds in the quarter, the rest of the team shot a combined 1-11 from the floor. Motivated by its loss at the Thunderdome earlier this season, LBSU scored 16 points in the first quarter behind a solid 39 percent shooting. Star sophomore guard Shaniajah Davison led the team with five points, while sophomore forward Naomi Hunt also chipped in with four points for Beach. Ultimately, that early 10-point †deficit would prove to be insurmountable for the Gauchos. Despite UCSB clawing its way back in the second and third quarters, LBSU closed the game on a 21-12 run to claim victory in a crucial conference matchup. After seeing guards Danae and Coco Miller dominate UC Irvine last week, Long Beach's game plan was simple: Force other Gauchos to score the ball. With the defense constantly hounding her, sophomore Danae Miller played one of her least efficient games of the season, scoring only nine points on 4-16 shooting while also turning the ball over five times. Junior Coco Miller also struggled mightily on Saturday, scoring only three points, courtesy of a single three-pointer. Just as most teams have done in Big West play, Long Beach made sure that every shot Coco Miller had was contested, with Coco only able to get off seven shots on the night. Despite the loss, Bruening put in one of her best shifts on the season, dropping in 16 points to go along with eight rebounds. The Gauchos also received great play from junior guard Tal Sahar off the bench, who led all bench scorers with 13 points. Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, both Bruening and Sahar didn't receive much help on Saturday. As a team, the Gauchos were dominated on the boards, getting outrebounded by a total of 43-30 by a Long Beach team that typically struggles on the boards. Outside of Sahar's 13 points off the bench, Santa Barbara only scored three points off the bench, with the team getting outscored by LBSU's bench on the day. While Long Beach also struggled from the floor, they did just enough to come away with their fifth conference win on the season. With all of LBSU's starters struggling with their efficiency, forward Lauren Green provided a key spark off of the bench, scoring 12 points on an impressive 60 percent shooting clip from the floor. Hunt also proved to be a handful on the boards, grabbing 10 rebounds to go along with her 13 points on the night. Despite shooting only 36 percent as a team, Long Beach was able to turn its 11 offensive rebounds into 11 second-chance points ""î a number that ultimately proved to be the difference. Despite a trying week for the Gauchos, the team will need to regroup and refocus for their game against Cal Poly on Wednesday. After Cal Poly upset Cal State Fullerton on Saturday, the Mustangs and Gauchos are once again tied in eighth place with a 3-10 conference record. With only three conference games yet to be played, Wednesday's matchup between the two sides could be crucial in deciding which team gets a birth to the Big West Tournament.

Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Heading into the final stretch of the season, the UCSB men's basketball team walloped both No. 3 Hawai""òi on Thursday and No. 2 Cal State Fullerton on Saturday to move into the third spot of the Big West. Following the long weekend at home, Santa Barbara improves to 19-8 overall and 8-5 in Big West play with the recent two triumphs in the Thunderdome. Through two seasons with Head Coach Joe Pasternack at the helm, SB is 23-4 at home. ""úWe lost a couple games this week, and I think everybody jumped off the bandwagon,""ù said Pasternack. ""úWhat our guys did is they honored the process this week ""¶ When you honor the process results will follow.""ù Well, the results followed like a tail on a dog.  The Gauchos ripped into Fullerton with a 82-67 win against the Titans as four 'Chos hit double figures, with junior guard Max Heidegger coming off the bench to lead with 19.  In the back court, sophomore JaQuori McLaughlin posted 16 points along with his second consecutive seven-assist performances for back to back games as the Gaucho's leading distributor.  Freshman sensation Amadou Sow added 16 points and four rebounds while captain point guard Devearl Ramsey contributed with 13 points, six rebounds and four steals in the win.  After UCSB lost in Fullerton during the first meeting between these two teams, the Gauchos opened up on a 22-4 run as Heidegger and freshman guard S√©kou Tour√© took over to ensure an early lead.  The Titans stormed back to cut the deficit to 10 points with a 36-26 score at the break behind 12 points in the first from senior Kyle Allman, Jr.  Senior guard Khalil Ahmad pounded the rock in the second half with 20 points on 8-11 from the field en route to a 27-point, four-rebound, three-steal night. Although it looked like Fullerton was poised to make a comeback, the Gauchos broke it wide open with 14 from Amadou Sow on 5-6 shooting in the second. With 2:12 remaining on the clock, McLaughlin caught a pass from graduate guard Ar'mond Davis on the left wing and immediately elected for the dribble drive. The sophomore split the defense and took it right down main street with an open lane to the rack and an exclamation point finish with a flush to put his team up 77-61, and ice the game for UCSB. Santa Barbara out-rebounded Fullerton 39-24 to get the win while six 'Chos had four or more boards. The win against Fullerton came just two days after the Gauchos blew-out Hawai""òi 79-61 to snap a three-game losing streak.  Sow was the hero against the Rainbow Warriors with 18 points on 6-10 shooting along with eight rebounds and three steals. UCSB forced 16 turnovers against the Hawai""òi and limited theirs to only nine giveaways while the 'Chos capitalized on the mistakes of the 'Bows with 29 points off of their takeaways. On top of that, SB mounted 16 assists after averaging just seven in its previous two matchups. ""úThe biggest thing about our offense and why we were successful is there's a correlation when we have 10-15 assist, and we had 16 assists to nine turnovers. JaQuori McLaughlin had 8 assists, zero turnovers. When we're moving the ball like that, we're going to be tough to beat because we have so many different guys that can score,""ù added Coach Pasternack. While limiting UH to just 10 free-throw attempts and holding Hawai""òi to just 2-11 from deep, the Gauchos went into the half with a 30-19 lead. ""úHawai""òi is an explosive team. They're the No. 1 offense in our league and the No. 1 three-point shooting team""¶ one of the top three-point shooting teams in the country,""ù said Pasternack. In the second half, Sow and Davis each fought for 12 points and rebounded well to blow the 'Bows out of the water. The Gauchos' bench outscored opponents 46-14 over the weekend which significantly attributed to the two thrashings against top Big West teams. For its final home game of the regular season, the UCSB men's basketball team will host Long Beach State next Thursday, Feb. 28 as things are expected to be chippy in the Thunderdome with a 7 p.m. tip-off.†

Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus As the UCSB men's basketball team inches closer to the Big West Tournament, the Gauchos find themselves in a battle for the second seed in the conference when Long Beach comes to town for Senior Night. ""úIt's going to be electric,""ù said junior forward Andrew Pickles. ""úIt'll be a bittersweet night for every single one of them, but I'm definitely going to miss playing with them every day.""ù The last time these two teams met, the 'Chos stole one in Walter Pyramid with an 82-71 win behind 24 points and a career-high 11 rebounds from graduate guard Ar'mond Davis to propel SB to the win down the stretch, the one of only two televised conference wins that UCSB has delivered on the year. On top of that freshman sensation Amadou Sow added 14 points on 6-7 shooting with four rebounds despite significant foul trouble early on. Santa Barbara finds itself placed third in the Big West with a 8-5 conference record, 19-8 overall, with three games remaining in the regular season. Following a pair of comfortable wins over the then-third-seeded Hawai'i and second place Cal State Fullerton, UCSB is sandwiched in between the two with a single game advantage over Hawai'i who is 7-6 and just one game behind the 9-4 Fullerton Titans. Davis has accounted for the bulk of UCSB's scoring this season while averaging 13.4 points and 5.6 rebounds per. Nonetheless, the Gauchos have relied on their depth all season as anyone of the five starters can pop off on a given night. All five concurrent starters are averaging double-figures while seven different Gauchos have led the team in scoring during a single contest. As for Beach, it's been a somewhat disappointing season, although there is one silver-lining. Senior guard Deishaun Booker has carried the Niners with 18.1 points per contest, currently third in the Big West, and has surpassed Leon Wood's single-season free-throw record, previously set at 211 in 1984, with three regular season games left on their schedule. Not only has the Las Vegas native made the most single-season free throws in Big West history, but he's knocked them down with an unprecedented 90.4 percent from the line this season, the top mark in the conference. Booker has made the most of his senior campaign, despite only five conference wins for Long Beach who currently sits in the seventh spot of the conference standings. In their last meeting, Booker posted a compelling 25 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists while shooting 12-15 from the stripe. The 49ers rely on scoring from Booker, redshirt senior Temidayo Yussuf, and redshirt senior guard Bryan Alberts, and although Booker has had a career year, this was not the season that Long Beach stated with all of its top scorers out the door at the end of the year. To make matters worse, Booker hasn't been himself from the field as of late. Beach is coming off of two late-game wins against sixth place Northridge and eighth place UC Riverside, but its star senior has shot just 8-29, a disheartening 27 percent from the field in those contests. With Long Beach coming to town, this is the Gauchos' last home game of the year as they face three of the bottom four teams in the Big West to close out the regular season. During handshakes against Long Beach in their last matchup, things got chippy between UCSB and the Niners, so things are expected to get chippy with Beach playing with its season on the line. If that wasn't enough to convince you to support, all fans are entered into two raffles with chances to win either a pair of Coachella tickets or a pair of AirPods. Tip-off is set for 7 p.m. on Thursday evening in the Thunderdome as Santa Barbara hosts Long Beach State in a battle of the beach during the Gauchos 2019 senior night.

With both teams fighting tooth and nail for the last spot in the Big West tournament, Wednesday's 44-42 Gaucho win feels even sweeter than usual. In arguably their worst offensive performance of the season, Santa Barbara's defense did just enough to pull off a potentially season-defining victory. The Gauchos and the Mustangs entered Wednesday's game tied in eighth place in the Big West with a 3-10 conference record; with only two more conference games left, both teams were well aware that Wednesday's game could decide the last spot in the postseason. The result was a defensive slugfest between two sides that have struggled offensively all season. Offensively, Santa Barbara made only 12 field goals the entire game ""î tied for its lowest in a game this season. With Cal Poly often employing a full-court press on sophomore point guard Danae Miller, the Mustangs forced the Gauchos to speed up their offense. When junior center Natalia Bruening was forced to sit after picking up her second foul, the Santa Barbara offense became largely stagnant and perimeter-based. At the half, UCSB found themselves with only 18 points. ""úIn that first half, we really needed to calm down the offense,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úWe had 11 turnovers in the first half, and we were missing our open looks.""ù Despite offensive struggles, Santa Barbara's defensive intensity remained intact throughout. Against a Mustang side that opted to play three bigs at times, Henrickson opted to use a 2-3 zone, forcing Cal Poly into three pointers; on the game, the Mustangs only hit five of their attempted threes. Even with an anemic offensive output, Santa Barbara only found themselves down three points at the half. ""úWhen we couldn't score, we still defended,""ù Henrickson said. ""úOftentimes, when a game is that ugly, it's easy to just give in on [defense] and let it happen.""ù By keeping the game close, the Gauchos gave themselves the opportunity to adjust at halftime. Rather than continuing to rely on inconsistent jumpshots, Henrickson implored the team to be more aggressive and force Cal Poly to foul. Although they didn't make up any ground on the scoreboard in the third quarter, UCSB got four of the five Mustang starters into foul trouble during the quarter, with senior point guard Dye Stahley picking up three fouls in the quarter. That aggressive approach would prove to pay dividends in the fourth quarter, with sophomore guard Hannah Peterson and junior star center Devin Stanback both fouling out for Cal Poly. More importantly, Santa Barbara was able to get to the free-throw line at will during the quarter, with the team scoring 10 of their 15 fourth-quarter points from the line. UCSB finally took the lead with 3:14 left in the fourth when Danae Miller made two free-throws, and the team would never relinquish the lead the rest of the way. The Gauchos ended up scoring their last seven points from the charity stripe, including two from junior guard Coco Miller with one minute left that would ultimately prove to be the difference. Despite their foul trouble, Cal Poly refused to give up; with 1.5 seconds left, the Mustangs found themselves down two and with the ball near half-court. Following a timeout, Cal Poly attempted to inbound the ball to junior Hana Vesela, who was fouled by Danae Miller. With less than a second on the clock, Vesela headed to the line looking to tie the ballgame. But after missing the first free-throw long, Vesela was forced to miss her second attempt and hope for an offensive rebound. Alicia Roufosse corralled the rebound for the Mustangs but was unable to get a good look off before time ran out. In dramatic fashion, the Gauchos had held on for their most important victory of the season. ""úIt's hard to believe that we won with 44 points, but we'll take any victory we can get,""ù Henrickson said. Now, the Gauchos find themselves one game up on Cal Poly in the standings with two games remaining on the schedule. With an away game against first-place UC Davis still left, Santa Barbara will hopeto close out their home schedule with a victory over UC Riverside on Saturday. Comments are closed.

sports,Niners Stun Santa Barbara on Senior Night,3-Mar-19,9:34 AM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-03/niners-stun-santa-barbara-on-senior-night/," During the UCSB men's basketball team's senior night, a night that Gaucho seniors will likely never forget, it was the Long Beach State seniors that got the last laugh with a 69-64 win in the Thunderdome. Santa Barbara honored two unorthodox starters in seniors Ami Lakoju and Maxwell Kupchak but were seemingly off-rhythm and out of sync from the get-go. Long Beach senior Deishaun Booker, in the midst of a career year, was superb to spoil Gaucho Senior Night with 26 points while shooting 9-14 on field goals and 6-6 from the stripe to lead LBSU to its third straight win. ""úThey have the best guard in our league and I think you saw that tonight,""ù Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úWe're going to only go as far as our rebounding and defense takes us""¶ we didn't do that for 40 minutes tonight.""ù Booker surpassed the previous single season free throw record of 211 set by Fullerton Leon Wood in 1984 last week when he hit 10 from line to bring his season total to 216. Currently with 222 free throws this season, the record is rebranded by Booker and still growing. The 49ers got off to a 7-1 lead early on and remained ahead for the majority of the first half. While the Gauchos kept it close with a couple swings and a pair of lead changes about ten minutes in, Beach caught fire behind a triad of triples from senior Bryan Alberts who contributed to a 9-0 run with 3:30 left in the first capped off by an Alberts' assist and a slam by senior forward Mason Riggins to put State in the lead 30-19. Graduate guard Ar'mond Davis and the Gauchos inched closer at half time as Davis added six of his eight in the first half on 2-4 from three to bring SB within nine and cut the score to 34-25 at the break. Sophomore captain Devearl Ramsey opened up the second on an 8-0 tear by himself to close out the lead even more to 34-33 as the Gauchos looked poised to make a hearty comeback with the home crowd back into it. From there, Long Beach went blow-for-blow with UCSB, and although freshman forward Amadou Sow was getting everything he could in the paint, his points weren't coming easily. Sow started shooting 5-5 from the field but ended with 13 points and a 6-11 slate on field goals. The Mali native dragged down a career-high 15 rebounds and dominated the post, but Beach produced through its guards, and Sow wasn't positioned or assigned to stop them. Although momentum was fully in the favor of Long Beach State, the Gauchos took the lead 55-54 on a pair of Max Heidegger free throws with 6:15 left in the second, but Beach quickly scavenged back and took over once again. The Niner lead ballooned to seven with two minutes on the clock, but a five-point swing with a flush from senior Jarriesse Blackmon and a trey from Heidegger pulled the Gauchos within 62-60 with 1:15 left. At the line with 36 seconds on the game clock, sophomore Jordan Roberts missed a free throw that would have iced the game, but Beach corralled the miss and handed it back off to Roberts. ""úFor each of the losses at home, it came down to one rebound,""ù Pasternack said. ""úWe were down two, they got an offensive rebound. Against Irvine, we were up two, 36 seconds to go, they got an offensive rebound. Against UC Davis it was the same thing, they got an offensive rebound. We're 14-4 right now when we out-rebound opponents and we didn't do a good job on that tonight and it cost us the game.""ù Instead of the Gauchos fouling Roberts, a 51 percent free throw shooter, with 29 seconds on the clock, they waited for the sophomore to find Booker, a 90 percent free throw shooter, before committing a foul. Booker, arguably the best free throw shooter in Big West Conference history, was not the right guy to hack down the stretch as he put it away for Long Beach State. The UCSB men's basketball team takes to the road for its final two games of the regular season as it heads to Northridge next Thursday, March 7, before traveling up to Cal Poly on March 9 for the next chapter of the Blue-Green Rivalry.

sports,Gauchos Take Down Highlanders for Second Consecutive Win,4-Mar-19,9:21 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-04/gauchos-take-down-highlanders-for-second-consecutive-win/,"Leonard Paulasa/Daily Nexus After a tight win against rival Cal Poly, the UCSB women's basketball team was able to get their second consecutive win on senior night against UC Riverside with the final score being 61-44, improving to 8-20 overall (5-10).  Santa Barbara honored their only senior, redshirt Paris Jones, before the game. Jones averaged two points and a rebound in a little more than 10 minutes of play on the season as well as provided veteran leadership for the young ""òChos. It was a hot start for both teams as they each shot 47.1 percent from the field. Redshirt junior guard Coco Miller led the way for the Gauchos with five quick points, as she helped create a three-point lead at the end of the first quarter. Miller has been the squad's most reliable scorer as she is averaging a team high 13 points per game this year. Sophomore guard Keilanei Cooper was the early spark for Riverside as she had eight points, including two three-pointers.  The second quarter would be a defensive battle between both squads, which was a stark contrast from the first quarter. Senior forward Malou De Kergret for UCR struggled mightily in the period as she went one for eight from the field. UCSB would head into halftime with a one point lead, as they looked to make their second half adjustments to extend their lead. Santa Barbara ended up dominating the third quarter as they outscored the highlanders by nine points. Miller was on fire as she knocked down three three-pointers, giving her 16 points. Although she has been inconsistent at times, Miller has been huge for the ""òChos in their wins. As the group's best scorer, she has shown the ability to not only knock down three-point shots but also attack the basket. With the season coming close to the end, many fans will look forward to seeing her take her game to another level next season.  UCSB would carry this momentum into the fourth quarter and win the game fairly comfortably by 17 points. Sophomore guard Danae Miller was able to find her rhythm late in the ball game as she scored nine points. Jones checked into the game with two minutes remaining but was unable to score on her layup attempt.  This may have been the Gauchos best defensive quarter all season as they held the highlanders to just five points and 14 percent from the field. UCR was unable to find any rhythm on offense due to the consistent ball pressure and good defense by Santa Barbara.  Despite this being a rebuilding season for UCSB, there is much to be excited about for next season. Everyone from the team except Paris Jones will be returning, allowing the team to grow together with little turnover.  The Gauchos have shown flashes throughout the year but have not been able to string together victories. With the squad continuing to develop their chemistry, they will surely make an impact in the Big West Conference for the next couple seasons.  It would have been easy for Santa Barbara to stop giving their best effort during their tough stretches but head coach Bonnie Henrickson was able to keep the team on course. By continuing to play hard, the team has started to be rewarded by getting more wins. In their past five matchups, UCSB has been able to win three of them, showing that they have taken major strides from earlier in the year. They will put their two game winning streak on the line this upcoming Saturday in their last game of the regular season at 2:30 p.m against UC Davis.

sports,Gauchos Hope To Continue Hot Start to the Season,7-Mar-19,3:19 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/gauchos-hope-to-continue-hot-start-to-the-season/,"Jack Dashwood pitches the ball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The rain and the wins seem to be the main storylines for the UCSB baseball team this season. Not only was its home opener pushed to a road series but two of Santa Barbara's games have been canceled in just the first three weeks of the season. Now, however, UCSB is heading out south for its first true three-game road series of the 2019 campaign as it faces Tulane University. Even more ridiculous, Sunday's forecast in Tulane, Louisiana currently calls for rain. Regardless, focusing on things the Gauchos can control, they have had an excellent start to the season currently boasting an 8-2 overall mark after winning their sixth straight game when they beat Pepperdine 5-3 on Monday for a series sweep. UCSB is also 4-2 on the road. As for Tulane, it too has had a hot start to the year as it boasts a 10-3 overall mark and is an excellent 7-2 at home. The Green Wave have also won four of their last five ballgames. For UCSB, it started the season all about offense. In its first seven games of the year, Santa Barbara scored 65 runs for an average of 9.3 runs per game. Since then, however, the run total has slowed down as the Gauchos have mustered just 3.3 runs per contest. The important thing though, UCSB still won all three of its games thanks to some great pitching performances. Against USC on Tuesday, Feb. 26, sophomore Jack Dashwood was absolutely spectacular. The San Diego native took a no-hitter into the seventh inning and struck out a career-high 10 batters while earning the win in a 2-1 victory over the Trojans. Overall, Dashwood allowed just one run on two hits. His 10 K's were also the most by a Gaucho pitcher since Noah Davis struck out 10 against Tulane back in 2017. This performance helped the sophomore earn his first career Big West Pitcher of the Week honor. On March 1, Ben Brecht, the junior southpaw who figures to be the Friday starter this week, also had a terrific performance tossing 6.1 innings five hits, two runs while striking out nine. If you could imagine, the key difference in the pitching staff this year for UCSB has been the strikeouts. Through the first 10 games last year, Santa Barbara's staff had 84 strikeouts. This year it already has 104. As a staff, Santa Barbara also hasn't allowed too many walks with just 26 base on balls. It also helps that while the starters are getting the job done, so are the relievers. Junior righty Chris Lincoln comes to mind when UCSB needs to get out of a jam. The Moreno Valley, Calif. native has four saves on the year already allowing just nine hits and three runs in 10.2 innings pitched. He has also struck out 10 batters. Still, UCSB will have some tough opposition this week in Tulane. Junior Kody Hoese †slashes .404/.455/.754 this season with 16 RBI's. Hoese is the only batter with a plus .400 average. Even scarier, four of the Green Waves everyday starters also bat above .300 including Jonathon Artigues who leads the team in RBI's with 17. Senior infielder Trevor Jensen bats .386 with a team-high six doubles. As for UCSB, while its offense has hit a bit of a bump, it still is dominating. As a team, the Gauchos bat .268 while slugging .471 and holding an on-base percentage of .367. Their 13 home runs are tied for 17th for the most in the nation. Juniors Eric Yang and Tommy Jew have been some of the more consistent bats this season. Yang leads the team in batting average hitting .447 and has knocked in the most runs with 12. The catcher's .678 slugging percentage also ranks third on the team. As for Jew, the center fielder has been great as expected on the defensive end and as the leadoff hitter he has done well batting .268. Where he shines is his slugging which is .762, the best mark on the team. His four home runs also lead the team. Overall, Santa Barbara has some steep competition when it travels to Louisiana, but it also has some momentum. The last two years through 10 games, Santa Barbara was just 4-6 in both seasons. Being 8-2 this year certainly is a sign that this is a new team. Even if the Gauchos do not complete a sweep and win nine straight once the series is over, a road series victory would be a huge boost for confidence. UCSB faces Tulane at 4:30 p.m. pacific time on Friday, March 8 at Turchin Stadium. Saturday's match will be noon pacific while Sunday's will be at 11 a.m. pacific with both matches being played at the same location.

sports,Gauchos Seek Longest Win-Streak Since 1980,7-Mar-19,5:25 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/gauchos-seek-longest-win-streak-since-1980/,"Allison Fann / Daily Nexus Winners of 11 straight, the No. 4 UCSB men's volleyball team has come a long way this season and before it has a showdown with the No. 1 team in the nation next week in Long Beach State it must first not lose focus on its opponent this week, unranked Lindenwood. Currently, Santa Barbara boasts a 14-3 overall record and, with two wins against UC San Diego, it also has a 2-0 conference record. As it prepares to host Lindenwood, who is 7-11 overall, 3-5 †in conference, UCSB also has a 9-1 record at Rob Gym.  In their previous outing, the Gauchos were efficient all evening, hitting .400 (37-11-65) as a team while their opponent, UCSD, hit just .162 (23-12-68). Additionally, in that match, freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox led the night with 10 kills. For UCSB, this will be the first time it ever faces off against the Lindenwood program. However, against similar opponents, Lindenwood is 1-8 with its only win coming against Ohio State, a team UCSB lit up and swept.  Additionally, no one is really excited to play Santa Barbara right now. On top of being winners of 11 straight, seven of those victories have come against AVCA Top-15 competition. Also, a win on Friday for UCSB would give them its longest win streak since 1980. In fact, of the 12 Top-15 teams Santa Barbara has faced, it has gone 9-3 in those games. UCSB has the toughest schedule in the nation when looking at its cumulative opposition, currently holding a 252-140 overall record. Down the stretch, the Gauchos also have the toughest schedule in the nation, facing No. 1 LBSU, No. 2 Hawaii and No. 3 UC Irvine ranked teams in its remaining conference play.  A big part for UCSB success this season has been because of senior outside hitter Corey Chavers. For the season, he leads the team by far with 236 kills (3.75 k/s) and 32 service aces. Additionally, Chavers is also among the team leaders in digs (66) and total blocks (32). Chavers has also accumulated three Big West Player of the Week honors this season and has had three matches with over 20 kills.  Another big reason for the Gauchos' success is the collection of freshmen that continue to thrive as the season continues. The aforementioned Wilcox has been arguably the best of the bunch earning three Big West Freshman Player of the Week honors. There have only been nine handed out this season. This season, the outside hitter has reach the double-digit kill total six times and in this 11-game stretch, he has averaged just over nine kills a game much better than his 6.4 kills per game during the first six games of the year. He is second on the team in total kills with 132. As for other freshman, Brandon Hicks has also been impressive. He too has earned a Big West Freshman Player of the Week honor and has played well on the defensive end for the Gauchos as the middle blocker leads the team in blocks with 54. In terms of their competition, the Lions have been having an up and down season. Since starting the year 2-6, Lindenwood has won five of its last 10 to be at a steady record but it still has a lot of work to be done.  Where the Lions have struggled most this season has been limiting their opponents offensive opportunities. Currently, opponents average a .261 attack percentage and earn 11 kills per set. As a team, UCSB hits .326 for the season and earns nearly 12 kills per set. The Lions do have three players with more than 100 kills led by junior opposite hitter Charley Hlavin who has 167. His running mate, Nick Stevenson, is tied for second on the team in kills with 129. Unfortunately, the two combined only shoot a .171 attack percentage.  Overall, this weekend is key for the Gauchos in the sense they cannot get ahead of themselves. It would be easy to overlook a team like Lindenwood, a team UCSB could beat easy. But it shouldn't. Santa Barbara has a lot of key matches up ahead, especially next week, but the only one that matters right now is unranked Lindenwood. UCSB takes on Lindenwood at 7 p.m. on Friday, March 8 at Rob Gym. † Comments are closed.

sports,Men's Basketball Looks To Gain Steam Before Big West Tourney,7-Mar-19,3:25 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/mens-basketball-looks-to-gain-steam-before-big-west-tourney/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus The men's basketball team is back on the road this week, as the Gauchos prepare for their last Big West doubleheader and pair of regular season matches. First, they'll travel south to Northridge, where UCSB will face off against CSUN. Next, another installment of the Blue-Green rivalry is in store as the team travels north to Cal Poly this weekend. Last week was full of emotion as Gaucho seniors Ar'mond Davis, Ami Lakoju, Jarriesse Blackmon and Maxwell Kupchak were all honored at the Thunderdome's Senior Night, last Thursday. UCSB was looking to do the double over Long Beach State, whom they had bested on the road about a month prior. Unfortunately, the seniors weren't able to be sent off on a win as the Gauchos fell just short by a score of 69-64. Still, fans and players alike applauded the seniors' contributions throughout their time here at Santa Barbara. As it stands, the Gauchos hold an overall record of 19-9 on the season, equaling a win percentage of .679. With men's basketball for the month of February now in the books, UCSB finished with an evenly split performance of 4-4 through the eight Big West Conference matchups they faced. With the postseason's Big West Tournament just on the horizon, seeding could still be shaken up as the standings still remain unsecure. Following last week's play, UC Irvine have now locked in their place as Big West Conference regular season champions. However, the Gauchos still have a shot at second place in the league if results go in their favor. Cal State Fullerton, whom the Gauchos beat at their home but lost to at the Thunderdome earlier in the season, currently holds second overall with a conference record of 10-5. Meanwhile, the Gauchos remain in third with an 8-6 conference record of their own, although a top-three finish isn't guaranteed for Santa Barbara as Hawaii, CSUN, UC Davis and Long Beach State all trail closely behind by only a single win difference. Thursday's opponents in CSUN are in fine form, as the Matadors are in the midst of a win streak. After losing away at Long Beach State by just a bucket a couple of weeks ago, CSUN has since gone back-to- back-to-back with a trio of wins against UC Davis, UC Riverside and Hawaii. The Matadors still hold an overall record of 13-17 on the season, a .433 win percentage, but they'll still be hungry to move up the conference ladder come game time. Historically speaking, the Gauchos lead the two teams' all-time series at a record of 38-19, with the last meeting resulting in a 70-64 home victory for UCSB early last month. As for Blue-Green rival Cal Poly, the Mustangs have been looking the worse for wear as of late. With a 6-21 overall record on the season, Cal Poly also stands dead last in Big West standings with a conference record of 2-12. Not to mention, they've averaged 1.5 wins in every month of play this season. The Mustangs will be coming off a most recent 94-85 road loss to Long Beach State, as UCSB will want to complete the clean sweep over their rivals this weekend. This will be the 115th time the Gauchos have faced their familiar foes, as UCSB leads the all-time series at a record of 79-35. Last time out also resulted in a Gaucho win as UCSB opened this season's conference campaign with a 65-56 home win over Cal Poly. Freshman forward Amadou Sow is this week's player to watch for the Gauchos. Sow will be coming off a most recent monster performance against Long Beach State, where his stat line ended at 13 points, 15 rebounds, three blocks and a pair of assists. With a great combination of height and strength, Sow's added agility also makes him an excellent rim protector that enemy teams must script against. Two great forces will act opposite of each other as the Matadors also boast a big man prospect of their own in freshman forward Lamine Diane. Leading in total scoring for his side, Diane is also a block machine with 63 on the season. In addition, his 313 total rebounds make up almost a third of his team's total rebounds; it'll be wise for the Gauchos to not allow Diane his normal defensive production following tipoff. Once more, senior point guard Donovan Fields remains one of the few bright spots on Cal Poly's season. Fields's total of 451 points and 109 assists leads the Mustangs for the season. As the major driving force of Cal Poly's offensive production, shutting Fields down will be key for another Gaucho win in the Blue-Green rivalry. All the action starts this Thursday, March 7, as UCSB heads south to CSUN for a 7 p.m. tipoff time. Then the Gauchos will head north to Cal Poly this Saturday, March 9, which is also set to begin at 7 p.m. A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the March 7, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,UCSB Aims To Upset Davis in Regular Season Finale,7-Mar-19,5:23 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-07/ucsb-aims-to-upset-davis-in-regular-season-finale/,"Leonard Paulasa/Daily Nexus Riding its first win streak of the season, the UCSB women's basketball team will look to finish their season on a high-note when they travel to take on UC Davis on Saturday. With their 61-44 victory over UC Riverside this past week, the Gauchos clinched a spot in the Big West Tournament ""î something that looked almost impossible at the beginning of conference play. If Santa Barbara can knock off the Aggies, they could finish as high as seventh in the conference, depending on Long Beach's results during the week. Getting a positive result against top-dog UC Davis will be no walk in the park, however. After losing the second game of conference play, the Aggies have won 12 straight games in conference play en-route to their 13-1 conference record. Impressively, every single one of those wins have been by double digits ""î including their 70-44 thrashing of UCSB at the Thunderdome. UCSB's recent success has been predicated on their lockdown defense; in both games last week, the Gauchos held their opponents to fewer than 50 points. In the victory over Riverside, Santa Barbara held the Highlanders to a measly 34 percent shooting, also forcing 14 turnovers. Another catalyst for the resurgent play of UCSB has been the backcourt duo of Coco and Danae Miller ""î with their best games consistently coinciding with the Gauchos' success. In the Riverside game, the duo combined for 34 points, 13 assists and only three turnovers, as well as chipping in five steals on the defensive end. Conversely, in the previous meeting between Davis and SB, the duo merely combined for 13 points and three assists in the blowout loss. As has been the case all season, Davis' offense starts and ends with senior star Morgan Bertsch, who currently ranks fourth in the entire nation with 23.9 points per game. With smooth footwork in the post and a silky jump shot that opponents are forced to respect, Bertsch has consistently been the top player in the conference all season. In the first matchup between these sides, Bertsch dropped in 27 points on an efficient 10-18 performance from the floor, also adding in seven rebounds for good measure. Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson tried different matchups against Bertsch throughout the game, but no one could successfully slow her down. It will be interesting to see how Henrickson handles Bertsch this time around; known for her basketball acumen and ability to make adjustments, Henrickson may opt to double Bertsch and keep the ball out of her hands completely this time around. While no no one else has the individual impact that Bertsch does, Davis has a wide array of weapons who have proven to be efficient scorers this season. With her deft handles and smart decision-making, point guard Kourtney Eaton has successfully orchestrated the offense all season. Despite averaging only 20 minutes per game, forward Nina Bessolo averages 9.3 points per game, with Bessolo often able to exploit the space cleared by Bertsch on the offensive end. Given the individual excellence of Bertsch and the weapons around her, it's a near impossible task to completely stop Davis on defense. If the Gauchos are to have a chance against the Aggies, they will need to improve their efficiency and finishing on the offensive end. Despite their recent success, Santa Barbara is only averaging 55 points per game in their last four games; for comparison's sake, the Aggies haven't scored below 60 points in any conference game this season. In that first matchup against Davis, UCSB shot only 24 percent from the floor, only hitting four of their 23 attempted threes for the game. That number will need to rise dramatically if Santa Barbara wants to pull off the biggest upset of Big West play. With a spot in the postseason already clinched, there is certainly less pressure on UCSB in what should be a difficult game. Still, a good performance on Saturday would do wonders for the Gauchos' confidence heading into the conference tournament. UCSB will take on UC Davis on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. at the Pavillion.

sports,Gauchos Hold Off Green Wave To Earn 7th-Straight Win,8-Mar-19,11:27 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-08/gauchos-hold-off-green-wave-to-earn-7th-straight-win/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus The UCSB baseball team pounced on Tulane early in Friday's non-conference tilt jumping out to a 7-0 lead and despite a great effort from the Green Waves, the Gauchos held them off to earn a 7-4 win. With the victory, Santa Barbara has now won seven straight matches and improves to 9-2 overall. As for the home team, Tulane drops to 10-4 and has now lost two of its last three games for the second time this season. The Gauchos had its best offensive performance since its 14-0 win against Hartford with its seven runs on 11 hits. On the mound, junior lefty Ben Brecht was also spectacular for the majority of the night. Both teams were tied at zero heading into the third when the UCSB hitting took off. A single from senior Tevin Mitchell followed by a double from junior Tommy Jew gave the Gauchos runners on second and third. Sophomore infielder Andrew Martinez then brought in the first run of the evening with a sac fly. After back-to-back walks, UCSB had the bases loaded for junior Armani Smith who singled right up the gut to bring in two runs and give his team a 3-0 lead. A big hit for the outfielder as he was 0-10 in his previous three games. Santa Barbara proceeded to keep the pressure adding two more in the fourth, one in the fifth and one in the sixth to give them a 7-0 lead. Jew, who had his sixth multiple-hit night of the year going 3-6, added two of those four runs with RBI singles in the fourth and fifth while junior catcher Eric Yang earned his team-high 13th RBI of the year with a single in the fourth as well. On the day, four UCSB batters would go on to earn multiple hits in the contest. While the offense was finding its groove, Brecht was pitching a gem. Tulane had one hit in both the first and second innings. After that, the UCSB southpaw shut them down retiring at one point 16 straight batters spanning from the second to the seventh inning. In that time, Brecht also struck out a career-high 11 Green Waves adding to UCSB's Big West-leading†10.86 K's per nine innings. Of course, the hard thing for any coach is knowing when to retire a pitcher with a hot hand. And the Gauchos might have waited a bit too long as in the eighth inning fatigue caught up to Brecht. After walking the first batter, Brecht got next batter to fly out and everything looked like it would be okay. That was until Tulane's Kobi Owen crushed his first home-run of the year to bring his team within five. After the home run, Brecht was replaced by junior lefty Liam Steigerwald who also struggled. Brecht finished the evening allowing three hits, two runs while walking two in 7.1 innings. After getting his first batter to ground out, Steigerwald gave up a single then†another moon shot, this time by Tulane's best hitter junior Kody Hoese, bringing the score to 7-4. From there, however, freshman standout Michael McGreevy came in for his sixth appearance of the season and was spectacular not allowing for any hint of drama as he retired all four batters he faced, two of them being strikeouts, to earn the first save of his career. In his limited experience, McGreevy has proven has proven himself to be a reliable arm out of the pen allowing just nine hits and one run in his 13.1 innings pitched. He has also struck out 15 batters. Ultimately, UCSB's win on Friday showcased the immense talent it has on both sides of the field. However, it also showcased the Gauchos not taking full advantage of their opportunities†as they left 15 batters on base. They also struck out a total of 14 times, but, they did enough to earn a hard-fought road win. Those are always hard to come by and they are good to pick up in the early parts of the year. UCSB will continue its series against Tulane at noon on Saturday, March 9 at Turchin Stadium.

sports,Heidegger's Dagger Downs CSUN,8-Mar-19,12:48 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-08/heideggers-dagger-downs-csun/,"Pre-game introductions in front of an excited UCSB crowd. Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus With 3.8 seconds to play, star junior guard Max Heidegger drilled a flamethrower three from 30 feet out to take the lead and propel the UCSB men's basketball team over the CSUN Matadors with a 76-74 win in crunch time.  Not only did he deliver the game-winner, but in his third season with the Gauchos, Heidegger reached the 1,000 career-point milestone within the first minute of action. He became the 29th Gaucho in program history to reach that feat and moved into 28th place on the all-time Gaucho scoring list. † Heidegger produced 23 points, eight rebounds, three assists and one dagger jumper in the win over Northridge to move the Gauchos within one game of second place in the Big West with a 9-6 conference record, 20-9 overall.  On a night in which CSUN's redshirt freshman forward Lamine Diane posted 34 points and 13 rebounds, it was Heidegger and the Gauchos who had the last laugh. In the last meeting between these two teams, CSUN started off on an 11-0 run to burst out of the gates, but Head Coach Joe Pasternack had different plans in mind the second time around.  Santa Barbara opened up with a quick 7-2 run just minutes into the game as it looked to take an early lead over Northridge and set the tone immediately. The Matadors swiftly retaliated with a 10-0 run of their own with production from the two top scorers in the Big West Conference in Diane and sophomore guard Terrell Gomez who combined to account for all of CSUN's first 12 points. Diane, currently ranked No. 4 on CBS's Frosh Watch list, is on pace to become the first player in Big West Conference history to win both Freshman of the Year and Player of the Year in the same season while averaging 24.5 points and nearly 11 rebounds.  The Senegal native is one of only two freshmen in the country averaging a double-double, and neither of them are named Zion or RJ. Gomez ""î the Big West's reigning Freshman of the Year ""î and Diane are the cornerstones in this uncommonly concentrated Matador offense. The pair of young stars combined for 20 of the 26 field goals CSUN made all game.  The Gauchos found themselves down 19-11 with 12:33 in the first after Gomez opened up shooting 3-5 from beyond the arc. However, Heidegger came alive to lead the comeback. With a seven-point tear of his own, the junior vaulted SB into the lead with 15 first-half points to ultimately close out on a six-to-nothing swing for UCSB and take a 44-38 lead into halftime.  Pasternack stormed off the floor heading into the break unhappy with the final possession, but come second half, the Gauchos were locked in. Gritty play from UCSB inflated the lead to 58-46 with 12:34 in the second after a put-back tip-in from sophomore forward Robinson Idehen who added 13 meaningful minutes off the bench with six points on 3-4 from the field and five rebounds on top of a stout defensive performance throughout. Down by 12, Diane and Gomez caught fire and led a hearty comeback of their own with help from junior guard Rodney Henderson, Jr., who hit three blast-off triples within the span of four minutes to take the lead 68-66 with five on the clock. Henderson's three makes from deep were the Matadors' only points in the second half that weren't contributed by either Gomez or Diane. CSUN remained on top, but a Heidegger trey pulled the Gauchos within 72-71 with 90 seconds to play.  Freshman forward Amadou Sow made the most of a trip to the line and knocked down a pair of big-time free throws to put UCSB back on top, but a foul on Gomez caused another lead change in favor of CSUN who found itself in the lead, 74-73, sparing just 30.1 seconds. UCSB had a full possession to scheme up the right attack, and after moving it around the horn, graduate guard Ar'mond Davis drove to the rack but came up short on a lay-in. A loose ball was tipped up and sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin made an incredible hustle play to leap on the floor and save it before the ball rolled out of bounds.  With a second chance in store, Davis got the pass from McLaughlin fired out to Heidegger who released a desperation three in no-man's-land and absolutely stuck the landing to deliver the win for UCSB.  You can run, but you can't Heid. Max Heidegger had the Superman ""úS""ù on his chest with his late game heroics, and the Gauchos held off CSUN 76-74 in the epitome of a late-game thriller. For the final game of the regular season, the UCSB men's basketball team heads to San Luis Obispo to take on the 2-14 Cal Poly Mustangs for another chapter of the Blue-Green Rivalry on Saturday, March 9 at 7 p.m. in Mott Athletic Center.

sports,No. 4 UCSB Tames Lindenwood Lions to Attain 12th-Consecutive Win,8-Mar-19,11:00 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-08/no-4-ucsb-tames-lindenwood-lions-to-attain-12th-consecutive-win/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus Coming into the night, the No. 4 UCSB men's volleyball team had a lot to gain but a lot to lose. However, it rose to the challenge, and Santa Barbara came up with its 12th-straight win in its final non-conference tilt of the season defeating unranked Lindenwood 3-1 with set scores of†25-16, 25-14, 20-25, 25-20. The victory gives the Gauchos its longest win streak since 1980 and they also improve to 15-3 on the year, more specifically†10-1 at home. Lindenwood, who to its credit is one of six teams to take a set from UCSB during its 12-game run, falls to 7-12 on the year and has now lost three-straight contests. Looking at the stats, however, one would probably not be able to imagine how the Lions were able to win a set. For the night, Santa Barbara shot just a mediocre .248 shot percentage but in the first two sets was especially dominant. As a team it also had an impressive eight service aces, three of which came courtesy of Keenan Sanders. It also held Lindenwood to a much worse .68 mark on Friday. Freshman Ryan Wilcox again paced the offense for the Gauchos earning a match-high 11 kills. This marks the third time in the last four matches that Wilcox has had double-digit kills. In the first set, UCSB took control after the match was tied at 5-5. The Gauchos would go onto five of the next six points to take a 10-6 lead. At 14-10, UCSB would finish off the set on an 11-6 run to win 25-16. In the first, it was a very evenly paced match for Santa Barbara. Both Wilcox and junior opposite Fredrick Spencer had four kills with Wilcox also having an ace. Spencer had a great night himself earning a double-double with 10 kills and 10 digs. Defensively, freshman Brandon Hicks also played well totaling a team high four blocks to go with nine kills. In the second, it was more of Lindenwood's mistakes that allowed UCSB to coast to another easy win at 25-14. The Lions had nine errors and show -.111 compared to the Gauchos .318 shot percentage. The third set saw the roles completely reverse, however, as Lindenwood shot .267 and had a team-high 13 kills on the night. The team jumped out to an 8-4 lead and really never looked back. In that set, Junior Connor Hipelius was the leader for of the pack for the Lions tallying four kills. The middle blocker led the team with eight kills, six blocks and a .667 hitting percentage while sophomore teammate Michael Jennings also recorded eight kills and added in five digs. For the most part, even in the fourth set, Lindenwood played better. After taking a 2-0 deficit to the break, the Lions responded to hold the Gauchos to .111 and .136 attack percentages in the third and fourth sets, respectively. However, the fourth set saw Lindenwood have many of the same problems as it did in the second. The Lions had 10 errors in the set and shot -.38 as the Gauchos took the last set pretty easy 25-20. Senior outside hitter Corey Chavers, who for the second straight match did not have double-digit kills,†finished with nine strikes, five digs and three total blocks. And, for the fourth-straight match, junior setter Casey McGarry had over 30 assists totaling 33, a team high. With the win, UCSB got past the opponent it should have beat. Now, it will turn its attention to the toughest team in the country, No. 1 Long Beach State. 12 straight wins is impressive, especially considering the teams Santa Barbara has beaten along the way, but a 13th straight win would go a long way in helping UCSB show that it is for real. The Big West Conference currently houses the four top teams in the country according to ranking. League play is now in full effect so everyone will see who are the pretenders and who are the ones that will compete for a national title. UCSB's next match is at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 14 at No. 1 Long Beach State. Comments are closed.

Angie Banks / Daily Nexus For the second consecutive season with Head Coach Joe Pasternack at the reigns, the UCSB men's basketball team will prepare for the Big West Tournament as the second-seed after securing the two-spot with a 92-82 win over Cal Poly on Saturday evening. The Gauchos are 21-9 with a 10-6 Big West record and swept this season's installments of the Blue-Green Rivalry against the Cal Poly Mustangs who finished the season in last place and missed the Big West Tournament for the first time since 2009 when it went 7-21.  Leading the charge as he's done all season, freshman phenom Amadou Sow posted a career-high 23 points while shooting a perfect 9-9 from the field. During the win, Sow eclipsed 361 points this season to become the highest scoring freshman in UCSB history, a record that was previously held by Chris Devine from the 2006 season.  On top of that, Sow is just three buckets away from scoring the most field goals by a Gaucho freshman in a single season and is on pace to become the most efficient UCSB freshman with a 57.7 percent field goal percentage. Although Sow's historic night was highlighted in the win, Ar'mond Davis put an exclamation point on his final regular season collegiate basketball game with a career-high 17 rebounds to go along with 13 points. On the other side of the ball, senior Donovan Fields ended his collegiate career with a 23-point night and became the first player in Cal Poly history with 1,000 career-points, 300 assists and 100 steals.  The Mustangs burst out the gates behind senior Kuba Niziol who quickly added eight of the first 12 points for Cal Poly, but once the lead hit 16-15, the Gauchos roared back.  SB powered back with an 18-9 run capped off by a Max Heidegger three-pointer to extend the lead to 33-25 with 8:34 to play in the first, and the Gauchos looked to tack on more as the half came to a close.  Eclectic scoring extended the Gaucho lead to 50-38 heading into the half-time break as Heidegger led the way with 11 at the end of one. Ar'mond Davis was close behind with eight points and eight rebounds after the half.  The second half was more of the same as UCSB continued to pressure the Mustangs with penetration in the post. Sow caught fire in the second half with his muscle in the paint and with a six-point tear and 12 minutes left on the clock, UCSB notched its largest lead of the night with a 69-52 advantage over its rival Cal Poly. The freshman's perfect night of field goals is the ideal way to culminate arguably the best regular season a freshman has ever had wearing the Gaucho gold and blue. The Mali †native is first in the Big West Conference in field goal percentage and looks to lead UCSB to its first conference title since 2011. Santa Barbara made the leap from third seed to second seed with the win paired with a loss by Cal State Fullerton at Hawai'i on Saturday night. Fullerton swapped spots with UCSB heading into the tournament while the Gauchos are full steam ahead with one goal in mind.  The first obstacle in the Gauchos' way? Lamine Diane and Cal State Northridge. UCSB knocked off CSUN in a thriller in its penultimate regular season game as Max Heidegger spoiled senior night for the Matadors with a last second triple to buck the bull riders and put a blemish on a 34-point, 13-rebound night from Diane, one of the top freshmen in the country. The Big West Tournament kicks off with the two-seeded Gauchos who take on the seven-seeded Matadors at 12 p.m. on Thursday, March 14 at the Honda Center in Anaheim Calif. with what's sure to be a firework show from a pair of explosive offenses.

sports,UCSB Hopes to Defy Odds Heading Into Big West Tournament,11-Mar-19,7:28 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-11/ucsb-hopes-to-defy-odds-heading-into-big-west-tournament/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus After an up-and-down regular season, the UCSB women's basketball team will head to the Honda Center to take on UC Irvine tomorrow in the first round of the Big West Tournament.  For Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the Gauchos (8-21, 5-11), just making it to the tournament feels like a victory in and of itself. Despite starting conference play with a 1-7 record, Santa Barbara never quit on the season, winning four of their last eight conference games to secure the eighth and final seed in the tournament. ""úOur team kept coming every day with a great attitude and effort,""ù Henrickson said. ""úI'm proud of the group for our resolve and resilience.""ù If the Gauchos are to keep their season alive, they will have to win four consecutive games in five days, starting with tomorrow's matchup with the fifth-seeded Anteaters. Unlike Santa Barbara, UC Irvine (18-10, 8-8) has limped into postseason play after losing five of their last seven games ""î with the first of those losses a 71-52 blowout defeat at the hands of UCSB. Perhaps the biggest factor in Tuesday's matchup will be the health of Irvine's star forward, Jordan Sanders. Averaging more than 20 points per game on the season, the First Team All-Big West sophomore has missed the team's last three games with an ankle sprain. In those games, Irvine's offense has been completely out of sorts, with the team only scoring 56 points per game. On Monday, Irvine's Head Coach Tamara Inoue acknowledged that Sanders' status is still uncertain heading into Tuesday's matchup with SB. If Sanders doesn't play, the Anteaters scoring load will fall to the backcourt duo of Lauren Saiki and Andee Ritter. While Saiki has been inconsistent at times this year, her 12.1 points per game rank second on the team, while she leads the squad with 127 assists on the season. Defensively, Saiki is the engine behind Irvine's vaunted full-court press ""î a press that has generated almost 21 turnovers per game. More of an off-ball guard, Ritter's shooting makes her a constant threat on the offensive end. Even amidst a recent cold stretch from deep, Ritter leads the team with 52 made three's on the year. For the Gauchos, Henrickson will look to lean on the backcourt duo of Second Team All-Big West guard Coco Miller and All-Big West Honorable Mention Danae Miller for the team's offensive production.  In the Gauchos' drubbing of Irvine in February, those two combined for 41 points, 9 assists and, perhaps most impressively, only four turnovers despite a constant full-court press from Irvine. ""úWe've asked [Coco and Danae] to do a lot for us this year,""ù Henrickson said. ""úDanae has stepped into a scoring role, and Coco's leadership and consistency has led us all year. Both of them have an incredibly high basketball IQ.""ù Outside of the backcourt, Santa Barbara also looks to feed the ball inside to junior center Natalia Bruening. While only playing 24 minutes per game, Bruening has chipped in almost 10 points and six rebounds per game. If Sanders can't play, Bruening should have even more space to operate in the post. While the odds may be against Santa Barbara to make an almost improbable run in the tournament, they can be inspired by the success of Cal State Northridge last season. Despite being the fifth seed and having to play on Tuesday, Northridge won four games in five days to secure the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. On the Big West tournament conference call on Monday, Henrickson discussed the rich history of the Gauchos' program ""î a program that has won this very tournament 14 times in the past. While Santa Barbara may be the lowest-seeded team in the field, they have proven over and over again this season that they will not go down without a fight. If the cards fall the right way, don't put it past UCSB to make a deep run in the tournament. The Gauchos will kick-off their postseason play against Irvine on Tuesday at the Honda center, with tip-off slated for 6 p.m.

sports,Gauchos Fall Short in Big West Tournament Opener,13-Mar-19,11:10 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-13/gauchos-fall-short-in-big-west-tournament-opener/," Despite a valiant comeback in the fourth quarter, the UCSB women's basketball team's season ended on Tuesday night when it fell to UC Irvine in the first round of the Big West Tournament, 53-46. Yet again, a slow start and a poor shooting night proved to be the Gauchos' kryptonite. The Anteaters outscored Santa Barbara 18-8 in the first quarter and would never look back, holding the lead for the rest of the game. ""úWe've struggled all year getting off to bad starts,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úIt's hard to win games in the 50s and 40s, so we need to be more committed to getting off to better starts.""ù In that eight-point first quarter, every single Gaucho starter was held scoreless, with junior Tal Sahar leading the bench unit with five points. Defensively, UCSB could do little to slow down Irvine's offense in the quarter. With leading scorer and First Team All-Big West forward Jordan Sanders back from a concussion, Irvine was able to space the floor better than it had recently. Senior guard Andee Ritter led the team with six points in the quarter ""î all from behind the arc ""î and junior guard Lauren Saiki pitched in four points and three assists. After that quarter, Santa Barbara's defense improved significantly, with UCSB holding Irvine to 15 points below its conference average on the season. Unfortunately, its offense remained as stagnant as it has been all season. For the game, Santa Barbara shot a measly 15-59 from the floor, including 3-25 from behind the arc. ""úWe know that for next year we have work to do offensively,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWhen we only shoot 25 percent, we know we have to knock down shots.""ù Despite the rough shooting night for the team, junior center Natalia Bruening played one of her best individual games of the season. With nothing working on the perimeter, the ""òChos looked to feed the big inside, and Bruening responded with 16 points and 12 rebounds. Just as importantly, Bruening stayed out of foul trouble on Tuesday, allowing her to play 34 minutes in the crucial game. By running its offense through Bruening, UCSB was able to go on a late run, cutting the lead down to only five points with 1:16 left in the game. Still, it was not to be for the eighth-seed Gauchos on Tuesday, with guards Coco Miller and Kiana Vierra both missing open threes that could have brought the deficit all the way down to two. While her shooting was spotty throughout the night, Sanders' return proved to be the difference for Irvine, with the star forward making both her free throws and grabbing five rebounds in the fourth quarter to secure the victory for the Anteaters. UCI will look to keep its season going on Wednesday when it takes on defending tournament champions CSUN at 8:30 p.m. For the Gauchos, Tuesday's loss marks the end of a volatile season filled with struggles, especially on the offensive end. Still, at the postgame presser on Tuesday, Henrickson hailed the spirit of her young team. ""úWe could've given up on the season after starting conference play 1-7, but these kids never gave up,""ù Henrickson said. ""úThey were coachable the whole season.""ù Coco Miller also praised the effort of her team on the season, citing their continued belief and battling as progress. ""úIn the beginning of the season, we got down as a group when the other team went on runs, and we'd get even more down,""ù she said. ""úTowards the end of the season, we started going on our own runs, and they got longer and longer as the season went on.""ù With only one graduating senior, Henrickson will bring back almost all of her weapons for next season. After a whole year of experience under their belt, this group will be looking to grow and come back stronger than ever next season. Comments are closed.

The team will travel to the Honda Center in Anaheim, Calif., where they will look to take on the CSUN Matadors, whom they visited only seven days before. The Gauchos will be entering the postseason in fine form considering last week's results away from home. For the team's final two matchups of the regular season, UCSB traveled to Northridge and Cal Poly last week for a pair of away games. In turn, the on-fire Gauchos posted back-to-back road wins, during which a clutch three-pointer bested the Matadors by a score of 76-74 and another triumphant Blue-Green rivalry performance featured the good guys defeating the Mustangs by a 92-82 result. Following these results, and the previous conference home win that occurred in early February, UCSB has successfully done the double over CSUN. Although the Matadors finished as the Big West's seventh seed, they have managed close affairs each time they've shared a court with UCSB. Regardless, the Gauchos will look to carry their current momentum en route to a desired hat trick of victories. As it stands, the Gauchos can conclude that their regular season was, for the most part, a success. UCSB currently boasts an overall record of 21-9, an exact win percentage of .700. In terms of conference play, the Gauchos' 10-6 record proved challenging yet equally rewarding, as the team managed a favorable second seed finish in the conference. As for Thursday's opponent, CSUN can't boast similarly favorable results, in regard to its regular season campaign. The Matadors finished with an overall record of 13-19, equaling a win percentage of .406, and a conference record of 7-9 that seeds them as seventh in the Big West. Entering this postseason matchup, the Matadors will have to dig deep, especially since they'll be coming off of last week's back-to-back losses against UCSB and first-seed UC Irvine. Their recent results, however, reflect their dip in form since February, in which they've managed only four wins in their last 10 games. Historically, the Gauchos lead the all-time series against the Matadors by a record of 39-19. This will be the 59th time that UCSB has ever played CSUN, and there will be no love lost between the two sides since the Gauchos also managed a clean sweep over the Matadors in last season's campaign. Players to watch, for the Gauchos, include junior guard Max Heidegger and freshman forward Amadou Sow. Heidegger seemingly loves to play in these matchups considering he's averaged a whopping 24.5 points and six rebounds when playing against CSUN. Meanwhile, Sow will want to capitalize on his spectacular rookie season by continuing to put on a great show through the postseason. Against CSUN, Sow has twice managed double-digit performances, showing his versatility as a player who can both protect the rim and score at will. ""úWhenever you lose an all-league first-teamer, it was very difficult to figure out where we were going to score from,""ù UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack responded when asked about the impact of Heidegger's injury-related absence during the earlier parts of the season. ""úSow is as consistent of a freshman that I've ever coached,""ù Pasternack added, ""ú[he] honors the process every day.""ù On the Matadors' end, only one player managed better scoring numbers than Heidegger through these two bouts: freshman forward Lamine Diane. Averaging a game-leading 31 points against the Gauchos, Diane also tallied 13 rebounds last time out. CSUN's sophomore guard Terrell Gomez also appears to be at the helm of Matador production, as Gomez has notched two double-digit performances against UCSB. The Gauchos should now be familiar with this high-octane tandem, and limiting what these two can do with the ball should be a priority. ""úCSUN is the only team with two players on first team all-conference,""ù Pasternack said before calling Matadors' Mark Gottfried a ""úterrific""ù head coach. Tipoff time is set for 12 p.m. this Thursday, March 14, as UCSB is set to face off against CSUN in the Big West Tournament Quarterfinals.  ††

sports,UCSB Hangs on in First Round Thriller,14-Mar-19,8:28 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-14/gauchos-hang-on-in-first-round-thriller/," In the opening round of the Big West Tournament, the UCSB men's basketball team held off a skillful CSUN Matadors squad with a 71-68 win †and will move on to live to see another day of the tournament.  Ar'mond Davis led Gaucho scorers with 19 points on 7-13 field goals while shooting 3-5 from deep with five rebounds with two steals and two blocks to put the win away in crunch time for UCSB. All five Gaucho starters had five or more rebounds to account for 34 of the 38 rebounds that UCSB corralled in the matchup.  ""úAt the end of the day, we're 17-4, we out-rebound our opponents and we out-rebounded them today,""ù Head Coach Joe Pasternack explained postgame. In the post, Amadou Sow posted 16 points and 11 rebounds for his fourth double-double of the season. Sow produced from the line for the majority of his points with a 7-8 clip on free throws. With four field goals in the Thursday afternoon contest, Sow added onto his already record-breaking freshman point total and also became the leader in single-season field goals by a Gaucho freshman.  CSUN has relied on concentrated scoring all year, but the ""òDors moved the ball around well with three players in double figures. Big West Conference Player of the Year Lamine Diane scored 22 points but was held to just 36 percent on field goals in his first career playoff game. Diane added 17 rebounds, seven blocks and three steals in the loss. The Matadors opened up on a 7-2 stretch as Diane bullied his way into the paint early, but the Gauchos powered back with an impressive run of their own.  UCSB capitalized on a 19-0 run to take a 28-14 lead with 8:45 left in the first as the ""òChos distributed the ball well to take control with six UCSB players getting into the scoring action during the momentum. First team Big West All-Conference honoree Terrell Gomez caught fire with eight of his 12 first half points in the final four-minute frame heading into the break to cut the lead to 42-34 after one.  The key for SB's big first was scrapping Diane who had just eight at the break on 3-9 shooting. The freshman often tallies double digits in the blink of an eye, so keeping him honest through one was huge for UCSB's confidence heading into the second.  ""úI thought our guys really positioned themselves well so wherever [Diane] went, he had a guy on each side of him,""ù Coach Pasternack said. ""úWe've been dialed in for the past three days on clogging the gaps and I thought we gave him a hard time tonight.""ù Diane woke up in the second for his monster night on the glass. Believe it or not, the 6-foot-7 forward's 17 rebounds was just his fourth-best rebounding performance in his freshman campaign. The bull riders took a 58-55 lead with 7:13 left in the second when Rodney Henderson Jr. delivered a double-take dagger from beyond the arc which seemingly shifted momentum once it sunk. ""úWe divide the game into 10 four-minute segments,""ù Pasternack added. ""úIt's not about the scoreboard, it's about winning that war, and that's what we were focused on doing.""ù Northridge held the advantage until Ar'mond Davis roared back with a five-point tear of his own to tie it up at 65 a piece with just over three minutes left.  From there, it was a battle of the free throws as UCSB's final six came from the stripe. The Gauchos survive another day and will face Cal State Fullerton at 9 p.m. in the Honda Center on Friday, March 15 in the second round in a meeting between the Big West's two and three seeds.

As it stands, the Gauchos will be taking on Cal State Fullerton in the next round of the Big West Tournament. News from around the league includes first-seed UC Irvine's dominant performance in its 63-44 win over UC Riverside. In addition, a lower seed upset also occurred as No. 5 Long Beach State just edged out No. 4 Hawaii after a close 68-66 win; per the Big West Tournament bracket layout, UC Irvine will be facing Long Beach State in the other semifinal match. UCSB's overall record on the season now improves to 22-9, only a win away from tying the team record for most wins in a single season. This same record was achieved by the men's basketball team just last season, as well as during the 2007-08 season's campaign. †† Coming off a big postseason win, the Gauchos are in inspired form that will hopefully carry them through the remainder of the Big West Tournament. As it was during their last encounter, UCSB versus CSUN once again went down to the wire. This time, however, the Gauchos managed to erase a 12-point deficit, late in the second half, as the team mounted a comeback win of 71-69. Cal State Fullerton, meanwhile, will be eyeing postseason glory as well as a .500 win percentage in this upcoming match versus UCSB. The Titans' overall record on the season now improves to 15-16, while their 10-6 conference record, the same as the Gauchos', seeds them as the No. 3 team in the Big West. Cal State Fullerton's quarterfinal matchup against UC Davis proved to be an overtime affair as the Titans earned their hard-fought win by a score of 75-71. This is the Titans' first win in the month of March, and they will be looking for a second if they hope to keep their season alive. The Gauchos split their two confrontations versus the Titans during the regular season, with a loss on the road before winning at the Thunderdome in late February. In terms of the history between these two sides, UCSB has the slight advantage in leading the all-time series by a record of 48-40. In UCSB's corner, sophomore guard JaQuori McLaughlin and graduate guard Ar'mond Davis will be the ones to watch for this upcoming postseason matchup. Gaucho Head Coach Joe Pasternack started off proceedings a bit differently in the quarterfinals by employing a starting five made up of four guards, instead of the normal three or two, and this paid off immensely. In their last game against CSUN, McLaughlin and Davis combined for 31 points, along with five rebounds apiece. Both players have played a significant role for the Gauchos all season long, and their presence in the postseason is a testament to the depth of UCSB's star-studded roster. On the Titan end, the usual catalysts of senior guards Khalil Ahmad and Kyle Allman Jr. were once again responsible for their team's success. Both the top two scorers for their team in terms of total points, Ahmad and Allman Jr. were the only Cal State Fullerton players to finish with double digits in scoring for the quarterfinal bout against UC Davis. It would be in UCSB's best interests to find a way to halt this dynamic duo's offensive production. † This installment of the Big West Tournament semifinals is shaping up to be an exciting one,† the second-seed Gauchos take on the third-seed Titans at the Honda Center this Friday, March 15, at 9 p.m.

For the second straight day, the Gauchos came up just short. In front of a packed and raucous home crowd on Friday, Santa Barbara took the first set off of defending national champions LBSU before dropping the next three sets en-route to a 3-1 defeat at the hands of the best team in the nation. For UCSB, junior Corey Chavers and freshman Spencer Fredrick paced the team with 16 kills a piece, while junior setter Casey McGarry led the way with 44 assists on the night. On Thursday, the No. 3 ranked Gauchos had taken the 49er's to five sets ""î the first team to do so this season ""î with LBSU ultimately taking the decisive set 15-11. Motivated by that near loss, Santa Barbara came out firing in the first set, racking up 24 kills on an impressive 47.6 percent kill percentage. To their credit, Long Beach hung around, matching the Gauchos point for point until the score was tied at 29. Then, UCSB's freshman phenoms took over. First, middle blocker Brandon Hicks slammed down a spike to give Santa Barbara the lead; on the subsequent point, Fredrick spiked an over-hit pass straight down to give the Gauchos the lead. But LBSU proved their resilience on Friday, battling back to take the second set 31-29. In large part, junior outside hitter and Team USA player TJ DeFalco dominated the set, spiking six of his 20 total kills. UCSB also made some crucial errors towards the end of the set, with Hicks missing a gamepoint serve and Fredrick committing an attack error that ultimately gave the set to LBSU. At that point, UCSB's fatigue seemed to set in, with the Gauchos getting hammered in the third set 25-14. After a plethora of mental errors, Santa Barbara fell behind early 11-4 and could never recover. Based in large part on subpar passing, the Gauchos could only get six kills during the entire set; excluding fifth sets, that mark would set a season low for UCSB. During the intermission between the third and fourth set, the 1400 people in admission did all they could to motivate Santa Barbara, and the Gauchos responded in the fourth set. After a missed served by LBSU, UCSB was up 24-21 in the fourth set, needing just one point to take the top team in the nation to a fifth set for the second straight day. After a kill by DeFalco, Long Beach setter Josh Tuaniga proved why he is one of the best players in the nation. Along with his 52 assists on the night, Tuaniga provided four straight aggressive serves that put the Gauchos under pressure. Behind his serving, LBSU went on a 4-0 run, coming all the way back to take the set 26-24 and subsequently winning the match. All night, Santa Barbara's unforced errors proved to be their Achilles' heel; in that fourth set, the Gauchos missed six serves. Against a lesser opponent, UCSB could have used their raw talent to win anyways, but against the defending champions those errors ultimately proved costly. Still, UCSB has plenty to hang their hat on. The Gauchos were able to give inarguably the best team in the nation a run for their money twice in two days, proving that UCSB can keep up with anyone in the nation. More importantly, a youthful Santa Barbara team was able to get crucial experience against an elite opponent ""î something that should help the Gauchos tremendously moving forward. UCSB will have next week off, before taking on Cal State Northridge at home on March 29.

sports,Gauchos Shut Down by Fullerton in Second Round,18-Mar-19,3:57 PM,['Max Kelton'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-18/gauchos-shut-down-by-fullerton-in-second-round/,"Pre-game introductions in front of an excited UCSB crowd. Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus For the second consecutive year, Head Coach Joe Pasternack's UCSB men's basketball team was bumped from the semifinals of the Big West Tournament with a 64-58 loss to Cal State Fullerton. The Gauchos finished the season with a 22-10 overall record as the second seed in the Big West Conference but couldn't get things done against Khalil Ahmad and the Titans. Ahmad posted 28 points on 9-14 shooting in addition to six rebounds, just a day after he erupted for 32 in the quarterfinals against UC Davis. Santa Barbara was led by 14 points from both Max Heidegger and Amadou Sow, but the Gauchos went cold in the final seven minutes of the game. Sophomore captain Devearl Ramsey has been the floor general for UCSB all season and averages over 31 minutes per contest but after Ramsey suffered an agonizing groin injury in the first half, chances looked bleak for the Gauchos who have fed off of Ramsey's leadership all year. ""úIt was hard without Devearl,""ù Pasternack said. ""úNot having our point guard, our leader, out there put a lot of onus on Max and JaQuori McLaughlin to bring the ball up the court and run the show and it took away their scoring aggressiveness at the end of the game.""ù Both teams came out swinging with strong starts in the ballgame ""î through the first 10 minutes, the two and three seeds were neck and neck. With 8:35 left in the first half and the score knotted up at 17 a piece, Ramsey drove the left side of the lane and with a sharp hesitation move, the point guard dropped to the floor in discomfort. ""ú[Devearl] has been the engine of our team and the leader of our team. He makes us go,""ù Pasternack said. ""úIt was the first game in 32 games that he wasn't our point guard""¶we were fairly injury-free this year. Unfortunately, it happened at the most important moment.""ù A non-contact injury that came at the worst possible time would be the catalyst in UCSB's end to a historic year. Nonetheless, the Gauchos powered on through the first half and headed into the break with a 28-25 lead over the Titans.  In the second, Heidegger and McLaughlin took over the scoring duties for UCSB, and the shorthanded win seemed possible as the Gauchos ballooned the lead up to 42-34 following back-to-back threes by Jarriesse Blackmon and McLaughlin which shifted momentum entirely in SB's favor.  Blackmon's triple came at the 13:39 mark, and it was his first three-point field goal since Dec. 22, 2016 when UCSB played Nevada. Ironically, when he hit that shot over two years prior, Devearl Ramsey had been playing with Nevada as a freshman and played in that game. The Gaucho lead reached a pinnacle after Heidegger drilled a fall-away jumper from the inside left-hash to give the ""òChos a 45-35 advantage, but Fullerton began to make its comeback. Slowly but surely, the Titans continued to clip at the lead, but UCSB held its own until there were six and a half minutes separating the Gauchos and the Big West Finals. If only it were that simple. Santa Barbara's 54-47 lead was snipped down in the final six minutes as the Gauchos went absolutely ice cold from the field and couldn't hold off the Titan comeback.  Fullerton rode a 14-4 run to close out the contest and ultimately took the lead with 1:12 left in the game after a Khalil Ahmad layup. UCSB shot an abysmal 0-10 on its final 10 field goal attempts, but without Devearl Ramsey on the floor, who could blame them? The Gauchos ached without their quarterback running the offense and although they made do for a little, there was no production at the end of the semifinal matchup. UCSB was unable to convert on a field goal over the last 7:07 of game-time and Fullerton caught fire. In two seasons as the Gauchos' head coach, Joe Pasternack has taken this team from what was the worst season in program history in 2016-17 to the best two-season stretch, an overall 45-19 record, that UCSB has ever seen.  ""úWe have a great culture,""ù added Pasternack. ""úAs good of a culture as I've ever been around, especially the guys that didn't play. That's really hard to find.  Furthermore, freshman Amadou Sow became the program's all-time freshman leader in points scored with 391 and field goals made with 150.  Sow was named to the All-Big West Second Team, and Ar'mond Davis notched an honorable mention from the Big West for his 13.1 points per game.  Jarriesse Blackmon was awarded Big West Conference Hustle Player of the year in his senior season.  The Gauchos will say goodbye to Davis, Blackmon, Ami Lakoju and Maxwell Kupchak from their current roster. The question looms: Would UCSB have made the finals if Ramsey doesn't get injured in the first half? One thing is for sure. Pasternack, Ramsey and the Gauchos will bounce back with a vengeance after this semifinal heartbreak.

sports,No. 17 UCSB Hopes To Sustain Successful Start Heading into Conference Play,29-Mar-19,2:44 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-03-29/no-17-ucsb-hopes-to-sustain-successful-start-heading-into-conference-play/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus Before the beginning of the 2019 campaign, the Big West Preseason Coaches Poll had the UCSB baseball team finishing fifth in the conference. Now, 21 games in, the Gauchos are sitting pretty in first place of the league standings heading into its first week of Big West play. A 17-4 overall record through 21 games, regardless of competition, should not be overlooked, especially considering the Gauchos amassed a below average 51-60-1 overall record the prior two seasons. Still, a fast start such as this one will mean nothing if Santa Barbara cannot sustain this success where it matters most,†conference play. And, first up on the league slate for UCSB is Big West powerhouse Cal State Fullerton who currently boasts just an 11-11 overall record to this point. Recent history would suggest that the Gauchos are poised for success this weekend. Last year, UCSB took two of three from the Titans, its first series win against CSUF since 2014. However, Santa Barbara has historically struggled against Fullerton. In the Andrew Checketts era, UCSB has gone just 9-12 with no series wins at Fullerton.†In fact, the last time the Gauchos bested the Titans was back in 2007 when they took two of three. Since then, UCSB has gone just 3-12 when playing at Goodwin Field,†home of the four-time national champion CSUF. All-time, UCSB is 44-109 against Cal State Fullerton. Nevertheless, this Gaucho team is as prepared as any to take a series from the Titans at their home field. UCSB comes into this game fresh off a loss against St. Mary's in which it blew a 6-0 lead. Before the loss, Santa Barbara had won 15 of its last 16 matchups including three-weekend sweeps. In fact, UCSB has yet to lose a weekend series this year registering a 7-0 record scoring an average run of 7.9 runs per game. A big factor in that is due to the Gauchos hitting power as a squad. This season,†UCSB has hit 25 round trippers to rank 23rd in the nation and nine different Gauchos have hit one through 21 games. Junior outfielders Tommy Jew and Armani Smith both lead the team in home runs each hitting six apiece. Jew and Smith also rank first (.695) and second (.633) in slugging percentage, respectively. Overall, Jew has also been consistently getting on base with a .412 percentage which ranks fourth among starters while his .329 batting average ranks third among the same bunch. Arguably the best hitter on the team is still junior catcher Eric Yang. The man behind the dish has been spectacular when stepping up to it currently slashing .408/.505/.566. Both his batting average and his on-base percentage rank first on the team while his slugging ranks fourth. To start the series, Ben Brecht will also be on the mound for the Gauchos. The southpaw has been great garnering a 4-0 record with a 3.06 ERA to start the year. In his last three starts, he has struck out 29 batters in 20 innings pitched while allowing just 12 hits and five earned runs. In total, Brecht's 50 strikeouts are the second most of any Big West pitcher. Brecht will have to be at the top of his game this series though as he is facing some serious athletes. CSUF boasts a strong pair of outfielders themselves as†Isaiah Garcia and†Mitchell Berryhill are the two best hitters on the team. Garcia leads the team in nearly every offensive category as he slashes .400/.477/.564. His 14 RBI's rank second and he is only one of four batters to hit a home run this season. Berryhill is just as solid as he ranks second in batting average (.395) and fourth in slugging percentage (.461). The senior is also dangerous out on the basepaths as his five stolen bases are the best mark on the team. UCSB will also have to be wary of CSUF's right-handed pitcher Tanner Bibee who will get the start on Friday. Bibee has a team-best ERA of 2.43 and has amassed a 3-3 overall record to this point. His 41 strikeouts are the third most by any pitcher in the league. This weekend is huge for Santa Barbara as it is a chance for them to show that it is for real. People could chalk up UCSB's record due to its competition but shutting down a powerhouse like Fullerton would certainly speak for itself. UCSB takes on Fullerton in a three-game series beginning at 7 p.m. on Friday, Mar. 29 at Goodwin Field. Game two will be at 6 p.m. on Saturday while game three will be at 1 p.m. on Sunday at the same location.

As expected, however, the Titans rallied back to make a game of it come the ninth inning, but junior right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln saved the day,†racking up his sixth save of the year and delivering the Gauchos a 7-6 win. ""úIt is never easy to steal even one game [at Goodwin] but to steal one on a Friday night is massive,""ù Lincoln said. ""úWe have been playing well and this win exemplifies that.""ù With the win, UCSB keeps its place atop the Big West standings improving to 18-4 overall and 1-0 in league. On the other side, Cal State Fullerton drops below .500 at 11-12 for the first time since being 5-6 back in early March. It is also 0-1 in conference play and continues†its plagues at home oddly enough dropping to 3-7 at Goodwin Field. UCSB was the first team on the scoreboard Friday night as two singles and a walk loaded the bases up with just one out in the top of the first. Junior outfielder Armani Smith brought in a run with a sac fly to left field. Trouble was brewing for UCSB and junior pitcher Ben Brecht in the bottom of the second. The southpaw walked the first batter then gave up two singles loading up the bases with no outs. Like a capable Friday starter, however, Brecht came alive striking out the next batter and forcing a couple of groundouts to keep the trouble to a minimum. Still, one run did get through for the Titans tying the game at 1-1. In the fourth, Santa Barbara countered as after a Smith triple and a walk by Andrew Martinez, freshman†Christian Kirtley came up big singling to right field. The Gauchos would add another run in the fifth courtesy of a Smith RBI groundout. Smith had another nice game for UCSB finishing 1-4 with two RBI's. The fourth-inning triple from the junior was his fourth of the year, a team-best mark, and his 21 RBI's this season are tied for the most on the team. The sixth inning is when the Gauchos really took control. With runners on second and third and one out, senior Tevin Mitchell brought in a run with sac fly. Then, junior catcher Eric Yang continued his tremendous season hitting a two-run home run to left field giving UCSB a 6-1 lead. Yang finished the night 3-5 finishing a triple shy of the cycle. His 21 RBI's are tied for a team-high and his great night at the plate resulting in his batting average being bumped to .420. ""úHe has been spectacular this year,""ù Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. ""úHe is hitting great, he is getting on base, he's catching, blocking balls, stealing bases, he is fantastic right now.""ù After Yang, junior Tommy Jew hit his seventh home run of the season to conclude a great inning for UCSB giving them a 7-1 lead. Fullerton countered in the bottom half of the sixth, however, scoring four runs of†its own. After an error by third baseman Jason Willow, CSUF worked three singles to score a run and load up the bases with no outs. Next, Brecht walked Titans' first baseman AJ Curtis resulting in a run for CSUF cutting the lead to 7-3. After giving up a sac fly, Brecht was retired and in came in freshman right-hander Michael McGreevy. Brecht finished the night allowing five hits and four earned runs while striking out seven to have 57 K's on the year, tied for the league best. McGreevy would give up one more run, which was credited to Brecht, and UCSB got out of the inning up 7-5. ""úThese all start to feel the same, we get this big lead and then our defensive concentration lapses a little bit. There's no clock, we have to get all those outs so we could do a better job of keeping defensive pressure when we get that lead,""ù Checketts said. Both teams traded scoreless frames until the bottom of the ninth. CSUF began the inning with a single from catcher Kameron†Guangorena. After advancing to second on a wild pitch, the freshman would come around to score thanks to an RBI single from senior outfielder Jarrius Richards bringing the Titans within one. With the tying run on and no outs, UCSB turned to junior ace closer Lincoln to get the job done. After a sac bunt, Lincoln got the next batter to ground out. Just one out away from a win and the tying run on third, Lincoln accidentally hit Mitchell Berryhill despite being up 1-2 in the count. After hitting Berryhill, Lincoln would face CSUF's best hitter Isaiah Garcia. The junior remained calm and forced the Titans batter to ground out giving UCSB the 7-6 win. ""úPersonally, this feels amazing. Beating Fullerton, no matter their record is a big confidence boost. I have had a couple of up and down outings but I really feel like I am hitting my stride,""ù Lincoln said. Friday's win for UCSB was big for multiple reasons. For one, it was the Gauchos first series-opening win at Cal State Fullerton since 2001. This also marks the third consecutive win against the Titans dating back to last years' series which saw the Gauchos take the final two. UCSB is now 8-1 on the year when reaching double-digit hits finishing with 11 on the night. Game two between UCSB & CSUF will begin at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Mar. 30 at Goodwin Field.

sports,Gauchos Look To Bolster Conf. Record Against No.22 CSUN,4-Apr-19,2:44 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/gauchos-look-to-bolster-conf-record-against-no-22-csun/,"Attacker Shannon Moran looks for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus No. 9 UCSB women's water polo team, 18-6 overall and 1-1 in conference play, will head to No. 22 Cal State Northridge this upcoming Saturday, where they will face the 13-15 Matadors.  Santa Barbara will look to get back in the win column, as it lost to No. 11 UC Davis in a heartbreaker, which snapped its win streak of five straight. Junior utility Sarah Snyder stuffed the stat sheet for the ""òChos with four goals, two steals and one assist. With just 3:48 left in the final period, UC Davis was able to score two goals before time expired, winning the game by a final score of 11-10. † Cal State Northridge has had an up-and-down year thus far and is currently on a three-game losing streak. The Matadors are led by junior utility Tori Wilson, who is coming off a hat trick in her most recent game, giving her a team-leading 57 goals on the year.  In its last matchup against No. 10 UC Irvine, CSUN was outscored by nine goals as it was unable to keep the Anteaters from finding the back of the net. Despite a strong effort from Wilson as well as junior utility Jennalyn Barthels, who netted two goals, the Matadors were unable to keep up with the high-powered offense of UC Irvine.  Even though CSUN has not had the year that they wanted, they are still a very dangerous team that is trying to develop the right habits in order to have a better season next year.  In order for the Gauchos to have success in this matchup, they will need to continue to have strong play from their two leaders on the offensive end, Snyder and freshman attacker Amanda Legaspi.  The duo has proved to be very effective for the Gauchos as they have consistently made an impact on the offensive side of the pool, whether by scoring goals or creating opportunities for their teammates. Snyder, in particular, is having another fantastic season, as she has netted 56 goals, 5 assists and 15 steals. She has also provided veteran leadership to an extremely †young team that consists of nine freshmen and only two seniors.  Senior utility Kate Pipkin has also been a huge part of why UCSB has been so successful this year, as she has 34 goals and 23 assists this season. Her strong play has prevented opposing teams from double-teaming Snyder, allowing them both to have success. Although some believed that it would take time for the team to develop the chemistry necessary to win games, the Gauchos have been able to find their rhythm behind strong teamwork and communication in the pool. This constant communication has led to an increase in steals and a decrease in fouls committed, which has kept the pressure off of their goalkeeper. One of the major reasons Santa Barbara has been able to win the majority of its games this season has been its dramatically improved defense from a year ago. In their last six matchups, the Gauchos have only given up an average of eight goals per game.  This can also be attributed to the strong play of junior goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, who leads the team with 132 saves on the year. It is clear that her confidence has grown since last year, which is showing in her improved results in front of the net. Santa Barbara will look to get back on track this Saturday at Cal State Northridge, where they will match up against the Matadors at 12 p.m. † Comments are closed.

sports,"Padres Promote Tatis Jr., Change Landscape of Baseball",4-Apr-19,2:38 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/padres-promote-tatis-jr-change-landscape-of-baseball/,"As a lifelong San Diegan, I've gone to my fair share of underwhelming opening days at Petco Park. In years past, the crowd had been relatively subdued, reserving their largest applause for washed-up veterans like Carlos Quentin or home-grown players like Chase Headley. In typical Padres fashion, we would lose a low-scoring affair and Padres fans would leave disappointed, knowing another losing season was on the way. On Thursday, for the first time in almost ten years, the energy in Petco Park was palpable as the Padres came out for introductions. Fans stood, screaming and cheering as $300 million-signing Manny Machado was introduced. In my entire life, I am convinced I have never heard Petco get that loud. Three players later, the crowd would top that for a rookie. As 20-year-old shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. walked out, the entire stadium shook with electricity. For the first time in a decade, Padres fans had hope. Tatis Jr. wasn't supposed to get a larger ovation than Machado ""î heck, he wasn't even supposed to make the opening day roster. Thanks to an antiquated rule in the collective bargaining agreement, keeping Tatis Jr. in the minor leagues to start the season would allow the Padres an extra year of control over the number one prospect in baseball. If Tatis becomes even half the player he is hyped to be, that year of control would prove to be an absolute bargain for the small-market Padres. Even larger market teams use this loophole to squeeze an extra year out of their top prospects, with the Cubs using this very rule with Kris Bryant in 2015. Despite being an outdated and unfair rule that will likely be changed in the next Collective Bargaining Agreement, it makes sense why owners and general managers want to use it. Until now, that is. In a city that craves so desperately a winner (or at least a competitive team) general manager A.J. Preller opted to change the entire dynamic of baseball by bringing up the heralded shortstop for opening day. This decision, along with the $300 million signing of Machado, show a willingness on the Padres' behalf to bring San Diego a world series title no matter the ramifications. In spring training, there was no doubt that Tatis Jr. belonged on the opening day roster ""î something he further proved on Thursday by going 2-3 despite facing Madison Bumgarner. But beyond his individual skill, the move by Preller signals to the rest of the Padres roster that he is serious about winning now, not in the future. If Tatis lives up to his hype, the Padres have already shown a willingness to lock him up for the long haul. With the number one farm system in MLB, Tatis is meant to be the nucleus of a young Padres core that should compete for years to come. Beyond just the Padres, Preller's decision will change the landscape of baseball for years to come. Fans and players alike will no longer be content with keeping star prospects in the minors just for that extra year of control. More importantly, the move will likely aid the players' case in abolishing the rule during the next CBA in 2021, as Preller's comments prove that players aren't held in the minors for ""údevelopment""ù but rather for that vital extra year of control. In a sport that often struggles to adapt to the times, Preller's decision is both shocking and necessary ""î something that Padres fans recognized when they gave Tatis Jr. a standing ovation on Thursday. An early favorite for rookie of the year, Tatis Jr. has helped energize a fanbase that has suffered through perpetual mediocrity. For the first time in recent memory, the Padres have some semblance of a major league caliber lineup. In 2021, the players union might be inclined to give that same standing ovation to A.J. Preller if the minor league rule is abolished. In the meantime, I'm going to sit back and enjoy the Padres compete for the first time in a decade.

Matchup,4-Apr-19,5:08 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-04/red-hot-no-19-ucsb-hosts-sfa-in-final-non-conf-matchup/,"Jack Dashwood pitches the ball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB baseball team's quest for its first Big West Title since 1986 will take a small break this week as the squad prepares to face Stephen F. Austin State University for its final non-conference series of the 2019 campaign. Santa Barbara is coming in red-hot as winners of three of its last four, including two of three wins at Fullerton in its conference opener, to boast a strong 20-5 overall record to this point. The Gauchos 2-1 conference record places them in second in the league standings, but they are the first team to reach 20 wins of any Big West team. Polar opposites of UCSB, Stephen F. Austin rolls into town one game under .500 sitting at 14-16 overall after losing six of its last seven ball games but is 8-4 in conference play. In those six losses, SFA lost by a combined score of 54-12. That does not bode well for the Lumberjacks considering they are playing one of hotter offenses in the Big West. UCSB ranks first in the league in multiple categories including runs scored (185), extra-base hits (70), home runs (29), slugging percentage (.493) and is tied for first in batting average (.287) and on-base percentage (.385). A big reason for UCSB's hot offense is junior catcher Eric Yang. The West Hills, Calif. native is currently having the season of a lifetime holding a league best .419 batting average. No other player in the Big West even has above a .400. Yang is also delivering when it counts as he is second in the Big West with 28 RBI's. The juniors .513 on-base percentage is also tops in the league while his .591 slugging percentage ranks sixth. On Monday, the Big West announced that Yang was awarded Player of the Week. Yang hit .500 (7-for-14) in the three-game series against Cal State Fullerton, adding a home run to go along with six RBIs and four runs scored. He also went 1-4 in last Tuesday's game against St. Mary's with his one hit being a double. There have only been four games where the catcher has not registered a hit and he has had a multiple-hit game fourteen times this season. Other hot hitters include outfielders Tevin Mitchell, Tommy Jew and Armani Smith. Mitchell has been on fire as of late batting 10-24 in his last six games smacking six doubles. Before this recent stretch, he only had one double on the year. He has also knocked in seven of his 22 RBI's and his 13 stolen bases tops the league. Jew has probably been the biggest bat in the lineup for the Gauchos. He currently slashes .303/.385/.667 with his slugging percentage ranking second in the Big West. The junior center fielder also has the second most dingers in the Big West with eight on the year. Right behind Jew, however, is Smith who has seven home runs on then season which ranks third in the league. Smith has been an extra-base hit machine having five doubles and a team high five triples. His 24 RBI's are the second most on the team. Just seeing how tough most of the Gaucho lineup is scary for the Lumberjacks who currently holds a team ERA of 5.21. That ERA ranks in the bottom half of the entire NCAA. In terms of starters, Alex Palmer has started all seven of his appearances and holds a 3.20 ERA. Batting wise, freshman ourfielder Brandon Uhse has carried the bulk of the offense. He leads the team in batting average with a .310%. Uhse also has the most multiple hit game with 11. Overall, this should be a good weekend for UCSB. Facing a weaker pitching staff than it did last week should be a nice change of pace before heading back into conference play. UCSB faces SFA for game one of the three-game set at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 5 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 17, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus UCSB will look to get back on track after being swept in their conference opener against Cal State Fullerton. The Gauchos are currently on an extended losing streak of 12 games, while on the other side the Aggies had won eight in a row before losing to Cal State Northridge on Sunday. The season has been a struggle so far for UCSB after beginning the year on a high note. They won three of their first four games, but the season has gone downhill since then. Their 0-3 conference record, along with their 6-28 overall record, puts them last in the Big West at this point in time.  Even though the season has been a struggle so far for the Gauchos, things seem to be looking up for them. They performed impressively against a very good Cal State Fullerton team ""î the score was tight in every game of the last series, even forcing extra innings in the second of their three game set. There is still a lot of time left in this season and much room for the Gauchos to improve. This year, UCSB has been led by sophomore outfielder Sammy Fabian, whose .444 batting average places her at second in the entire Big West Conference. She also slugs .485 and has proven to be a tough contender at the plate, with only six strikeouts out of 99 at-bats this season so far. She has a record of six stolen bases, ranking her top five in the conference. The Gauchos pitching staff is led by junior Felisha Noriega, who boasts a 5-12 record in her 22 appearances. In 87.1 innings pitched, Noriega has posted a stellar 3.37 ERA with six complete games and K/BB ratio of 55/46. Noriega will be the key to UCSB's success as the longer she is able to go, the better chance they have of sticking around and ""î possibly ""î upsetting UC Davis. The rotation is rounded out by Veronika Gulvin, who has an ERA of 4.81, and Emily Schuttish, who has an ERA of 5.74. On the other side, UC Davis's successful season has been due to an elite pitching staff and a top-heavy lineup full of great hitters. Leading the way at the dish for the Aggies is Senior Meghan Bradbury, who is batting .312 and a major power hitter. She is fourth in the Big West and first on her team with 29 RBI's, along with seven dingers.  But Bradbury is not the only slugger in the lineup for the Aggies. Their team includes four starters recorded as batting above .300 and six starters hitting over .275. This combination provides a tough challenge that can wear down any opposing pitcher. Davis is able to rely on their hitters to win games, but their elite pitching staff is arguably the biggest reason they've earned one of the best records in college softball. Sophomore Brooke Yanez has been one of the best pitchers in the country this season as her 1.08 ERA and 164 strikeouts are each good enough to lead the Big West in each respective category, while also placing top ten in the entire country. Yanez is backed up by senior Sara Cadona, who is second in the conference with a 1.91 ERA, and by junior Katie Kibby, whose 2.69 ERA is good for seventh in the conference. Davis's deeply talented pitching staff has been the key to their success this season, and UCSB will have to really fight in order to win against one of the Big West's elite teams. The series will kick off with a doubleheader on Saturday, April 6. It begins at 1 p.m. at Campus Diamond. A version of this article appeared on p. 8 of the April 4, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Set To Take on Streaking Rainbow Wahine,11-Apr-19,5:30 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/gauchos-set-to-take-on-streaking-rainbow-wahine/,"Sierra Altmeyer makes contact with the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus After taking one of three matches against UC Davis last weekend at home, the UCSB softball team will travel to Hawai'i to play three of six straight road conference games. With their Saturday win over UC Davis, the Gauchos grabbed their first conference win of the season, improving their record to 1-5 in the Big West and 7-30 overall. On the other side, the Rainbow Wahine have won four games in a row, including a series sweep on the road against Cal Poly. Hawai'i is 5-1 in the Big West and 24-10 overall, good enough to tie Cal State Fullerton for first place in the conference. In order for UCSB to find success in this series they will have to limit the powerful offensive attack of the Rainbow Wahine with strong outings from each of their starters. Hawai'i's lineup is littered with power hitters which makes them extra dangerous and taxing on the arm of any starting pitcher. Lead by Callee Heen and Nicole Lopez, Hawai'i leads the Big West in runs per game at 5.29, as well as in home runs with 35. Heen and Lopez have 11 and 10 dingers respectively, but their lineup consists of four players who bat above .300 and nine players who have at least one home run. One more stat to consider when looking ahead to this series is that the 180 runs scored by Hawai'i this season more than double the 88 scored by Santa Barbara, which again conveys that in order for the Gauchos to keep pace, they will have to limit the offensive output of the Rainbow Wahine. In the Gauchos' lone win against UC Davis they were lead by Veronika Gulvin who only allowed four hits and one run in a complete game to earn her first win of the season. This will likely be the formula for success for UCSB as their offense has struggled recently by failing to put up more than three runs in 10 consecutive games. Santa Barbara would benefit if one or more hitters had a breakout series as no one in their lineup has been able to find a groove so far in conference play. Sammy Fabian, UCSB's leading hitter throughout this season, still sports a .427 overall batting average this season, but her numbers have dipped to just .263 in conference play, and if she can right the ship the team will be in a much better position to win games. The Gauchos have only managed to score four total runs in their six conference games with only two extra base hits in that span, and they will need all the run support they can get to keep up with a potent offensive team like Hawai'i. Hawai'i has two pitchers who have thrown 182.2 of 223 total innings for the Rainbow Wahine, the first being Brittany Hitchcock, who ranks in the top five of the Big West in ERA, wins and strikeouts. She is one of two starters for UH with the other being Izzy Dino, who has thrown 77.2 innings and ranks seventh in ERA at 2.57. On the other side, Santa Barbara's pitching staff has found increased success in conference play with a solid 3.09 ERA in six games. Felisha Noriega and Veronika Gulvin pitch the majority of the innings for the Gauchos and while they do not have top 10 ERA's like Hawai'i's pitchers, they are both capable of putting together a solid outing and putting their team in a position to win. This series will most likely be decided by whichever club's pitching staff can stay composed and allow their offense to back them up. The three-game series will begin Friday, April 12 at 9 p.m. PST in Honolulu. A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the April 11, 2019 edition of the Daily Nexus. Comments are closed.

With a 24-5 overall mark to this point and the No. 6 highest rating percentage index (RPI, a quantity used to rank sports teams based upon a team's wins and losses and its strength of schedule) in the country, Santa Barbara has set itself up for its best season since its College World Series run in 2016. It also helps that UCSB proved itself a little bit in its opening Big West series, taking two of three at Fullerton to be second in the conference standings with a 2-1 mark. However, there are still people that doubt the Gauchos and roll with the team that is cruising into town this weekend, UC Irvine. And it makes sense because if UCSB is the most dominant team to this point, UCI is not far behind. Nexus File Photo The Anteaters currently boast a 21-6 overall record and have had a great 5-1 start to conference play after taking two of three at Hawai""òi and sweeping through Long Beach State. In fact, after starting the year 8-4, Irvine has won 13 of its last 15 ball games with its last loss coming to No. 1 UCLA, 9-3. UC Irvine also has one of the most impressive players in the conference, junior third baseman Brandon Lewis. Lewis is leading the Anteaters and Big West in many major offensive categories with his 11 home runs, 37 RBIs, 13 doubles and a slugging percentage of .773. That slugging percentage is also 11th in the entire NCAA. Just recently, the Porter Ranch, Calif. native was named to the USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award Midseason Watch List, a prestigious award given to the top amateur baseball player in the country. Lewis is the lone Big West member on the 40-player list. One of his teammates that was considered, however, was junior right-handed pitcher Andre Pallante. The San Clemente, Calif. native is having an outstanding year currently sporting a 2.83 ERA with 44 punchouts. Pallante is slated as the starter for Friday's game as he has been all year, but it would be fair to say he has not faced a lineup quite like UCSB's. The Gauchos have some of the top hitters in the league with junior catcher Eric Yang being only one of two players to have above a .400 batting average and players like Armani Smith and Tommy Jew, each having eight home runs apiece, tied for second most in the conference. Santa Barbara also ranks first in the following categories of the conference: slugging percentage (.492), on-base percentage (.385), home runs (34) and RBI's (197). UCSB is also fast on the base paths as Tevin Mitchell and Jew are first and second in the Big West with 15 and 14 stolen bases this season, respectively. Santa Barbara also has some tough cats on the mound. Friday starter Ben Brecht has been great this season with a 3.00 ERA and 61 strikeouts, the second most in the conference. Even better, Brecht has accumulated a 6-0 record in his eight starts, proving he has done a good job of giving his relievers some room to breathe. Brecht averages about six innings per start, but in his last start, the southpaw tossed 7.1 innings. Sophomore Jack Dashwood has also been a good weekend start for the Gauchos as he sports a 2.27 ERA in 39.2 innings of work. That ERA ranks in the top five of the conference. Junior righty Chris Lincoln is the first man out of the pen for the Gauchos in usual tough spots and he has been good this season. Despite his 4.29 ERA not being the most impressive, Lincoln has usually delivered for UCSB as proven by his seven saves this season. Overall, this series will be a great one. By no means does it determine a conference winner, but conference victories are always a hot commodity. And with the race for the Big West just starting out, no team can afford to lose ground. UCSB will host UC Irvine for game one of the three-game series at 3 p.m. on Friday, April 12 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Game two will commence at 2 p.m. on Saturday while game three will start at 1 p.m. on Sunday at the same location.

sports,No. 3 UCSB To Close Out Regular Season with Pair of Matches Against No. 9 UC Irvine,11-Apr-19,5:09 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-3-ucsb-to-close-out-regular-season-with-pair-of-matches-against-no-9-uc-irvine/," Only a week away from the start of the men's volleyball postseason, UCSB looks to wrap up the regular season with a pair of wins over No. 9 UC Irvine. This week of play will be a true test of the Gauchos' ability to solidify themselves as not only a top three program in the nation, but also within their own highly-competitive Big West Conference that consists of schools that all break the NCAA Top 15, excluding UC San Diego. Currently seeded as the third place team with an even split conference record of 4-4, the only teams that currently stand higher than UCSB are No. 1 Hawai""òi and No. 2 Long Beach State, both of whom are undefeated in regular season and conference play. UC Irvine follows closely as well, coming in at the fourth seed with a 3-5 conference record. On the season, the Gauchos boast a 17-7 overall record, just above a win percentage of .700. Considering the first of this week's pair of matches will be away at UC Irvine, a win for the Gauchos will have UCSB's away record all level at 5-5 on the season. Meanwhile, the Gauchos have turned the Robertson Gymnasium into a bit of a fortress, with UCSB's home record currently standing at 11-2 on the season. The Gauchos will look to return to their winning ways, as they'll be coming off a most recent pair of losses to No. 1 Hawai'i, away at the big island. In their two games, UCSB only managed to snag a single set in their favor, but it was enough to snap the Rainbow Warriors' win streak of 74 sets in a row. As for UC Irvine, the Anteaters find themselves at a 15-10 overall for the season, meaning they have a win percentage of .600. Plenty will be at stake for both sides here, as the Anteaters are only a win behind in the conference standings, so an unfavorable reseeding is possible if the Gauchos accidentally falter. Historically, UCSB is favored considering the all-time series between the two sides. With a 46-30 head-to-head record, the Gauchos will want to further add to it. However, UCSB split last year's pair of matches between them and UC Irvine, with the Anteaters besting them in their last matchup with a 3-0 clean sweep before the beginning of the postseason. Players to watch for the Gauchos include senior outside hitter Corey Chavers and freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox. Chavers leads his side in scoring with a total of 313 kills on the season. Wilcox, who continues his impressive rookie campaign, follows next with 214 kills to his name. With both players in the Big West top 10 for scoring, this Chavers and Wilcox combo is definitely a force to be reckoned with. In UC Irvine's corner, the Anteaters have a trio of attackers in senior opposite Karl Apfelbach, senior outside hitter Aaron Koubi and sophomore outside hitter Joel Schneidmiller, who are all capable of doing some damage. However, the scoring leader of the bunch, Schneidmiller, has yet to play a set since his last match against BYU back in March. With his status still in question, UCSB should game plan against the next immediate danger from Apfelbach and Koubi. All the action begins first on the road as UCSB visits UC Irvine this Friday, April 12 at 7 p.m. Then the Gauchos will return home for their second bout against the Anteaters on the following day, Saturday, April 13 at 7 p.m. in the Robertson Gymnasium.

sports,No.11 UCSB WaPo Looks To Upset No.4 Hawai'i,11-Apr-19,5:17 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-11/no-11-ucsb-wapo-looks-to-upset-no-4-hawaii/,"Nexus File Photo No. 11 UCSB women's water polo team, 19-6 overall and 2-1 in conference play, will head to No. 4 Hawai""òi this upcoming Saturday where they will face the 15-5 Rainbow Wahine. Santa Barbara will look to pick up their second win in a row, following their 19-8 rout against No. 22 Cal State Northridge. Junior utility Sarah Snyder had four goals in the matchup while senior attacker Sarah Kreiser and freshman utility Caitlyn Snyder had hat tricks of their own. While the offense was stellar against the Matadors, the defense also deserves high praise as both goalkeepers, sophomore goalkeeper Becca Buck and junior goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder, combined for 11 saves in the game. Hawaii is having a tremendous year and has won six of their last nine matchups. The Rainbow Wahine are led by senior attacker Irene Gonzalez who has 50 goals and 24 assists on the season thus far. Since Gonzalez is a willing passer, she has been a nightmare for her opponents because they are unable to double team her. Defensively, the Rainbow Wahine are led by freshman goalkeeper Bridget Layburn, who has 86 saves on the year along with an overall record of 10-3 in the games she has played in. In order for Santa Barbara to pull off the upset, they will need to continue to play stout defense against a high powered Hawaii offense. This means that UCSB's goalkeepers must continue to rack up saves while also maintaining strong communication with their back line. Both Buck and Snyder have split time in front of the cage and will likely do the same in this upcoming matchup.
""úWe are lucky that we have two strong keepers,""ù Head Coach Serela Kay said. ""úThey both push each other and really respect each other. I'm very excited about both of them.""ù Moreover, Snyder must continue to be the leader on the offensive end of the pool. She now has 60 goals on the year ""î a team high ""î along with six assists. Dating back to last season, she has always been a proficient scorer for the 'Chos, but this season she has really developed as a leader as well. ""úShe is very special and has really taken her game to another level,""ù Kay explained. ""úIn anything she does, she excels. You can talk about people being good and great but she is in the elite category.""ù Freshman utility Caitlyn Snyder, who is the sister of Sarah Snyder, has been a great surprise for UCSB as she has made an impact on both sides of the pool. With her 25 goals this year, she ranks fourth on the team which has provided stability for Santa Barbara offensively. With so many offensive threats, it makes the squad extremely difficult to defend, especially during power plays.
""úCaitlyn's upside is through the roof,""ù Kay stated. ""úShe creates on the counter, can score from the perimeter, as well as can fill the center role. Her versatility is extremely valuable and she has a very bright future ahead of her.""ù One of the reasons why Santa Barbara has been so successful as of late is because the team is playing with extreme confidence. It is clear that there is an immense amount of trust on the team which has led to their positive results. Despite being an extremely young group, the 'Chos have been able to develop the chemistry necessary to win against difficult opponents. UCSB is back in action this Saturday, April 13 at 9 p.m. in Hawaii as they look to pick up their 20th win of the season.

sports,"Rowan Blasts 2 Home Runs, Helps No. 14 UCSB Defeat No. 16 UC Irvine",12-Apr-19,7:41 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-12/rowan-blasts-2-home-runs-no-14-ucsb-defeats-no-16-uc-irvine-in-game-one/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus Senior designated hitter/utility Thomas Rowan belted two no-doubt round-trippers on Friday, one in the third and one in the eighth inning, to help lift the No. 14 ranked UCSB baseball team past No. 16 UC Irvine, 4-1. The win gives Santa Barbara its seventh consecutive and pushes them to 25-5 overall on the year, 3-1 in Big West play. The victory also snapped Irvine's five-game conference win streak dropping them to 5-2 in the Big West and 21-7 overall. On the mound, the Gauchos were solid all evening surrendering just four hits to the Anteaters, a team that came in averaging eight hits per game. Junior left-handed pitcher Ben Brecht (7-0), in particular, turned in another great performance on the bump tossing a season-high 7.2 innings, striking out eight batters, en route to his seventh win of the year. Still, the game did not start out so strong for the southpaw. Brecht would walk the opening batter of the game then hit the next one giving Irvine runners on first and second. Junior infielder Brandon Lewis, a member of the USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award Midseason Watch List, brought home a run for the ""òEaters lacing a ball through left field. With runners on the corners and no outs, Brecht responded by getting the next Irvine batter, Adrian Damla, to hit into a double play, then struck out Mike Peadbody to end the first allowing just one run despite the shaky start. With two outs in the first, junior center fielder Tommy Jew kept the bottom half of the first frame alive by rocketing a ball to right field to leg out his fifth triple of the year. He would come around to score following an RBI single from Rowan tying the match at 1-1. After that Lewis RBI single, Brecht really settled in retiring the next 11 batters not allowing another hit until the fifth inning. By then, UCSB held a 2-1 advantage thanks to a home run to left center from Rowan in the third inning, the only hit of that inning. Even with allowing a hit in the fifth plus a walk, Brecht kept working his way out of every jam. In the top of the eighth, up 2-1, with two outs, UCSB's defense faltered. It faltered in a way very reminiscent to the Gauchos losses at St. Mary's and Cal State Fullerton. First, sophomore third baseman Jason Willow could not field a ball hit down the line to him, then junior short stop McClain O'Connor misplayed a ball. This set up Irvine with the tying run on second and the go-ahead on first. Following the two errors, Brecht would be relieved by freshman Michael McGreevy. Brecht finished the day allowing just three hits and walked two batters. His eight strikeouts give him 69 on the year, pushing him back in front of having the league's most K's. McGreevy inherited the two runners, and did not let them go anywhere forcing a ground out, ending the top half of the frame. Up 2-1, UCSB needed a few more insurance runs just to keep themselves in a favorable position heading into the ninth. The Gauchos got those runs thanks to a solo home run from Rowan to kick off the inning. After the round tripper, junior outfielder Armani Smith ripped a ball to left center to leg out his team-high sixth triple of the year. A double from Andrew Martinez would bring home Smith and give UCSB a 4-1 lead. In the ninth, McGreevy gave up one hit, but nothing else en route to his fifth save of the year and securing Santa Barbara's game one, 4-1 win. All-in-all, UCSB played a good game, delivering nine hits on the day and handing junior Andre Pallante his third loss of the year. Today's win also marks another positive for UCSB: it continues to highlight that this team is for real. Though a better way to do that would be to seal up a series victory. Santa Barbara will face UC Irvine in game two of the series beginning at 2 p.m. on Saturday, April 13 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

sports,Red-Hot Hawai'i Sweeps Last Place UCSB,15-Apr-19,7:45 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-15/red-hot-hawaii-sweeps-last-place-ucsb/,"Melanie Menor catches the ball before the LBSU hitter gets a chance to get to second base. Nicole Wallace/Daily Nexus The UCSB softball team suffered a sweep at the hands of the first-place Hawai'i Rainbow Wahine last weekend, dropping their record to 1-8 in the Big West and 7-33 overall for the season.  The Gauchos hit the road for the first time in Big West play when they played Hawai'i in Honolulu for a three-game set that included one game on Friday and a doubleheader on Saturday.  Hawai'i was riding a four-game winning streak heading into the series and Santa Barbara had recently snapped their 13-game losing streak with a win against UC Davis, so both teams had experienced some recent success that they would try to build on during this weekend's matchup. Friday's game was a tight one that the Gauchos lead for a significant portion thanks to a third inning single from Sammy Fabian that scored Kayla Krantz and gave UCSB a 1-0 lead. Fabian was 1-3 on the day and one of six Gauchos that recorded a base hit. UCSB carried their 1-0 lead into the fifth inning, where they managed to get runners on second and third with no outs but failed to score and extend their lead. The potent Hawai'i offense was then able to make the Gauchos pay for failing to take advantage of the opportunity by putting up four runs in the bottom half of the inning. The bulk of the damage was done by the Big West's homerun leader Callee Heen, whose twelfth big fly of the season put the Rainbow Wahine up 4-1. This proved to be too big a hole for the Gauchos to climb out of.  Both games in the next day's doubleheader followed similar patterns of Hawai'i grabbing an early lead and never relinquishing it, as the Rainbow Wahine took both Saturday games by scores of 3-1 and 5-2.  The first game of the day saw Hawai'i take a 3-0 lead through the third inning before allowing their pitching staff to do the heavy lifting down the stretch by only allowing one run from UCSB's hitters. The one run scored by the Gauchos came on a sixth inning single by Devan Sperry that scored Maci Fines, who had two hits in the game. As the Gauchos loaded the bases in the top of the seventh, Santa Barbara did make Hawai'i sweat it out down the stretch ""î only for Sammy Fabian to fly out with the game-tying run in scoring position. In the third game of the series and the second game of the day, the Rainbow Wahine carried over their momentum from their earlier win as they scored four runs in the first inning off of three singles and a bases-loaded walk. Hawai'i would hold their lead for the rest of the game behind a strong outing from pitcher Izzy Dino who only allowed four hits and two runs en route to a complete game, improving her individual record to 9-5. The two runs for the Gauchos both came in the seventh inning after things had more or less been decided, with an RBI single from Rayna Cohen who later scored on a fielding error by Hawai'i. Sammy Fabian led Santa Barbara on offense as she had two of the Gauchos four hits on the game. At 1-8, the Gauchos find themselves sitting in last place in the Big West Conference at this point in the season and with an upcoming series against 4-5 Long Beach State, they will look to improve that record against another squad that has yet to find its way so far in conference play.  The Gauchos will play their next game on Friday, April 19 in Long Beach as part of a doubleheader before playing in the series finale on the following Saturday.

sports,Gauchos Drop to Fourth Seed in Big West After Falling to UC Irvine,16-Apr-19,6:10 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-16/gauchos-drop-to-fourth-seed-in-big-west-after-falling-to-uc-irvine/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus It's been a week of volleyball that the Gauchos would like to forget and to forget quickly, as there are bigger fish to fry with the Big West Volleyball Championship up next. All the action started last Friday night when UCSB visited UCI for the first of two encounters. The first set of the night started off fairly close, and it seemed momentum kept jumping back and forth between possessions. A quarter of the way through, a kill by UCI's Aaron Koubi brought his side the first significant lead of the match, with a 9-5 score favoring the Anteaters. Following this point, the Gauchos seemed to flip the script and fought back. Eventually, off a kill by Gaucho outside hitter Ryan Wilcox, UCSB tied the point tally at 15-apiece. For the remainder of the set, it was truly neck and neck, with no side gaining a lead greater than three points. Although it seemed likely that the Gauchos would take this set late, the hosts prevailed by a final score of 29-27. Dropping that last set must have been quite demoralizing for the Gauchos, because the following set proved to be the team's worst of the whole series versus Irvine. With the Gauchos not being able to find their defensive bearings in this one, the set would favor the home side once more, resulting in a 25-12 final score.  The third and final set of the night saw a bit more energy from the Gauchos, as the good guys kept it close and competitive once more. However, the Anteaters were stingy with their lead in this one and managed a hard-fought 25-22 victory, and the first night went to UCI with a final set score of 3-0. On Saturday night, it was UCI's turn to travel, as UCSB hosted its last regular season match. The Gauchos were likely seeking redemption but couldn't find it in the first set. Although closely matched in the beginning, it was around when the point tally reached 13-8, off a kill by UCI's Karl Apfelbach, that the visitors began to run away with this one. Although a service ace from Gaucho outside hitter Corey Chavers brought the tally back within five at 21-16, the Anteaters went on to secure the first set of night two with a final score of 25-17 [[ok]]. The major bright spot of the series for the Gauchos came in this second set as UCSB fought hard to earn and maintain its lead. The Anteaters didn't make this an easy task; however, UCSB's fight paid off as the home side was victorious by a 25-22 tally. In the third set, it appeared the Gauchos were in a good position to snag back-to-back sets. Still, the hosts were in catch-up mode for the majority of it. A service error on UCI's behalf did, however, bring it back within one at 19-18. Nevertheless, the Gauchos couldn't muster up a comeback in time and dropped the third set by a 25-21 result. The fourth and final set arguably wrapped the series up on a high note, as a total of 66 points were tallied by its end. It was truly the epitome of back and forth, neck and neck, in this one, with the lead never surpassing more than two points. Ultimately, the Anteaters took this one, too, by a final score of 34-32 ""î meaning the final set score also went to the visitors, at 3-1. † This regular season finale was also the senior night for Corey Chavers, Connor Drake and Hayden Boehle, who were all recognized in their last home game at Robertson Gymnasium. Up next for the Gauchos is the Big West Volleyball Championship. Although these past two defeats dropped UCSB down a spot in the seeding, the Gauchos will be facing a CSUN side whom they've bested twice by set scores of 3-0 and 3-2, back in late March. UCSB will face CSUN in Hawai'i this Thursday, April 18, at 7:30 p.m. †††

sports,"No. 11 UCSB Can't Overcome Offensive Woes, Fall to No. 5 Hawai'i",17-Apr-19,12:34 AM,['Nithesh Perumal'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-17/no-11-ucsb-cant-overcome-offensive-woes-fall-to-no-5-hawaii/,"Sarah Kreiser searches for a teammate to pass to. Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus The No. 11 ranked UCSB women's water polo team, who are currently 19-7 overall, suffered a tough loss Saturday on the road to No. 5 Hawai'i, who are now 15-9 overall. † Coming off a dominating 19-8 performance against Cal State Northridge last week, the ""òChos looked to carry their momentum and pull off the upset in their last regular season matchup away from home.  Unfortunately for UCSB, their red-hot offense was unable to break through against the Rainbow Wahine defense, as they were able to stifle the Gauchos for four straight quarters.  Santa Barbara got off to a slow start, as the squad was unable to score until junior utility Sarah Snyder connected with senior attacker Sarah Kreiser for a goal with 5:31 left in the quarter. Despite the strong chemistry this team has shown thus far, they were outscored by three goals in the first period.  Hawai'i took a commanding 8-1 lead during the second period, fueled by Hawai'i's goalkeeper Molly DiLalla who posted an impressive 85.7% save percentage. DiLalla has had a huge impact for the Rainbow Wahine, making it extremely difficult for opposing teams to find the back of the net. 
 Coming out of the half, the Gauchos started to gain their rhythm as they outscored Hawai'i 4-3 in the third period. Senior utility Kate Pipkin rallied the team behind a huge conversion on a penalty, jumpstarting the stagnant Gaucho offense. As one of the few seniors on the team, Pipkin has been instrumental with regards to her consistent leadership. This has allowed the Gauchos to stay resilient despite being behind by a couple of scores. Even though UCSB came into the fourth period down 11-5, Santa Barbara put up a good fight, starting with Snyder as she notched her third hat trick in a row with two well-timed goals in the final period of play. The Gauchos could have cut into the lead further, but freshman attacker Amanda Legaspi was unable to convert on a late penalty. Although she was unable to convert, she will surely learn from these experiences, as the Big West Tournament comes closer. Despite this resurgence, the big lead Hawai'i had built in the first half proved insurmountable, leading to a 15-9 Gaucho defeat.  With this loss the Gauchos are 2-2 in conference play but will look to learn from their mistakes as they head toward the Big West Tourney. Although losing to the top seed in the Big West does not bode well, there are positives that can come from this loss.  The ""òChos found a way to get past the stifling defense of the Rainbow Wahine in the second half, which should give them confidence that they have figured out how to establish an offensive rhythm despite being matched up against tougher opponents. With players like Legaspi getting key minutes late in games despite being a freshman, it also shows that this team has much more depth than originally expected. With many young players playing big minutes for the team, the future of the squad is very bright.  The UCSB women's water polo team will have their senior day in their final game this upcoming Saturday, April 20, against Long Beach State at home to wrap up the regular season.

sports,No. 4 UCSB To Face CSUN In Big West Quarterfinals,18-Apr-19,4:27 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/no-4-ucsb-to-face-csun-in-big-west-quarterfinals/,"With the regular season all wrapped up, the postseason for men's volleyball is now upon us. Tournament seeding also gives us an early look at who plays who, and when they do, as No. 4 UCSB look to put up a good showing in this year's Big West Men's Volleyball Championship. The first opponent that'll be standing in the way of the UCSB's postseason glory is a familiar one in CSUN. This meeting will have shades of 2018's Quarterfinals considering the Matadors had eliminated the Gauchos from the postseason almost a year ago. UCSB will want to flip the narrative back in their favor and put up an imposing performance that's representative of their status as a top four program in the nation. Although the Gauchos will be coming off a recent slump in form, following a four-game losing streak against No. 1 Hawai'i and No. 5 UCI, hopes are high to finish out yet another strong season's campaign. UCSB currently stands at an overall record of 17-9 on the season; a winning percentage of .654. Playing in arguably the most competitive league, the Gauchos' conference record comes in at 4-5. As for CSUN, the Matadors have won 3 of their last 4 matches to close out the regular season; including a 3-2 home win over No. 5 UCI. On the season, CSUN holds a flat .500 win percentage at an overall record of 13-13. The Matadors' 3-7 conference record places them fifth in the league table, only one seeding spot behind Santa Barbara. Historically speaking, the Gauchos hold a slight advantage against the Matadors, with an all-time series record of 53-40. UCSB was also victorious in their most recent bout, back in late March, where they bested CSUN first at home by means of a 3-0 clean sweep, then on the road in a much closer 3-2 affair. Ones to watch on the opposing end includes CSUN's senior outside hitter Dimitar Kalchev and redshirt freshman setter Taylor Ittner. Kalchev leads his side in total kills this far through the season, with a total of 333; that's 100 kills more than the next top scorer for the Matadors. As for Ittner, he's in control of it all when it comes to distribution. Ittner's 947 assists is a staggering amount, but it helps when you have hungry scorers like Kalchev backing you. For the Gauchos, players to watch include junior opposite Keenan Sanders, junior setter Casey McGarry, and junior setter Randy DeWeese. Through the 95 sets he's played, Sanders has tallied a total of 156 kills; that's a kill per set ratio of 1.64. Although only the third highest scorer for the Gauchos', Sanders' expertise with starting last year's quarterfinal matchup against CSUN will prove very valuable. As for the junior setters situation, Gaucho head coach Rick McLaughlin will have to figure something of a rotation, or not, considering both players' form. With more sets under DeWeese's belt, only 6 assists separate him from McGarry. However, just like Sanders, McGarry is familiar with this opponent and scenario. Regardless, both setters are wildly talented and have played crucial parts in getting UCSB here. This match is looking to be a close and competitive one, worthy of closing out the first night of the Big West Men's Volleyball Championship. The winner of this one is slated to take on first seed Long Beach State the day after. The UCSB versus CSUN quarterfinal is all set and only days away; scheduled for this Thursday, April 18th, at 10:30 PM in Honolulu, Hawai'i. Long Beach allllll the way.

sports,No. 7 UCSB Puts 9-Game Winning Streak on the Line Versus UC Davis,18-Apr-19,3:24 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/87584/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus Fresh off a series sweep of then No. 16 UC Irvine this past weekend, the No. 7 UCSB baseball team is riding its biggest high of the season. Not only are the Gauchos a league-best 5-1, but they also possess a 27-5 overall record, the best winning percentage in the nation (.844),† and are currently on a nine-game winning streak ""î that's only their second best run this season. UCSB will hope to continue this hot streak it has going when it welcomes UC Davis into town this weekend. The Aggies are currently 11-18 overall and are tied for seventh in the Big West with a 3-6 conference mark. All season long, Santa Barbara has produced efficient play, both at the plate and on the field. Last weekend's sweep of UCI, however, proved that this UCSB team is not a fluke, they are for real. In that series, the Gauchos pitching staff held the Anteaters to just an average of five hits and one run per game. Coming into that series, Irvine had averaged eight hits per game and nearly seven runs. Additionally, UCSB totaled 28 hits and 17 runs during the series. Irvine had given up an average of seven hits and just 3.5 runs per game before the three-game set. Point is, UCSB proved a lot last weekend, and, despite UC Davis posing less of a threat, there is no doubt this team is still gearing to prove everybody wrong. Sitting at first place in the Big West, the Gauchos are currently in prime position to claim its first Big West title since 1986. A big reason for that is the renewed offensive output, specifically, power hitting. The Gauchos have already surpassed their home run total of 2018 (34), with 38 thus far with 22 games still remaining. This season, UCSB is 22-1 when hitting at least one home run in a game. It is 5-4 when it fails to do so. Even beyond the long ball, Santa Barbara leads the entire country in triples with 21. Outfielders Armani Smith and Tommy Jew keep jockeying for the team lead in triples with the former having six and latter having five. Smith is ranks second in the country while Jew ranks ninth. Funny enough, Smith and Jew are also tied for the most home runs on the team with each having eight a piece. Junior catcher Eric Yang is also continuing his great season. Yang leads UCSB with a .393 batting average which also ranks 43 in the country. His 34 RBI's are also a team high. The catcher has also been a beast behind the plate, boasting a .996 fielding percentage and he has thrown out 50% of base runners attempting to steal. UCSB's pitching staff has also been nothing short of great. The staff currently ranks eighth in WHIP (1.13) and 13th in ERA (3.20) in the country. Friday starter Ben Brecht has been awesome this season. Brecht leads the Big West and ranks fourth in the nation with seven wins and boasts a 2.75 ERA. His 69 strikeouts are also the best in the league. Junior right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln has also been a reliable arm out the pen, especially in the clutch, as his eight saves are tied for the league high. Freshman pitcher Michael McGreevy, the usual first pitcher out of the pen for the ""òChos, currently possesses the best ERA in the league with a 1.57. The Aggies are led by sophomore infielder Tanner Murray at the plate, who leads the team with a .427 BA with one home run and 14 RBIs. He earned a Big West Field Player of the Week honor earlier this season. The pitching staff is led by Friday starter Brett Erwin who is 3-3 with a 2.79 ERA. As a team, the Aggies hit .280 and have a team ERA of 5.76. Overall, UCSB has proven how good it is this season, especially at home where the team is 17-1. Now, Santa Barbara can't afford to take its foot off the pedal. It has to continue the pace it is playing at, lock up a Big West title, and who knows what else. Maybe it's second ever host for a regional or even its first host for a Super Regional. UCSB will begin its series against UC Davis at 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 18 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Game two will commence at 3 p.m. on Friday while game three will start at 1 p.m. on Saturday at the same location.

sports,Struggling Gauchos Look To Keep LBSU Offense In Check,18-Apr-19,4:31 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-18/struggling-gauchos-look-to-keep-lbsu-offense-in-check/,"Sierra Altmeyer makes contact with the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The Gauchos will look to bounce back from a series sweep at the hands of Hawaii as they travel down to Long Beach to play their next series against Long Beach State. UCSB's 7-33 overall record and 1-8 conference record puts it in eighth place in the Big West, while LBSU sits in fifth place with a 17-21 overall record and a 4-5 record in conference. Both teams are still trying to gain some positive momentum as they get deeper into Big West play, as LBSU has only won one series in conference play so far, while UCSB is still looking for its first series win of the season.  The Gauchos will ride the bats of Sammy Fabian and Maci Fines in the hopes of finally breaking out on offense, as they have yet to score more than three runs in any Big West matchup so far this season. Sammy Fabian's bat has cooled off slightly from an incredible .473 non-conference average to just .286 since the start of conference play, but she did go 3-9 in the last series against Hawaii and was just one of two Gauchos to record a multiple hit game against the Rainbow Wahine. Sophomore Maci Fines has also solidified herself as one of the more consistent hitters in UCSB's lineup, as she has held steady throughout the whole season and is second on the team with a .250 batting average in conference play. If Santa Barbara wants to show some improvement and win more games down the stretch, it will need more hitters to step up and produce, because by only scoring 10 runs in its first nine conference games, the pitching staff has fielded a lot of pressure to keep games within reach. Run support and strong outings from the pitchers will be especially key for the Gauchos as they try to slow down arguably the best offense in the Big West. LBSU has four hitters inside the top 15 in terms of batting average in the conference, all hitting above .336 on the season. The Beach's lineup is spearheaded by Jamie Wren, whose .367 batting average ranks seventh in the Big West. She also ranks in the top 10 in runs, hits, doubles, home runs, RBIs and total bases. As a team, Long Beach ranks first in overall batting average, hits and doubles, and it has proven to be elite at putting the ball in play as it has the least amount of strikeouts in the entire conference.  The Gauchos will have to look to exploit Long Beach's pitching staff, which has been its most notable weakness on an otherwise well-rounded team. Through nine Big West games, Long Beach ranks last in terms of combined ERA at 4.63, as opposed to UCSB, whose 3.56 mark ranks sixth in the conference. LBSU has a potent offense that can put up runs in a hurry, but its pitching staff has been unable to keep opponents at bay, and that is where it is limited as a team. Long Beach has given up five or more runs in five of its nine conference games, and it has a 1-4 record in those games. If there is any team that UCSB's offense can break out of its slump against, it is a team like Long Beach that has had a lot of difficulty limiting the scoring of its opponents. The Gauchos will look to gain some momentum on the road before returning home for two consecutive series following this one.  The series against Long Beach will begin with a doubleheader on Friday, April 19, with the first game starting at 1 p.m., followed by the series finale on Saturday.

sports,Five-Set Triumph Earns Gauchos a Spot in Big West Semis,19-Apr-19,7:36 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/five-set-triumph-earns-gauchos-a-spot-in-big-west-semis/," Last †night featured all the drama and excitement that was expected in a postseason quarterfinals, where the Gauchos took on the Matadors for a semifinal spot in the Big West Men's Volleyball Championship. Ultimately, UCSB would be the ones to come out on top of it all, with a 3-2 victory, after five thrilling sets of volleyball. They're moving on to a semifinal matchup against Long Beach State, while CSUN's season is now concluded following their elimination. Key players for the Gauchos in this one were freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox and junior opposite Keenan Sanders. Wilcox finished with a team high 15 kills on a kill percentage of .419; the team collectively finished with a hitting percentage of .398 as well. Keenan Sanders was expected to play an impact role in this matchup. Along with 12 total kills to his name, Sanders also finished with a game-high 12 blocks against the Matadors. Going forward, both players are sure to keep producing for their side as the Gauchos will face their toughest challenge in their semifinal matchup against Long Beach State. The first set began in a closely fought fashion. By the score mark of 10-10, there had already been 8 different instances where the teams had brought the scores back to level. Soon after, the Gauchos started to slowly chip away at this and break free for a small lead of their own. Off a setup by Wilcox, junior setter Randy DeWeese earned a kill that would bring UCSB's lead to 5, at 15-20. The Matadors would only go on to manage a single other point before the set was closed out and the Gauchos had earned a 1-0 start with a final set score of 25-16. CSUN would go on to bring that initial intensity back as the second set proved even closer than the first. With leads never surpassing more than two points at any moment in this set, the Gauchos found themselves constantly trailing without being able to find a rhythm of their own. It wasn't until DeWeese assisted a kill by Wilcox late in the set that the Gauchos manage to bring things all level at 18-18. Still, the lead continued to evade UCSB but they managed to tie the match up four more times through the remainder of the set. Ultimately, the Matadors managed to close out this one as the final set score came in at 27-25 and the set tally on the night stood at 1-1. The third set similarly followed the nail biting trend, as it once again took extra points to decide the set victor. The Matadors looked to build off the momentum from the previous set, and once more it was the Gauchos who were trailing for the majority of it. It wasn't until the 17-17 mark that UCSB found its first tie of the set, off a kill by Spencer Fredrick set up by DeWeese. The Gauchos would go on to earn a slight 2-point lead deep into the third set, but unfortunately they couldn't get the job done in the final moments as the Matadors snatched this one at 28-26. Now in a make or break set, the Gauchos started the fourth set in inspired form as they raced out to a 15-6 lead following excellent offensive play and several mistakes on CSUN's end. As the set progressed UCSB's lead did as well, Sanders and senior outside hitter Corey Chavers lead their side to a 25-13 set victor, a performance worthy of a top-4 program. With the set tally all even at 2-2, a fifth set was needed to decide this quarterfinals matchup, and the Gauchos were up to the task once more. Again, UCSB raced out to another massive early lead, and another Spencer kill assisted by DeWeese brought the score to 11-3. At this point it was far too late for the Matadors to salvage their season. However, at game point, CSUN found a second-wind of four scores in a row that brought the tally to 14-9. Nevertheless, the Gauchos got the job done at 15-9, earning themselves a 3-2 matchup win that advances them to the Big West Semifinals. Next up for No. 4 UCSB is a meeting with the best in the nation, No. 1 Long Beach State. This semifinal bout will be the Gauchos' biggest challenge of the season yet, with both teams hungry for a playoff finals spot, this one's shaping up to be another stellar opportunity for elite college volleyball. UCSB and Long Beach State are set to duke it out tonight, April 19th, at 8 PM, in the tournament location of Honolulu, Hawai'i.

sports,Legends Never Die: A Reflection on the Retirement of Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki,19-Apr-19,7:29 PM,['Leonard Paulasa'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/legends-never-die-a-reflection-on-the-retirement-of-dwayne-wade-and-dirk-nowitzki/,"On April 10, 2019, NBA superstars and future Hall of Famers Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki played the final games of their legendary careers. Both players are revered and respected by owners, general managers, coaches, players and fans alike.  While they played for different teams, their careers were intertwined and it was almost destined for them to retire in the same year. Dirk Nowitzki was drafted from Germany in 1998 and would spend all 21 years of his NBA career playing for the Dallas Mavericks. His first year was a rough transition and many doubted he'd bloom into the player he was initially expected to become. Nevertheless, Dirk would continually improve and lead the Mavs to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2006. The opposing team would be led by Dwyane Wade who was drafted in 2003 ""î considered to be one of the most star-studded drafts in NBA history. Wade's impact was immediate and in just his third year as a professional, he would lead the Miami Heat to their first finals appearance against Dirk's Mavericks. The Mavs were the favorites and won the first two games convincingly to take a 2-0 series lead. However, Wade would rise to the occasion and lead the Heat to the promised land. Miami would win the next four games and were crowned champions, and Wade was awarded the finals MVP award for his performance. Both players proved that they earned their stardom by reaching the finals but would struggle to recreate their success for the next five years. Be that as it may, Wade had written himself into NBA history, while Nowitzki's career was plagued by ""úwhat-ifs""ù and almosts. Many ""î including myself ""î thought it was likely that he'd ended his career without ever winning a championship.  In 2011, however, Dirk proved naysayers wrong by completing what is undoubtedly one of the most legendary championship runs in NBA history.  In the finals, Dirk's Mavs and Wade's Heat ""î revamped by adding superstars LeBron James and Chris Bosh during the offseason ""î would meet again, and this time the Heat were the clear favorites. Yet Dirk would cement his name in history by playing like a man possessed, defeating the juggernauts in six games and rightfully earning his finals MVP. Both players are considered to be some of the best to ever play the game of basketball. Wade is considered to be one of the top four shooting guards of all time. He's personally my favorite player, and I've been watching him play since the day he entered the league. His 16 years have brought me great joy, and his actions on and off the court not only inspired me and many others, but also made me proud to call him a role model. On the other hand, Dirk has been a player I've loved and hated. His dominance in the Western conference brought me pain as I watched him defeat and deny the playoff chances of my hometown team, the Warriors, repeatedly. Yet I always respected his attitude and his loyalty. His move, the one-legged fadeaway, is iconic, feared and loved by many. The way he played the game was graceful, and he paved the way for many Europeans to enter the NBA. I'm thankful to have grown up watching and admiring both not only as athletes, but also as people. They left positive impacts in each of their communities and proved that they're bigger than the sport. As a fan, I'm proud to have had them as role models and am joyous that they're leaving the sport greater than they found it. Thank you Dirk Nowtizki and thank you Dwyane Wade.

sports,"UCSB Looks To Remain Unbeaten in Conference Play, Takes on Hawaii",19-Apr-19,7:34 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-19/ucsb-looks-to-remain-unbeaten-in-conference-play-takes-on-hawaii/,"Chasing the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus Currently undefeated in conference play, the UCSB men's tennis team will round out its Big West season with two final matches versus competitors Cal Poly and Hawai'i. The Gauchos' 3-0 conference record contributes to their even more promising 12-6 overall standing. Cal Poly's almost identical record threatens UC Santa Barbara's spot in the number one seed of the Big West. Both statistically and chronologically, however, Hawai'i seems to be the secondary competitor.  The Rainbow Warriors sit two conference games behind SB, their season marked only by a singular loss in their Big West debut. Overall, the team sports a less than .500 winning percentage, tallying seven wins out of a total 17 games.  Regarding both doubles and singles records, the Gaucho roster statistically dominates that of the Rainbow Warriors. The Gauchos have seen ongoing success from their three most dominant pairings, which together have accumulated over half of the total wins this season. Of these, junior-sophomore duo Joseph Guillin and Victor Krustev arguably contribute most consistently to this domination. The year-old pairing is the only one to see time in all three Big West matches, and if it weren't for an intermittent loss in the non-conference match against No. 46 Cal Berkeley, the two would be handily sporting an 11-match win streak.  Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm pose a similar threat to the Rainbow Warriors. Both incredibly strong players on their own, the senior pairing exemplifies a vital combination of precision and experience. Earlier in the season, the co-captains defeated the No. 17 pairing in the country, Jacob Brumm and Yuta Kikuchi of Cal. Wins in the upcoming two games could push their win streak to six.  As singles players, the two seniors remain among the top three most consistent players the Gauchos have to offer.  A defending First Team All-Conference player ""î for singles and doubles ""î 2018 Big West Player of the Year and No. 6-ranked ITA Division I athlete, Moreno de Alboran brings measurable skill to the Gauchos' roster. He currently leads his team in match victories, totaling 24 on the season, and even holds above a 0.500 winning percentage versus national players.  Holm will go into the weekend with six straight singles victories ""î five of which were two-game sweeps. There is hardly a comparable duo or single on the opposing roster to those seen on Santa Barbara's. In the last three matchups versus the Rainbow Warriors, the home team's seemingly impenetrable lineup has swept its competitor 7-0.  Since last facing each other, however, Hawai'i has added a crucial player to its squad: freshman Andre Ilagan. In dual matches, the rookie tops his teammates by securing 11 wins and only five losses ""î the only player with an above .500 winning percentage. Earlier in the season, Ilagan was named Big West Conference Athlete of the Week.  With a much more seasoned Santa Barbara team, it should be interesting to see the route that Gaucho Head Coach Marty Davis takes when selecting a competitor for Ilagan.  UCSB must also look out for sophomore Blaz Seric, who as of two weeks ago was named BWC Player of the Week following outstanding performances against UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Riverside. Seric finds himself on a hot streak that could be tough to break; for seven games now, the 6'7""ù standout has crushed his competition in both doubles and singles play.  Ultimately, the finale of the Gauchos' Big West Conference play will depend both on their performance against Cal Poly and Hawai'i. Though traditionally Hawai'i has not been as intimidating a competitor as Cal Poly, the ""òBows, as always, bring to the court players eager to win and boost their own conference status.  The UCSB men's tennis team will face Hawai'i at home on Sunday, April 21, at 1 p.m., with the hopes of solidifying a No. 1 conference placement.

Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The UCSB softball team came close to their first Big West series win but ended up falling just short against Long Beach State in the series finale after splitting the first two games. With this series in the books, UCSB still finds themselves in last place in the Big West with a conference record of 2-10 to go along with their 8-35 mark for the season.  The Friday night doubleheader started out well for the Gauchos as they bested Long Beach by a score of 6-2. A brilliant outing from junior pitcher Felisha Noriega was a major factor in the Gauchos' win as she threw 4.2 innings and allowed no runs to score on only two hits given up.† Noriega was given an immediate three-run cushion from her offense in the first inning, something that that Gauchos have struggled to do all season.  All three first-inning runs were scored by bases-loaded walks given up by Long Beach pitcher Devyn Magnett, as the Gauchos succeeded in putting considerable early pressure on a LBSU pitching staff that has struggled as of late. UCSB scored another run in the top of the third on a sacrifice fly by senior infield Melanie Menor to make it 4-0 Gauchos.  Three Gauchos, sophomore infield Maci Fines, junior infield Devan Sperry and junior infield Kayla Krantz, recorded multiple hits in an offensive outburst by Santa Barbara. Both teams put up a run in the sixth and seventh innings before a popup with runners on second and third ended the game for Long Beach, and UCSB hung on to win 6-2.  The second game of the evening ran less smoothly for UCSB as they were unable to contain Long Beach's offense any longer, falling to the 49ers 6-1.  The Gauchos could not find the spark they had in the game before as they only recorded five hits as a team, as opposed to the 10 hits they had in the previous game. Long Beach was up 2-0 after the second inning thanks to a solo homer by Nichole Fry in the first, followed by an RBI single by Katelyn Hanson in the second.  Both teams were then quiet until the fifth inning where Fry racked up another RBI on a sacrifice fly to give the 49ers a 3-0 advantage late in the game. UCSB threatened in the sixth as they brought the tying run to the plate but were only able to cut the deficit to 3-1 in favor of Long Beach. A pair of homers for LBSU in the sixth put the game away for good as Maddy Ruffin and Taylor Rowland both went yard for the final runs of the game to secure a 6-1 Long Beach win. The final game of the three-game set proved to be the most entertaining of the series, as UCSB used a four-run fourth inning to propel themselves to a 5-0 advantage entering the fifth. The Gauchos put up their runs thanks to three one-run singles and a two-run double by Fines, and they looked to have broken away from Long Beach for the second time in three games.  The 49ers threatened in the fifth and loaded the bases in the sixth, but only managed to score two runs and cut the deficit to 5-2. That is before a nightmare inning for UCSB allowed Long Beach to score four runs off of three walks, a hit by pitch, a sac fly and two singles, culminating with a walk-off two-run single by Maddy Ruffin to seal the deal and win the series for LBSU by a score of 6-5.  The Gauchos will look to bounce back against Cal State Northridge as they return home to play a three-game series against the Matadors next Saturday.

Photo courtesy of ITA Tennis. For its fourth year in a row, the UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team swept through their Big West competitors, finishing number one in conference rankings with a spotless 5-0 record.  The Gauchos (14-6 overall) closed out their undefeated conference season first with an at-home 4-0 win against Cal Poly and then with a 6-1 defeat over University of Hawai'i. Hawai'i, now 1-4 in conference and 7-12 overall, fills the last place spot in Big West rankings, while Cal Poly (4-1 in conference) sits below SB.  From Sunday's start, the Gauchos seemed to control the match. No. 1 duo Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm immediately took down Hawaii's arguably best pairing, Andre Ilagan and Lucas Labrunie. Despite having seen the most court time as a team throughout the season ""î and maintaining a 7-6 overall record""î the inexperienced doubles found it difficult to compete with their nationally-ranked Santa Barbara counterparts.  Consequently, Moreno de Alboran and Holm will head into Big West Championships with six straight wins behind them. Their latest victory boosted their overall record to 12-8 and their dual record to 9-6.  Equally as competitive as this duo, however, are their fellow teammates Joseph Guillin and Victor Krustev. Though as a pair they have played five fewer matches than the former (12-3 overall), the SB doubles team has seen tremendous success in dual matches.  The junior-sophomore team defeated University of Hawaii's Blaz Seric and Sim√£o Telo Alves 6-2, ending their season with a 10-1 mark ""î the most impressive dual match record seen in the Gaucho roster. Guillin and Krustev's latest four wins from Big West play have helped to maintain their team's ongoing success throughout the season. The Rainbow Warriors' Seric and Telo Alves, on the other hand, have not seen such success lately. The doubles team played in only two matches during conference season and lost both.  The UC Santa Barbara lineup dominated singles rounds as well, picking up wins in five of its six matchups versus Hawaii. Over the five Big West games, the singles players have accumulated a combined 17 wins and only three losses.  Gaucho freshman Luka Vukmanovic made his NCAA dual-match debut against Hawaii's Asad Siyyid. The freshman's fight looked promising after he forced Siyyid into three sets after claiming a 6-4 win on the second. Ultimately, however, Vukmanovic lost and marked the single defeat of the day.  Head Coach Marty Davis sent his top player, No. 15 Moreno de Alboran, to meet Hawaii's freshman standout, Andre Ilagan. The senior beat Ilagan 6-0, 6-3 and consequently finished his singles season losing only one of 12 matches.  Prior to Big West, Ilagan's impressive record (11-4) reflected his even more impressive performance, especially for being new to NCAA. †However, his three-time appearance in conference has resulted in an 0-3 record, as he is now faced with seasoned competitors like Moreno de Alboran and Cal Poly's senior Josh Ortlip.  Senior Hironori Koyanagi, sophomore Krusetv, junior Guillin and redshirt-sophomore Joseph Rotheram all dominated across the courts, each clinching wins against their respective opponents for Santa Barbara.  The next step? The Gauchos will head to the Indian Wells Court to compete in the Big West Championships; here, the team will fight for its fifth consecutive tournament title. The team is simultaneously looking into its potential to place into this year's NCAA tournament. The upcoming championships, however, should remain the biggest priority as the Santa Barbara faces a TBD opponent in the semi-finals on Friday, April 26.

This was the third meeting between the two sides this year, and ultimately for the third time, the victory would go to the defending champion 49ers. As a result, UCSB's postseason aspirations have now come to an end in the Big West Semis; Long Beach State would go on to become conference championship runner-ups after falling to No. 1 Hawai'i in five sets. For the Gauchos, red shirt junior middle blocker Brandon Hopper and senior outside hitter Corey Chavers were the key contributors in this semifinal matchup; these two players were the only double-digit scorers for UCSB. Hopper finished with a team-high kill percentage of .533, tallying 10 kills to his name on the evening. Meanwhile, Chavers was once again a productive force as he finished with a team-high final kill count of 13; he also tallied a team-high 2 service aces. Friday evening's semifinal got off to an exciting start as both sides were clawing back and forth for a first set lead. The score was brought all level, at the 10-10 mark, off a Chavers kill set up by junior setter Randy DeWeese; prior to this, the set was tied twice with Long Beach State's lead never surpassing more than 3 scores. Following this, the 49ers would go on to scrape back their three-point lead. However, following a UCSB timeout, the Gauchos would find a scoring streak of their own and bring it back all level once more at 15-15. Unfortunately, a 49er timeout of their own seemingly corrected their mistakes and Long Beach State slowly began to run away with the set shortly after. The set would eventually go to the defending champs at 25-19 as Long Beach State started off the evening semifinal at a set score of 1-0. The second set went much more in UCSB's favor, as the Gauchos quickly jumped out to a 6-3 lead. Still, in a set riddled with attacking and service errors, Long Beach State would still manage to tie it back up at 11-11. Thanks to DeWeese assists and the offensive efforts of Hopper, the Gauchos would manage to regain their several point lead. A set-ending kill by Gaucho freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox would then earn UCSB its first and only victory at 25-21, thus bringing the set tally level at 1-1. The previous set's result must have refocused the 49ers as they found their intensity once more in the third. The Gauchos' had a short-lived lead to start the third set, but following the tied score, at 5-5, Long Beach State would go on to maintain a several point lead throughout the remainder of the set. UCSB couldn't find their rhythm and escape that catch-up mode, as the third set was dropped to the 49ers by a score of 25-18. Now in the fourth set, the Gauchos put on a make or break performance. UCSB once again came out with the early lead, but errors on their behalf kept Long Beach State in the set. Lead by the 49ers' senior opposite/outside hitter Kyle Ensing, who finished with a game-high 18 kills, and senior setter Josh Tuaniga, Long Beach State asserted their dominance as a top-2 program and again ran away with it late in the set. Eventually, the set and matchup would conclude at 25-17 as the semifinal went 3-1 to the 49ers. Following this semifinal exit, the Gauchos were hoping for an NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship bid to keep their postseason alive. Unfortunately, only Hawai'i, Long Beach State, Pepperdine, USC, Lewis, Princeton, and Barton were called upon. Long Beach State would go on to lose 3-2 to Hawai'i in the Big West Men's Championship game. With the season now wrapped up, UCSB managed a finish as a top-5 program in the nation. On the season, the Gauchos finished with an 18-10 overall record and a 4-5 conference record in the Big West.

sports,"Top-Seeded Gauchos Look to Win Conference Tournament, Clinch Postseason Berth",22-Apr-19,5:51 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-22/top-seeded-gauchos-look-to-win-conference-tournament-clinch-postseason-berth/,"Stephanie Yamada lunges for a short ball. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus For the second straight season, the UCSB women's tennis team secured the Big West regular season title. This time, however, they will look to parlay that regular season success into a tournament title and a postseason berth. With their 4-0 sweep over rivals Cal Poly on Saturday, the Gauchos clinched the top seed in the Big West tournament, finishing the regular season with an impressive 7-1 conference record. Fittingly, senior Stephanie Yamada won the deciding game in her last ever home game, knocking off her opponent in two sets and getting a post-match Gatorade bath to top it all off. Now the winner of four consecutive matches, Santa Barbara heads into the Big West tournament with confidence and momentum on their side. On Friday, the Gauchos will kick off their postseason campaign against either UC Irvine or UC Riverside. On paper, neither team should give Santa Barbara much trouble. Just weeks prior, the ""òChos went into Riverside and knocked off the Highlanders 7-0. A week later, SB returned home to defeat UC Irvine 5-1. While the Anteaters struggled in conference play, they went 12-5 in non-conference this year and seem the likelier opponent for UCSB on Friday. Inconsistency has plagued Irvine all season ""î especially on court one, where UCI has struggled to a 10-13 record. On the other hand, junior Amit Lev Ari has dominated all season at the one spot for the Gauchos, coming into the postseason with a 6-1 record on the top court. Another advantage for SB will be at the five spot, where Yamada has settled nicely after some early-season struggles. Yamada remains unbeaten when playing on court five; on the other hand, Irvine has failed to find a consistent contributor for this spot, with the team sporting an 11-11 record on the fifth court this season. In the earlier matchup between these teams, the Gauchos completed all of their victories in only two sets, while Irvine's lone victory came due to a forfeit on court six. If UCSB can get past the quarterfinals, they will take on either fourth-seeded Hawai'ior fifth-seeded UC Davis in the semifinals. Historically, Hawai'i has caused problems for SB; last season, the fourth-seeded Rainbow Wahine knocked off the top-seeded Gauchos in a 4-3 nailbiter. Earlier this year, Hawai'i handed UCSB its lone conference defeat, hammering Santa Barbara 6-1 in Honolulu. In that match, Petra Melounova ""î a junior who has been ranked in the top 100 at various points this year ""î handed Lev Ari her sole loss on court one. While almost every match went three sets, the defeat certainly proves that Hawai'i has the skill to knock off UCSB once again this postseason. Santa Barbara may want to root for UC Davis to knock off Hawai'i, as UCSB defeated the Aggies 5-1 earlier this season. While the doubles point was canceled because of inclement weather, Davis's sole victory came on court one, where junior Nikita Pradeep knocked off sophomore Elizaveta Volodko despite dropping the first set. If the Gauchos can advance, UCSB will move on to the title game for the second time in the last three years. In 2017, the Gauchos knocked off the top-seeded Rainbow Wahine to advance to the NCAA tournament, where the ""òChos were swept in the opening round by UCLA. With a 13-7 overall record and a deep and talented roster, UCSB has dominated their Big West opponents all season. If they can keep up their hot play, Santa Barbara may very well find itself in the NCAA tournament field at the end of the weekend. The Gauchos will kick off play Friday morning, when the ""òChos take on either UC Irvine or UC Riverside at 8:30 a.m. at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Comments are closed.

sports,The Breanna Stewart Tragedy,23-Apr-19,12:52 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-23/the-breanna-stewart-tragedy/,"Seattle Storm forward Breanna Stewart (30) takes a free throw. I am personally responsible for Breanna Stewart tearing her Achilles over the weekend in the EuroLeague title game. No, I wasn't guarding Stewart when the injury occurred. In fact, I wasn't even in the same country at the time.  Yet, I still find myself at fault for what happened. With a base WNBA salary equivalent to that of a grade school teacher, Stewart was forced to play overseas to make a living ""î as almost all WNBA players are. After leading her Russian team Dynamo Kursk to the title game, Stewart rolled up on fellow WNBA star Britney Griner, rupturing her Achilles in the process. Just months prior, Stewart had experienced one of the highs of her young career, lifting the WNBA championship trophy for the first time as the Seattle Storm swept the Washington Mystics, earning finals MVP in the process. During the regular season, Stewart averaged 21.8 ppg and 8.4 rpg en-route to earn league MVP honors.  Now, because she played in a game that a player of her caliber should not have to play in to make a decent living, Stewart loses a valuable year of her prime, the Seattle Storm lose their superstar for the season and the WNBA loses one of their most marketable players. Again, all because of a devastating injury that should never have occurred. How is it possible that the MVP of the premier women's basketball league in the world doesn't make more than $56,000? It starts with a faulty collective bargaining agreement (CBA) ""î one that can, should and will likely change in the coming years.  When WNBA players complain about their salary in comparison to their male counterparts, they don't expect to get equal pay; obviously, the men's game makes more money. No, what they want is a similar share of the profits. In the NBA, 50 percent of the total money is allocated to player salaries; in the WNBA, that number hovers around 20 percent. Double Stewart's salary, and maybe she wouldn't have to play overseas ""î instead opting to give her body a much deserved rest. But that doesn't explain the whole story, including why the WNBA has consistently lost money over the past 10 years. For that, I blame myself. I've always tried to advocate for women's basketball; as a 12-year-old, I vividly remember writing in my journal, trying to make a successful marketing plan for the WNBA. What I failed to understand as a young, naive kid was the nature of the main force holding the WNBA back: sexism. We've all heard the common arguments made by men against women's basketball: it's boring, the women can't dunk and,""úI'm a waaaay better basketball player than these women.""ù The last point especially pisses me off, because it manifests itself even in pickup basketball. One of my best friends plays pickup with me weekly, and every time she makes a shot, the game always stops for a minute so everybody can clap and congratulate her. In reality, she's played more minutes of organized basketball than they ever will in their lives. This year, I had the privilege of beat-writing for the UCSB women's basketball team, and I saw first-hand the skill, effort and tactics that went into a game. I will guarantee that freshman point guard Danae Miller could cross over anyone I know, regardless of gender. As for the first two arguments, women's basketball may be played below the rim, but that makes it no less exciting to hoop nerds like myself. Because there is less reliance on raw athleticism, WNBA players are some of the craftiest finishers around the rim. And in stark contrast to the men's game, the women's game relies much less on the three-pointer, which is very refreshing to watch. Now, back to my opening sentence: I blame myself because I haven't done nearly enough to combat this sexism. Yes, I tell my friends they're dead wrong when they say they can beat women in one-on-ones, but that shouldn't be seen as an accomplishment. In my six years of being a part of the press, this is my first-ever WNBA article. That needs to change. I challenge any basketball fan who is reading this article to watch a WNBA game with an open mind and see what you think. Rather than deriding the players for their inability to dunk, praise them for their backdoor passes, their ridiculous finishes near the rim and their ability to knock down big three's with the clock winding down. Breanna Stewart tore her Achilles because men refuse to give women's basketball a chance, and because men who do support women's basketball haven't done an effective job in advocating for the sport. That changes now. WNBA is a joke. WNBA requires just as much fundamentals, and the way the play the game is beautiful my friend. Who? Great article! Thank you for bringing awareness and attention to this issue.

sports,"Gauchos Look To Build On Positive Momentum, Face Matadors",25-Apr-19,8:15 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/gauchos-look-to-build-on-positive-momentum-face-matadors/,"Sierra Altmeyer makes contact with the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The UCSB softball team will look to bounce back from a tough series loss last weekend as they take on Cal State Northridge in a three game series starting on Saturday. The Gauchos are reeling from a devastating series loss in which they let Long Beach come back in the final game to steal the win away from them. However, they did take a step in the right direction with a pair of solid offensive outputs over their last three games.  Their upcoming opponent, CSUN, is looking to pick up some momentum as we head down the stretch in conference play after earning their first Big West series win of the season against Cal Poly last weekend. The Matadors are 5-7 in the Big West which puts them in a tie for fifth with UC Riverside, while the Gauchos are still sitting in last place, with their 2-10 conference record placing them just one game behind Cal Poly.  UCSB will look to build on what was a stellar offensive series in Long Beach where they scored five runs or more in two of the three games, a feat that they had not accomplished once in conference play before then. One of the main reasons for the Gauchos' offensive outbreak was junior infielder Devan Sperry's arguably best series of the season, going 5-11 with multiple hits in two of the games; she became a much-needed contributor to a team that desperately needed more run production. Sophomore infielder Maci Fines also had a stellar series as she recorded a hit in each game, solidifying herself as one of the most consistent producers on the team.  An encouraging note for UCSB is that sophomore outfielder Sammy Fabian is due to get back to her old ways and start hitting again as she has cooled off after she was nearly unstoppable earlier in the year. Fabian is hitting .397 on the season but just .250 in conference play, as she has been unable to put together consistent at-bats as of late. This is encouraging for the team because they seem to be improving on offense even with their best hitter being in a bit of a slump. If she can break out along with the rest of her teammates, the Gauchos might be able to peak near the end of the season and surprise some folks. Cal State Northridge also has some positive momentum going their way, however, as they were able to claim their first Big West series victory of the season mainly due to the great work of their pitching staff. Northridge is not the deepest squad in the Big West by any means; however, they have a pair of quality pitchers to look out for along with possibly the most dangerous hitter in the entire conference. CSUN has two pitchers that rank in the top 10 in the Big West in terms of E.R.A. Sophomore Kenedee Jamerson's 3.19 mark puts her at ninth overall, and sophomore pitcher Jillian James and her 2.15 E.R.A. is good for fourth in the league. James is the clear ace of the staff, as she leads the entire conference in innings pitched, with 172.1, †and she is also second overall with 187 strikeouts. Aside from the pitchers, the one person who the team should gameplan for is junior outfielder and pitcher Megan Stevens, who bats .455 on the season with 47 runs batted in. These stats, paired with her 12 home runs on the season, demonstrate the power and skill of Stevens, but it is more important to stress that no one else on her team hits over .300, so if the Gaucho pitchers can neutralize her, they will put themselves in a position to win. The three-game set begins with a Saturday doubleheader starting at 1 p.m. at Campus Diamond.

sports,No. 4 UCSB Opens Up Big West Tourney Against No. 5 LBSU,25-Apr-19,4:59 PM,['Nithesh Perumal'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/no-4-ucsb-opens-up-big-west-tourney-against-no-5-lbsu/,"Allison Fann/Daily Nexus No. 4 UCSB will head into Long Beach State Friday April 26 commencing the quarterfinals of the Big West Tournament. Santa Barbara will look to carry their momentum from a convincing win against LBSU this past Saturday at home. In their 6-3 win against LBSU, the ""òChos showed both their stout defense and high powered offense. LBSU was nearly out played by every meaningful metric of the contest. The ""òChos shot 16% 22% better, gave up one less foul, converted on 100% of their penalty opportunities and did all of this attempting fewer shots than LBSU. The low scoring nature of the match less reflects its toughness and is more indicative of the patient and calculated offense UCSB has established to complement their stifling defense. This complete team is driven by high-level play and leadership from upperclassmen on both sides of the ball. Junior utility Sarah Snyder and senior utility Kate Pipkin have both put together statement seasons on the offensive side of the ball for the ""òChos. Snyder ended her hat trick streak this past game. Pipkin has been a model of unparalleled consistency by putting up her third straight season with 40+ goals. On the other side of the ball UCSB's goalies have been phenomenal this season, making an impact on every game that they check in for. In the most recent of these games senior goalie Kenzi Snyder posted an impressive 75% save percentage against LBSU. The confidence and skills the upperclassmen bring to the water have trickled down into the underclassmen, who have all shown their own ability to compete at a high level despite having less experience than a lot of their competitors. This unique mix of upper and underclassmen playing top-of-the-pack defense and still packing a punch offensively is what makes the ""òChos aim to go far in this year's Big West Tournament. Even though the team was not able to secure a first round bye with a win over Davis a few games prior, the added pressure has molded this UCSB team into a dynamic powerhouse. Despite the strong play from UCSB, no team in the Big West Tournament should be taken lightly. It is imperative that the ""òChos come out of the gates ready to go on both offense and defense. One of UCSB's concerns going into not just this game but also to the Big West Tournament as a whole is to make sure to control the tempo of the game right from the start of the match all the way to the end. Many of the UCSB losses this season have occurred because of losing pace early and having to play catch-up after the half. With many qualified teams competing in this year's tournament, taking an early deficit is ill advised and will likely lead to an untimely defeat. On the bright side, all the ""òChos need to do to be successful this weekend is play the way they played against LBSU. By controlling the tempo and initiating a patient yet efficient offense on top of a stifling defense, UCSB can definitely look to dominate the competition in this year's tournament. Santa Barbara will ride their momentum from last Saturday's win to April 26 when they replay LBSU, this time with some more added stakes at 1 p.m.

sports,No. 6 Gauchos Look to Extend New Program Win Streak at UC Riverside,25-Apr-19,5:06 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/no-6-gauchos-look-to-extend-new-program-win-streak-at-uc-riverside/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Three days ago, the No. 6 UCSB baseball team set a new program record for most consecutive wins in a single season with 13 following a 4-1 at Cal State Bakersfield. Still, the season still has a ways to go as Santa Barbara will look to continue one of its best seasons in program history when it takes on UC Riverside. Saying the Gauchos are in the midst of their best season ever is not much of an overstatement at this point considering they are off to their best start in school history with a 31-5 overall record. UCSB is also sitting atop the Big West standings with an 8-1 conference record following sweeps of UC Davis, UC Irvine and taking two of three at CSUF. In previous years, Santa Barbara going on the road would be enough to worry about the team faring well. In fact, before this year, UCSB was 76-91-1 in the Andrew Checketts era and the last two seasons in particular, the team was an abysmal 13-33. This year, the Gauchos are 11-4 and if they win four of their final nine road matches that would be the most road wins in the Checketts era. This week, UCSB will take on a UCR team that is struggling. The Highlanders are currently 13-25 overall and sit at seventh in the conference with a 3-6 Big West mark. UCR is a much better 6-6 at home compared to a 7-19 record away from Riverside. Still, if UCR has any hopes of upsetting a hot UCSB team then it will need to focus on taking away its strong bats. Through its nine conference games, Santa Barbara is slashing .318/.372/.538. Specifically, the Gauchos .318 batting average and .538 slugging is first in the conference while its .372 on base percentage is second only behind Fullerton. Counting all games, not just conference, the Gauchos are the best team in the conference in nearly all statistics such as: batting average (.290), on-base percentage (.383), slugging percentage (.495), home runs (42), RBI's (232), doubles (74), triples (22) and runs (258). Tommy Jew is one of the players directly responsible for this strong Gaucho offense. The junior center fielder currently sports a strong .296 batting average and in the last four games, he has gone 7-15 at the plate with two RBI's and one home run. His 30 RBI's are tied for the second-most on the team. Jew leads the team in homers with nine on the season and he has also been a terror on the base paths with 16 stolen bases, tied for the team best mark with fellow outfielder Tevin Mitchell. Jew has also been stellar defensively with a perfect fielding percentage and he has also made some great catches including one that stole a home run. Another very hot bat is senior designated hitter/catcher Thomas Rowan who comes into the series opener working a seven-game hit streak. In fact, Rowan has successfully earned a hit in all but six games this season. In the month of April, which UCSB has played in 12 games, Rowan is 18-43 (.418) with 12 RBI's, four home runs, two extra-base hits and striking out just six times in 43 at bats. The senior has also had 14 multiple hit games this season in his 36 appearances. On the mound, the Gauchos do not get much easier. Michael McGreevy has quickly transformed himself into the first guy out of the bullpen for the Gauchos as the freshman sports a Big West best 1.62 ERA. Left-handed Saturday starting pitcher Jack Dashwood has also been hot as of late and was named Big West Pitcher of the Week this past Tuesday following a dominant performance against UC Davis. The sophomore tossed a three-hit, complete game shutout and was actually working a perfect game through seven innings before allowing back-to-back singles. Finally, ace closer Chris Lincoln, whose 10 saves are a league best, was recently named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Stopper of the Year Midseason Watch List. The junior righty currently holds a 4.18 ERA and has struck out 25 batters in just 23.1 innings of work. Still, UCSB does need to watch out for the Highlanders streak hitter, Connor Cannon. The junior right-handed pitcher/first baseman has been on an absolute tear the past two weeks winning back-to-back Big West Field Player of the Week. Last week, Cannon had a slash line of .588/.650/1.235 as he hit three home runs and knocked in 11 runs. He broke UCR's program record for most RBI's in a game with eight against New Mexico on April 19. Overall, this week is just another week for UCSB to inch closer to something it hasn't laid claim to in more than 30 years, a Big West title. There is no time for complacency in conference play. 13 straight wins is great, but nothing compared to the other ambitions this team has. UCSB will take on UC Riverside for game one of the series at 6 p.m. on Friday, April 26 at the Riverside Sports Complex.

sports,Top Storylines To Follow Heading Into the 2019 NFL Draft,25-Apr-19,4:50 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/top-storylines-to-follow-heading-into-the-2019-nfl-draft/,"Photo Courtesy of the NFL Welcome to draft week, where college football's best begin their NFL journey. With an exciting draft class eagerly waiting for Thursday night, some teams will surely find a diamond in the rough, others, not so much. Whether your team is searching for an immediate impact player or just looking to fill roster depth needs, here at the Daily Nexus, we'll quickly sum up all the important storylines you'll need to be up to date and ready for the 2019 NFL Draft. So Many Quarterback Needs, So Little Quarterbacks This draft is going to be very crucial for the various teams in the market for a franchise quarterback. Specifically, teams like the Broncos, Bengals, Dolphins, and Redskins will all hope to be in a spot where they can land their guy at the quarterback position. However, this year doesn't seemingly offer a multitude of quarterbacks that scream ""òfranchise', as compared to previous years. Plus, when you factor in teams like the Patriots with Tom Brady and the Giants with Eli Manning, both of who may be vying for a future replacement to their veteran stars, the demand for this particular position may not necessarily meet the supply. Still, Oklahoma QB Kyler Murray, the projected first overall pick in the draft, and Ohio State QB Dwayne Haskins are the two names that stand out in the first round. Don't be surprised if a team trades up past their competitors in order to secure one of these two players. †††† Don't Sleep on the OL Speaking of franchise quarterbacks, someone's got to protect them. Although selecting an offensive lineman in the first round may not be the flashiest choice to go with, it's still vastly important nonetheless. This is particularly true for my Eagles, who like to believe future Hall of Fame tackle Jason Peters can play for an eternity. For the love of all that is holy, he can't protect Carson Wentz forever, no matter how much we want him to. For this year's draft, especially, there's plenty of talent to go around at the tackle and guard positions; teams would be wise to pay particular attention to these players that just might be defending their trenches for years to come. To name just a few: Alabama guard Jonah Williams, Florida tackle Jawaan Taylor, and Washington State tackle Andre Dillard are all worthy of an early first-round selection. †† The Year of the Defensive Lineman Of all the positions in this year's draft, the depth of talent is most noticeable amongst defensive linemen. I'm not just talking a few scattered picks here and there, but there's a distinct possibility that a quarter of all the first round picks may go to just pass-rushers and run-stoppers alike. Although I can write a long list of immediate-impact players: Ohio State DE Nick Bosa, Michigan DE Rashan Gary, Alabama DT Quinnen Williams, and Kentucky EDGE Josh Allen, all seem to be consensus top-10 picks. Besides the quarterback position, the defensive linemen in this draft are the next likely to warrant a trade up from teams on Thursday night. †† Running Backs Running Into the 2nd Round Spoiler alert: It is not the year of the running back. That being said, the dearth of big names shouldn't take away from the excitement surrounding the prospects at this position, it's just one of those years where none particularly standout and the majority of them may fall to later rounds. Regardless, don't expect your team to address any of these backfield needs this early on into the draft. Although the running back position tends to be undervalued at times due to durability concerns, various teams will still be in the market for these offensive playmakers. If a running back does happen to go in the first round, the Raiders seem to be the most likely suitor in most mock drafts. The Good, The Bad, and The Media When it comes to the Raiders, the media is at it once again. Days before the draft, drama is being stirred up as rumors are circulating concerning Oakland's draft day plans. Specifically the rumor is that they're planning ""úsurprise picks with their three first-round selections""ù. Whether or not you believe this is a ploy purposely leaked from the Raiders' brass, we recommend you don't look to deep into it and just wait for the Draft regardless. On a more blatant note, the Cardinals are also taking part in these pre-Draft shenanigans by suggesting their first overall pick isn't quite settled just yet. Throughout the offseason reports have constantly assured that Kyler Murray will be taken at first overall, mainly because of his ties to Arizona head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Along with these last-minute ""òadjustments' that honestly may just be a ruse to drive up their current quarterback Josh Rosen's trade value, it has also been reported that Murray doesn't like watching film in preparation for game day. Stop it. He's got all the tools to be great in the NFL and his college tape only supports his dedication to the process. So, dear media, let him play and stop trying to ruin his chances at securing the bag.

sports,UCSB Aims For Fifth Consecutive Big West Title,25-Apr-19,8:08 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-25/ucsb-aims-for-fifth-consecutive-big-west-title/,"Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus Last Sunday, the UCSB men's tennis team celebrated their fourth straight regular season title, knocking off Hawaii in front of their home crowd. If all goes according to Head Coach Marty Davis' plan, the Gauchos will be celebrating once again this Sunday after winning their fifth consecutive Big West Conference tournament. After amassing a 5-0 conference record ""î and only dropping three total sets throughout conference play ""î the ""òChos earned the top seed and a first round bye in this year's tournament. As such, Santa Barbara's first match will come on Friday at 3 p.m. against the winner of Thursday's matchup between fourth-seeded UC Riverside and fifth-seeded UC Davis. All year, the Gauchos have leaned on their trio of nationally-ranked athletes: No.16 Nicolas Moreno De Alboran, No.58 Joseph Guillin, and No.115 Victor Krustev. In his senior year, Moreno De Alboran has had yet another stellar year for the team, finishing the season with a 12-2 record on court one. If Moreno De Alboran finishes the season in the top 16, he will become the first UCSB All-American since David Decret in 1992. Junior Guillin and sophomore Krustev have also provided steady contributions from the second and third courts respectively, with the two finishing a combined 19-8 on their best courts. With arguably the three top singles players in the conference ""î and each team only needing four points to secure victory ""î the Gauchos seem on paper to be the clear favorites for the title this weekend. Even on the lower courts, Santa Barbara has seen improved play from some of their veterans. On court six, senior Anders Holm seems to have found his stroke, winning seven straight matches. For any team to knock off the ""òChos, they will likely need to steal the doubles point and establish some momentum heading into singles play. As of late, however, UCSB has dominated doubles play. On court one, Moreno De Alboran and Holm have won their last six matches, while on court two the duo of Guillin and Krustev have a 9-1 overall record on the season. On paper, Santa Barbara shouldn't have too much trouble with their Friday opponent, with the Gauchos sweeping both Davis and Riverside 4-0 in their previous matchup this season. In the match against Riverside, UCSB opted to rest both Moreno de Alboran and Holm ""î something the Highlanders won't have the luxury of this time around. Despite being the higher seed between the two potential opponents, UCR only have a 1-4 conference record, and shouldn't pose too much of a threat to the ""òChos dominance. If Santa Barbara wins Friday, they will get a day off on Saturday before playing in the finals on Sunday at 9 a.m. In that game, the ""òChos will likely take on either UC Irvine or Cal Poly, with the Anteaters arguably posing the biggest threat to UCSB. In the first matchup between the two teams, UCI took two points off the Gauchos, before ultimately falling 4-2. Surprisingly, Krustev was one of the players to lose for UCSB, with sophomore Joseph Rotheram also dropping his match on court five. Still, with no individual nearly as talented as Moreno De Alboran, the Anteaters will need all hands on deck on the other five courts to defeat the Gauchos. If Santa Barbara can win the conference tournament this year, it will be their 12th conference tournament title under Davis in his 19 years as coach. In Moreno De Alboran's last season, and with a postseason berth on the line, look for the Gauchos to come out firing over the weekend in their quest to hoist the trophy for the fifth consecutive season. UCSB will begin their postseason on Friday at 3 p.m. at Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Comments are closed.

sports,"UCSB Knocks Off Davis, Heads To Fifth Consecutive BWT Title Game",28-Apr-19,11:37 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-04-28/ucsb-knocks-off-davis-heads-to-fifth-consecutive-bwt-title-game/,"Chasing the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus Following a bye and a subsequent 4-0 sweep over UC Davis in the semifinal game, the Santa Barbara men's tennis team now heads confidently into their fifth consecutive battle for the Big West Championship. The Gauchos remain once again undefeated in conference and playoffs (15-6, 6-0), riding a five-game win streak. UC Davis ended their season fifth in conference with a 12-11 overall and 1-5 record in league. Killer duo Joseph Guillin and Victor Krustev locked in their tenth victory together versus one of Davis's most threatening pairings: freshman Alex Scemanenco and sophomore Daniel Landa (10-7 overall). Nicolas Moreno De Alboran and Anders Holm solidified the Gauchos' first point in the subsequent doubles match. The seniors took out No. 70 duo David Goulak and Ivan Thamma 6-4, serving them only their fifth loss of the entire season. Goulak and Thamma were Davis's leading competitors and only its second nationally-ranked doubles team in program history. Moreno de Alboran faced Goulak one on one later in the match. Ranked 16th in the nation, the Santa Barbara senior shut down his opponent with ease. He clinched the win in just two sets first 6-0, then 6-2. Though his season is far from over""î with a promising NCAA Regional run approaching""îthe Gaucho has left an undeniable imprint on the men's tennis team. Daniel Landa put up the Aggie's lone first set win in a singles match against sophomore Joseph Rotheram. Rotheram followed the initial defeat with two wins, and another point was tallied for Santa Barbara. In his last and second year playing for the Gauchos, senior Hironori Koyanagi went out with another dual singles win versus UC Davis's Chethan Swanson. His 4-time appearance in conference has resulted in a spotless 4-0 record. The last three of these dual matches have been two-set sweeps on the No. 4 court. This season UC Santa Barbara has demonstrated a skillful command over their opponents, especially in conference (though nothing seems surprising about that). The upcoming championship game has no reason to faze their success. This will be the fourth year in a row that the Gauchos battle Cal Poly for the Big West title. Since their 2015/16 season, Santa Barbara has delivered 4-1, 4-1, and 4-0 wins over the Mustang program. Cal Poly (14-9, 4-1) sits just below SB, seeded second in Big West following a singular dual match defeat at the hands of Santa Barbara itself. In the two lineups' latest matchup, the Gauchos steadily took out the Mustangs 4-0. UC Santa Barbara will have to look out once again for Cal Poly's Josh Ortlip. Though the senior previously fell to Holm and Moreno de Alboran in doubles and singles matches, his current performances have made him the most winning member of the team. Ortlip is coming off of a 6-3 doubles win with partner Dominic Bechard at No. 1 court from their tournament semifinal win. It was junior Antoine Noel, however, that launched Cal Poly into the tournament championship. Against UC Irvine the junior clinched the teams' redeeming 4-2 win, solidifying his already-impressive record at 13-4. The last time Noel faced Santa Barbara he left an unfinished match on the No. 2 court against Joseph Guillon. A victory over the nationally ranked Gaucho would be tough to achieve, but there is no doubt Noel, with momentum on his side, will be eager to start to the fight. Santa Barbara plays Cal Poly today at 9am in Palm Springs for the Big West Tournament championship.

I repeat, FIVE straight tournament titles. UC Santa Barbara's (16-6 overall, 7-0 Big West) 4-0 victory over Cal Poly (14-10 overall, 5-2 Big West) Sunday morning clinched it a spot in the NCAA tournament, where the Gauchos will look to get their first NCAA win since 1998's defeat of Oregon in the Round of 64.  The win today also marks the 32nd straight Big West victory for the Gauchos as Head Coach Marty Davis gets his 10th NCAA tournament win in 16 appearances at Indian Wells. Unfortunately for Cal Poly, its hot finish to the season could not be sustained, as junior Antoine Noel and freshman Gary Vardanyan's doubles win on court two proved to be the Mustangs' only triumph of the day, handing UCSB's junior Joseph Guillin and sophomore Victor Krustev just their second doubles loss of the season.  That loss was also UCSB's first doubles loss to a Big West opponent, though senior co-captains Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm got the Gauchos off to a hot start on the top court with a 6-4 victory over Cal Poly studs Josh Ortlip and Dominic Bechard. That was the tandem's eighth straight match win.  One of only two California natives on the team, sophomore Joseph Rotheram and his Spanish-born doubles partner, junior Alex Dominguez Soto, sealed the deal with a 6-3 win on court three, allowing UCSB to take two of three in the doubles game.  Senior Hironori Koyanagi was the first to leave the court, however, as his prowess was on full display with a 6-1, 6-3 score, giving the Tokyo native five straight singles victories.  No. 58 Guillin redeemed his doubles loss with a dominant 6-0, 7-5 showing that brought UCSB within one of a sweep.  It was No.115 singles player Victor Krustev who, despite losing the lone doubles match alongside Guillin, clinched the championship with a 6-2, 6-4 showing over Cal Poly's Alex Stater. The court win allowed Krustev to improve to 14-4 on the year and 13-4 when on court three.  There's been some talk that this being UCSB's fifth straight Big West title might dampen the excitement, but Head Coach Davis was quick to refute those claims, exclaiming that the ""úspecial group of seniors leading this team want to get it done, for this program, for themselves, for our fans, everyone.""ù  Davis will be looking to add an NCAA win to his illustrious career as the Gauchos seek their first tournament win since the 1998 victory over Oregon.  The NCAA Team Championships will kick off Friday when UCSB takes on Texas Tech in the first round of the tournament.

sports,Multiple Gauchos Take Home Conference Accolades,2-May-19,8:54 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/multiple-gauchos-take-home-conference-accolades/,"UC Santa Barbara's Joseph Guillin and head coach Marty Davisduring 2019 Big West Tennis Championships Day 2 at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Friday, April 26, 2019 in Indian Wells, California. (Photo/Josh Barber) After dominating their competition on the court all season, the UCSB men's tennis team continued their dominance off the court on Wednesday, winning a number of end-of-season conference accolades. Most notably, for the second season in a row senior Nicolas Moreno De Alboran was named the Big West Player of the Year, marking only the second time in school history that a Gaucho has won the award in consecutive seasons. Moreno De Alboran finished the season with a 14-3 dual singles record, and currently presides as the No.16 player in the country. Moreno De Alboran will take part in the NCAA singles championship later this month as a top-16 seed. For the fourth consecutive season, Head Coach Marty Davis was named the Big West Coach of the Year. With the accolade, Davis has now won the award in 11 of the 20 seasons he has coached the Gauchos ""î a feat that will likely never be matched. Alongside Moreno De Alboran, junior Joseph Guillin and sophomore Victor Krustev both received First Team honors in both singles and doubles. Guillin finished the season with a 10-6 overall singles record ""î a record that likely would have been better if not for UCSB's overall dominance. The No. 53 player in the country, Guillin received an at-large bid to participate in the NCAA singles championship. In only his second season as a Gaucho, Krustev went 14-4 in dual-match play, and was ranked for a majority of the season. As a duo, Guillin and Krustev crushed their opponents, tallying an 11-2 record in dual-match play. Rounding out First Team honors for UCSB, Moreno De Alboran and senior Anders Holm earned First Team honors in doubles play for the third straight year, as well as an appearance in the NCAA Doubles Tournament. Winners of their last eight doubles matches, the duo will be the first Gauchos pair to make the postseason since Morgan Mays and Simon Freund in 2017. Senior Hironori Koyanagi was also honored on Wednesday, earning Second Team honors. Since moving up to the fourth spot, Koyanagi has cruised to a 6-1 record, including five consecutive victories. After winning 32 straight Big West matches, it is no surprise that UCSB took home so many conference accolades. Now, the Gauchos will hope their conference success translates into a deep run in the NCAA Tournament.

sports,"No. 8 Gauchos Look To Get Back On Track, Face CSUN",2-May-19,8:44 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/no-8-gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-face-csun/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Last week was a bit of a wake-up call for the No. 8 UCSB baseball team. Santa Barbara traveled to UC Riverside with a bunch of momentum, riding the high of a program-best 13 straight wins.  What met them, however, was a swift punch in the face as the Gauchos stumbled losing their first conference series of the season, dropping two of three against the Highlanders. Because of that, UCSB dropped to second in the Big West standings with a 9-2 conference mark. Following a win at home versus CSUB on Tuesday, Santa Barbara is 33-7 overall.  This week, the Gauchos will have a similar test as they travel to face CSUN, a team that has had its fair share of struggles this year currently boasting a 19-23 overall mark and a 6-9 †league record placing them in the bottom third of the standings. Last week, really everything that could go wrong, did go wrong for UCSB. In losses on Friday and Saturday, the Gauchos were outscored by a combined score of 16-6.  On Friday, starter Ben Brecht took his usual spot on the mound for the Gauchos. Coming into the game, Brecht had pitched stellar, but that night he was anything but. Brecht (7-1) suffered his first loss of the season following an outing that included allowing eight hits and seven earned runs in just four innings of work. The junior also had a season-low three strikeouts. On Saturday, the story was the same for Jack Dashwood (6-1). The lefty suffered his first loss of the season following a 4.2 inning outing that involved him allowing nine hits and five earned runs. Dashwood did strike out nine batters but gave up a season-high two home runs in the same game. The Gauchos will hope to get back on track this week facing a CSUN team that ranks seventh in the conference in batting average. The team sports just a .259 batting average.  However, when CSUN does get contact, it hits for power as its slugging percentage (.404) ranks third in the conference meaning Gaucho pitchers will need to make sure to not throw stuff right down the plate. Also, last week UCSB pitchers were facing one of the best power hitters in the Big West in Conner Cannon from UCR. This week, CSUN does not really have a ferocious hitter such as Cannon. The Matadors do have infielder Kyle Barret, however, and he certainly has had a solid campaign. He currently sports a .333 batting average and has drove in 25 runs. His 15 doubles on the season rank first in the conference. CSUN still has other solid hitters across the lineup as it has four players in the top 30 of the conference in terms of batting average, but no one that really scares the opposition. The Gauchos, however, definitely have those power hitters that scare the opposition. Even last week, UCSB still sprayed a bunch of hits, and in the one game the squad took at UCR, it exploded for 20 hits and 15 runs. Sophomore shortstop McClain O'Connor was the man of the hour last Sunday at UCR as he had the game of his life batting 4 for 6 driving in four runs and scoring three times. O'Connor is really one of the hottest bats on the team since becoming a consistent player in the lineup mid-March. In his last 14 outings, O'Connor has accumulated 20 hits and eight RBI's. His .359 batting average would rank as one of the top among the conference if he had more at-bats. Speaking of hot bats, outfielder Armani Smith has been on a tear. The junior currently holds a five-game hitting streak and in that same time span, Smith has gone 6-17 with three RBI's. His 33 RBI's rank third amongst the team while his eight home runs rank second. Recently, Smith also hit the .300 club as he sports a .302 batting average thanks to his recent hitting. Finally, Marcos Castanon made his return to the lineup last weekend and has been solid. The sophomore third baseman in his three starts has gone an outstanding 7-13 with three runs scored and one batted in. For UCSB, this week is all about getting back on track. A nice midweek win really gave this team a little more confidence, but the truth is the Gauchos are far from a league crown. Cal Poly is coming hard so Santa Barbara needs to pick up these wins when it can. UCSB will begin its three-game set versus CSUN at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 3 at the Matador Baseball Field.

sports,Party Like it's 1999: Coach Marty Davis' 20-Year Dynasty,2-May-19,12:20 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/party-like-its-1999-coach-marty-davis-20-year-dynasty/,"† UC Santa Barbara head coach Marty Davis during 2019 Big West Tennis Championships Day 4 at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Sunday, April 28, 2019 in Indian Wells, California. Photo Courtesy of Josh Barber When a UC Santa Barbara student thinks about the most popular sports team on campus, it might be obvious to think the answers would be men's basketball or men's soccer. But when that same student thinks about what the most successful team has been on this campus in the past 20 years, it might be hard to think about men's tennis.  However, men's tennis is the correct answer. In the past 20 years, the UCSB men's tennis program has won 12 Big West Tournament titles and made 12 NCAA Tournament appearances; no other UCSB program has won more tournament titles in the past decade as the men's tennis team. And the man leading this team is none other than Marty Davis.  This past Saturday, Davis made conference history, leading the UCSB men's tennis team to its fifth-straight conference title.  ""úWinning [Big West] titles never gets old. It is always a blast and always a new experience,""ù Davis said. Davis' work has not gone unnoticed. On Wednesday, Davis took home his 11th (and fourth consecutive) Big West Coach of the Year honor.  Since taking over during the 1999-2000 season, Davis has only finished worse than third in the conference once. Since 2001, he has won 12 of the last 18 regular season titles. Davis and his team currently own an insane 32-match win streak over Big West opponents. ""úWhat we have been able to do says a lot about this program but also about these players. I love coaching these guys and having Blake [Muller] on my staff certainly helps a lot,""ù Davis said. Still, what Davis has done transcends beyond the local sphere. Davis has transformed the UCSB tennis program into not just the best in the Big West conference but one of the best mid-majors in the country. Every single year, Coach Davis has his team on the cusp of the ITA national rankings and every year his team is able to come up with big wins against nationally-ranked and highly-respected tennis programs. This past year, the Gauchos defeated then No. 17 Oregon 4-3. It was the first time in Davis' career that UCSB bested a top-20 program in the country. Before this, Davis coached his team to a win over No. 22 Texas Tech in 2012. ""úI was so pumped when we won. Wins against programs like that are hard to come by but we always work so hard to take advantage of them. I always believe we are a top-25 team in the country and wins like that remind me why,""ù Davis said.  Even beyond the coaching on the court, Davis is truly a man athletes respect and admire for the time he has put into this program and into his players. But on the court, Davis' coaching is clearly special. Under Davis' guidance, numerous UCSB players have reached outstanding heights.  In 2000, Simon Shen was named Big West Player of the Year after going 20-0 in dual match singles, 30-3 overall and advancing to the NCAA Championships as an individual.  In 2002, not only did the Gauchos win their first league title under Davis, but Carlos Palencia was named Big West Player of the Year and advanced to the NCAA Tournament as well. Palencia was named Player of the Year again in 2003.  In 2017, the UCSB doubles tandem of Morgan Mays and Simon Freund qualified for the NCAA Championships. This year, Davis has coached a UCSB team that at one point had three players ranked in nationally in the ITA Top 125, the first time that has happened in the program's history. He also is largely responsible for the development of senior co-captain Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, who started the season ranked No. 6 in the country, the highest any Gaucho has ever reached in men's tennis. Last year, the New York native was close to knocking off the No. 1 player in the country in the NCAA singles championships. This year, Moreno de Alboran won his second Big West Player of the Year honors, only the sixth in league history to win the award twice, and he also earned a spot in the NCAA singles and doubles championship.  He is currently ranked No. 16 in the country after earning a 14-3 dual-match record. He has also won 12 of his last 13 matches. ""úI am so grateful for what Marty has done for me. He gave me an opportunity not many others were and he made me the player I am today,""ù Moreno de Alboran said. Moreno de Alboran will be joined by teammate Joseph Guillin at the NCAA singles championships, the first time in program history UCSB will have multiple representatives.

Photo Courtesy of Josh Barber Still, the work is not done for Davis. While he has earned 12 NCAA Tournament appearances, a win has eluded him every time. In fact, the one thing that still drives Coach Davis every year is the opportunity to help this program win its first NCAA match since 1998. Every year, however, the Gauchos get closer and closer.  Last season, UCSB nearly upset USC †in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. The 4-1 score might not indicate it was a close match, but the Gauchos at one point held first set leads on four of the six courts. ""úWe played so well last year, it was hard to be mad, but it did show that we are right there. Our goal every year is to win a round at the NCAA's, now we just have to get it done,""ù Davis said. This year, UCSB drew No. 24 Texas Tech in the first round of the tournament and Coach Davis could not be more excited to make this the year they get the win. ""úThe team is happy, I am super happy. It's always hard for us to not draw the host team in the first round and that makes a big difference,""ù Davis said. ""úThis will not be easy, but I am confident in this team and in us to get the job done.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 1 of the May 2, 2019 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,UCSB Set To Take On Texas Tech in NCAA Tourney,2-May-19,8:50 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/ucsb-set-to-take-on-texas-tech-in-ncaa-tourney/,"Nicolas Moreno de Alboran is ranked No. 6 in the country, the highest ranking of any Gaucho in program history. Photo courtesy of ITA Tennis. The UCSB men's tennis team made program history last week, earning their fifth consecutive Big West Championship title; now, they are set to face No. 24 Texas Tech in the first round of the 2019 NCAA Tournament.  The Gauchos (16-6, 5-0) made their Big West sweep look effortless. Beating Texas Tech, however, will not come with as much ease. The Red Raiders faced brutal competition over the duration of their season. Each team in the Big 12 Conference alone is nationally-ranked, including No. 4 Texas, No. 6, and No. 9 TCU. Texas Tech (15-11) earned an at-large bid into the tournament after finishing 2-3 in B12. Nonetheless, its repeated exposure to highly competitive programs""îand being one itself""îgives it an experienced advantage, one that Santa Barbara simply did not have the opportunity to develop.  UC Santa Barbara has only faced four nationally-ranked teams this season and only defeated No. 17 Oregon.  The Gauchos' success so far, however, cannot be undermined so easily. Undefeated in league and boasting a .727 winning percentage, the team has unsurprisingly demonstrated how in many ways they mirror, if not exceed, the talent of Texas Tech as doubles and as individuals.  Santa Barbara brings four nationally-ranked singles and duos into this next match: No. 16 Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, No. 58 Joseph Guillin, No. 115 Victor Krustev, and No. 89 doubles Anders Holm and Moreno de Alboran. Moreno de Alboran came into his senior season with the prospect of being one of the program's best players, and his outstanding performance so far only solidified the claim. Of his last 14 matches, he has racked 12 wins. A local at the No. 1 court, the senior has also faced 14 nationally-ranked singles and more importantly has been triumphant over eight of them.  This experience will lend itself to defeating Moreno de Alboran's likely opponent: No. 79 Parker Wynn. Though at one point he was riding on eight wins in a row, Wynn only recently broke a four-game losing streak against Baylor's No. 22 Johannes Schretter. Granted, the junior's last six competitors have consisted solely of players ranked in the top 100.  For that reason, facing Santa Barbara's co-captain may seem daunting, and rightly so, as Moreno de Alboran exceeds his and most of his recent opponents' rankings.  At court one for doubles, fellow co-captain and senior Anders Holm joins Moreno de Alboran. Seasoned and consistently dominant, the two earned their ranking as a pair by no mistake. After taking out Cal Poly's top duo on Sunday, the doubles achieved their eighth consecutive win.  The No. 89 senior pair significantly defeated the No. 17 doubles team Jacob Brumm and Yuta Kikuchi of No. 46 Cal Berkeley in a single 6-1 set.  Texas Tech's most dominant duo, however, poses a massive threat to their streak. Ranked tenth in the nation, redshirt junior Bjorn Thomson and Wynn boast an impressive 28-9 record.  Before losing their last conference match, Thomson and Wynn secured arguably their most prized victory of the season against the No. 1 doubles team in the nation, No. 6 Baylor's Sven Lah and Jimmy Bendeck.  The two were recently selected to participate in the NCAA Singles and Doubles Championship in May.  Holding down the two and three courts for the Gauchos are No. 58 Joseph Guillin and No. 115 Victor Krustev. Likely, the junior and sophomore will face No. 108 Tommy Mylnikov and Ilgiz Valiev.  As for the rest, Santa Barbara will need to successfully utilize their built-up momentum in order to take out Texas Tech and exceed the first round of NCAA. Though as a program the Red Raiders are threatening, the UCSB team has the skill on both the doubles and singles levels to carry out an important win. The Gauchos will get this opportunity this Friday at 11AM in Palo Alto.  Comments are closed.

sports,"UCSB Swept by Upstart Matadors, Drop Fifth Straight",2-May-19,8:59 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/ucsb-swept-by-upstart-matadors-drop-fifth-straight/,"Alyssa Diaz runs to first base to tag out Hawaii player. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus UCSB was unable to keep CSUN's offense at bay as the Gauchos dropped all three games at home against the Matadors last weekend.  After the conclusion of the series, the Gauchos fall deeper into the doldrums of the Big West at 2-13 in conference and 8-38 on the season. With the sweep, the Matadors improve to 8-7 in the Big West and 24-24 overall.  The most obvious takeaway from this series is that the UCSB pitching staff was unable to slow down a very good CSUN offense, leading the Gauchos into a hole that they were unable to dig themselves out of. The Matadors outscored the Gauchos 21-7 over the course of three games and never trailed over that stretch. The pressure of playing from behind combined with solid pitching performances by CSUN put UCSB at a major disadvantage for the duration of the series. Game one on Saturday was the most lopsided game of the entire series, as CSUN was able to score five runs on six hits in the top of the first inning to basically solidify the outcome from the start. Northridge's bats were cooking the whole time as they finished with 13 hits as a team and with five players producing more than one hit. On the other side, Santa Barbara only managed six hits as a team; Sammy Fabian was the only Gaucho to record more than one hit as she went 2-4. The Matadors extended their lead to 8-0 in the fifth inning before RBI's from Teah Thies and Devan Sperry brought the lead to 8-2 in favor of CSUN. The lead eventually ballooned back to 10-2 before the game ended and Northridge took a comfortable 1-0 series lead. The second game played out in a very different way than the first but with a similar outcome. No runs were scored through the first three innings as Veronika Gulvin of UCSB and Kenedee Jamerson of CSUN both seemed comfortable early on. Northridge ended up striking first, putting up one run in the fourth and fifth innings due to a single and a sacrifice play. Santa Barbara then immediately responded as a Maci Finessingle and Melanie Menor double tied up the score at 2-2. Unfortunately, the Gauchos' comeback effort fell short when CSUN put up three runs on four hits to go up 5-2 in the sixth inning and as UCSB did not record a hit for the rest of the game, ultimately falling in the second game of the back-to-back. The series finale on Sunday continued the trend of the Matadors grabbing an early lead as they found themselves up 5-0 after four innings with the Gauchos having yet to record a hit against Jillian James, the ace of CSUN's pitching staff. UCSB was finally able to retake the momentum and put some fear into CSUN for the first time all game as they racked up three runs on five hits in the bottom of the fifth, forcing a pitching change with the tying run at the plate. Still, the Gauchos were unable to come all the way back as Kenedee Jamerson came in and staved off the Gaucho comeback effort. The Matadors put up one more run in the sixth inning to extend their lead back to three, which proved to be insurmountable for Santa Barbara as they went on to win by a score of 6-3 and clinched the series sweep in the process. The Gauchos will face UC Riverside next weekend in their final home series of the season, starting with a doubleheader at Campus Diamond starting at 1 p.m. on Saturday, May 4. great thanks

sports,"Women's Water Polo Demonstrates Improvement, Finishes Third in Conference",2-May-19,9:04 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-02/womens-water-polo-demonstrates-improvement-finishes-third-in-conference/,"Attacker Shannon Moran looks for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus No. 11 ranked UCSB women's water polo team wrapped up their season this past weekend with an overall record of 22-8, 3-2 in conference play, as well as finished third place in the Big West. After having an up and down year last season where they only won 16 games, Santa Barbara was able to rack up six more wins. They were able to win the close games that they had lost the season prior behind strong leadership from their seniors. Senior utility Kate Pipkin, who made 1st team all conference, was instrumental for the ""òChos as she tallied 40 goals, 29 assists, and 18 steals. One thing that cannot be overlooked was Pipkin's ability to playmake for her teammates. This kept opposing defenses from being able to double team as UCSB would almost always make the extra pass. On that note, senior attacker Sarah Kreiser also had a season to remember as she was able to score 32 goals as well as 26 assists, earning her 2nd team all conference. Her consistency was crucial to the success of UCSB this year as she had numerous well-timed goals to either give her squad the edge or put the game out of reach for their opponent. For junior utility Sarah Snyder, next year will be her final season where she will look to build upon her impressive numbers this year. Snyder netted a team high 65 goals along with seven assists. Although she is nearly impossible to stop on the offensive side of the pool, one aspect that she will look to improve on will be her playmaking with the departure of Pipkin. There is a lot to be excited about for the gauchos as they return the majority of their starters for next year. Moreover, there will be opportunities for the younger players to take on a bigger role as well. Junior utility Caitlyn Snyder will look to take on one of those roles, following her impressive freshman season. Snyder, who is Sarah Snyder's younger sister, finished with 27 goals and 30 assists. Another highlight for the ""òChos was the play of their goalkeepers. Both sophomore Becca Buck and junior Kenzi Snyder shared time in front of the cage and combined for a total of 250 saves. The dynamic duo has grown a tremendous amount of confidence which will undoubtedly carry over to next year. UCSB will look to build upon their successful season with the hopes that they will finally win the Big West Conference. In order for them to do so, they will need to further develop their chemistry from this year. Many of their losses this season have been extremely close which is a sign that if they learn from their mistakes, they will be able to win those similar situations next season. Since the Big West Conference is extremely competitive, it will be crucial for Santa Barbara to have a strong offseason. If there is one area that UCSB will look to improve, it will be their movement when their offensive sets are not yielding results. There were times throughout the season where they would be in a drought offensively and would be unable to break out of it. By continuing to move whether that be by cutting or setting screens, this will create more opportunities for shots on goal. UCSB will look to build upon their successful season as they aim to win the Big West next season with an experienced group that is ready to take the next step. † † Comments are closed.

sports,Gauchos' Cinderella Run Cut Short By No. 12 Stanford,5-May-19,9:25 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-05/gauchos-cinderella-run-cut-short-by-no-12-stanford/,"UC Santa Barbara's Nicolas Moreno de Alboran during 2019 Big West Tennis Championships Day 4 at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Sunday, April 28, 2019 in Indian Wells, California. (Photo/Josh Barber) To conclude nothing short of a historical season, the UCSB men's tennis team was handed their final defeat by No. 12 Stanford (19-6) in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The 4-0 loss marked Santa Barbara's first in its last eight games and cemented their finish with a 17-7 overall record.  Nonetheless, their advancement into the second round alone was an accomplishment that had not been fulfilled in over 20 years. The Gauchos, therefore, were reluctant to go down without a fight.  The dominant senior duo Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm delivered an impressive 6-2 win over Stanford's Sameer Kumar and Timothy Sah on the number one court. Alongside their teammates, the co-captains finished their season boasting a 15-9 overall record.  Their time playing together is not quite over. The two, now ranked 64th in the nation, will represent Santa Barbara at the NCAA Doubles Championship in May. Singles standout No. 58 junior Joseph Guillin will also join them and compete for the singles portion.  This is the first time in program history that UCSB will be represented by more than one player in each of the respective NCAA Championships.  Guillin and doubles partner sophomore Victor Krustev fell to Stanford's sophomore-junior duo Axel Geller and William Genesen in a 6-2 match. Now split 1-1 between Stanford and Santa Barbara, the doubles point rested on the men of court three, UCSB's sophomore Joseph Rotheram and junior Alex Dominguez Soto.  The pair battled Stanford's Jack Barber and Sangeet Sridhar in an extremely tight set. Tied 3-3, Barber and Sridhar, bolstered by the cheers from their home crowd, pulled away, stealing the next three matches and the doubles point from the Gauchos.  It seems impossible to deny the momentous effect of Stanford's home court advantage. In the six singles face-offs, four were forced into the third set, but no Gauchos emerged victorious from them. Nonetheless, UC Santa Barbara fought tirelessly throughout each in an attempt to counter the previous doubles loss.  Senior Hironori Koyanagi was forced into a third set by sophomore Timothy Sah, where he ultimately dropped the match. Though it was not reflected in the outcome, Koyanagi was an integral part of the roster starting in the second half of Santa Barbara's season. †† The senior ended his last season as a Gaucho with seven straight wins, sending his dual match record up to 14-7.  Anders Holm was bested by senior Michael Genender in a two-set sweep. The loss was uncharacteristic of Holm, who in his last eight appearances had been undefeated.  Nationally ranked singles Moreno de Alboran and Guillin each left with unfinished matches. No. 16 Moreno de Alboran was called while he was leading 2-0 in the third set, while No. 58 Guilin was battling to take back his early lead in his respective third set.  Stanford senior Sameer Kumar solidified the win for his team, taking out Victor Krustev in two games. He first delivered a hefty 0-6 sweep to UCSB's sophomore on the third court. Krustev responded eagerly and forced his opponent into a tiebreaker but ultimately lost the battle.  And, albeit with more difficulty than anticipated, Stanford swept the Gauchos on their home court.  But, as aforementioned, the UCSB men's tennis team has nothing to be ashamed of. Over the course of the 2018-19 season, the team earned numerous accolades and gained immense recognition for UCSB in the eyes of both Big West and NCAA. Comments are closed.

""úI knew with a runner on second and third I had to get the ball elevated and he led with a fastball up over the plate and I stuck my bat out and [the ball] happened to out,""ù Smith said. The Gauchos are now 37-7 overall and have won six straight games. The team has also won 15 consecutive contests at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium, just two short of a tying the program record that was set back in 2016, the same year UCSB went to the College World Series for the first time.  As for the Gaels, they drop to 27-19 overall and end up splitting the two-game series with UCSB. Smith's home run was the hit the put the Gauchos in front, but overall the team was stellar from the plate again totaling 10. That marks the 23rd time this year UCSB has earned double-digit hits in a game owning a record of 20-3 in those contests.  Smith also bumped his hit streak to nine games which has also seen the junior total 10 RBI's in that stretch. Still, the first inning was a bit of trouble for the Gauchos and left-handed pitcher Jorge Arellano Jr. After getting the leadoff man to fly out, the redshirt freshman allowed two singles and walked the next two batters giving St. Mary's a 1-0 lead with the bases juiced. Arellano Jr. worked his way around the jam, striking out the next batter and forcing the last one to pop out to only go down 1-0 to start. In the bottom of the second, sophomore Andrew Martinez tied the game at 1-1 with a solo shot to left center. He would finish the day going 2-4. The tie game would not last long, however, as in the top of the third, junior Kevin Milam hit his seventh homer of the year to give SMC a one-run lead again. Milam has been on a tear for the Gaels lately as he has homered in two straight now and has gone 6-16 (.375) in his last five contests.  The sides would then trade scoreless innings until Smith's big fly in the sixth which was made possible after catcher Eric Yang was hit by a pitch and Thomas Rowan lined a double earlier in the frame.  Smith went 2-4 in this contest legging out another triple this season pushing his total to eight on the year, just one off the single-season record.  ""úThat last triple I hit, even if I was out I was going to go for it. You have to take chances and that record is in the back of my mind and it is something I want to break,""ù Smith said. Ultimately, Smith's home run really did prove to be the difference as St. Mary's pulled within one in the eighth after an RBI single from sophomore outfielder Joe Vranesh but never managed to tie or take the lead again. In fact, UCSB stretched its lead in the bottom half of the eighth out to 6-3 following a two-run single from junior Tevin Mitchell.  Junior right-handed pitcher Chris Lincoln tossed the final 1.1 innings of the game ""î impressively striking out all four batters he faced ""î to earn his 13th save of the year. The Moreno Valley, Calif. native is one save away from tying the save single-season program record. Junior righty Connor Dand picked up the win improving to 3-0 this year after coming in relief for Arellano Jr and tossing 2.1 scoreless innings. He allowed just one hit and struck out two. UCSB will begin a three-game series against LBSU at 3 p.m. Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

sports,Gauchos To Host Big West Conference Championships,10-May-19,11:55 AM,"['Leonard Paulasa', 'Estef Zuniga']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-10/gauchos-to-host-big-west-conference-championships/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus UCSB Track and Field prepares to compete in the NCAA Big West Championships this coming Saturday. The team will be following the successful weekend accomplished by seniors Hope Bender and Tyler Nelson during the multis, both of whom took first in the heptathlon and the decathlon respectively.  Bender was the favorite and successfully defended her title, winning the Big West heptathlon in back-to-back years. Meanwhile, Nelson reclaimed glory and made his return to the top after not having won the event since 2016. Nelson scored 7,420 points while Bender broke the Big West conference meet record for the heptathlon with 5,814 points. Previously, former Gaucho and U.S. Olympian Barbara Nwaba set the record in 2012 by ending the heptathlon with 5,709 points. This is the first time since 2012 that two individuals from the same school won the decathlon and heptathlon at home. Besides the multis, the Gauchos closed out a great regular season with both men's and women's teams defeating Cal Poly in the Cal Poly Dual. The men's team defeated the rival Mustangs with a score of 104-97, while the women outpaced them with a score of 104-98. The Gauchos have been consistently improving throughout the season with many members setting new personal records, or PRs, and also cementing themselves in UCSB history by breaking school records. Junior Chloe Cox placed herself 10th overall in the 3000 meter steeplechase with a time of 10:49.94, and Bender had yet another record to break placing her 5th overall in our 400m record with a time of 54.68s. ""úWinning at home was absolutely as special as I have ever imagined, and having friends and teammates there who don't usually get to watch the multi was even more amazing,""ù Bender said. ""úGetting to close out my Big West heptathlon career with a win was icing on the cake and a huge boost going into the weekend.""ù Bender's success can be attributed to her hard work and dedication throughout her running career, as well as her drive to improve that has existed since her high school days.  ""ú[My passion] started out in high school when I realized that the harder I worked, the faster I got, and that become kind of addicting,""ù Bender said. ""úI love training, and even on the long and hard days I love walking away with a sense of accomplishment and like I got better on that day. I think that's what keeps me going: little victories each and every practice  Sophomore Sam Pica also had a strong performance during the Bryan Clay invitation, placing second only behind Nelson. He translated this performance with a 5th-place finish in the multis this past weekend, but look for him to make his mark in the 4√ó400 and the long jump. Bender already holds the majority of the women's track and field records, but look for her to close out her last Big West tournament with a bang. The success the team has had throughout the season has been remarkable. The season is slowly coming to a close, but expect them to represent the school with pride and fight for the championship.

sports,"No. 7 UCSB Eyes Program Record, Hosts LBSU",10-May-19,1:13 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-10/no-7-ucsb-eyes-program-record-hosts-lbsu/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus With three weeks remaining in the 2019 season, the No. 7 UCSB baseball team is still in prime position to make some history. Nine of the Gauchos' remaining 10 games are conference contests, and the winner of the Big West title will likely come down to the last weekend which will pit UCSB against Cal Poly, teams that are tied for first in the conference with 12-3 marks. Still, Santa Barbara cannot get too ahead of itself, even if it faces a Long Beach State team this weekend that sits dead last in the standings with a 5-10 Big West record and 11-35 overall mark. Long Beach State is just two years removed from nearly reaching the College World Series before being eliminated by Big West foe Cal State Fullerton, but it is now on pace to have one of its worst seasons in decades. The program also fired nine-year coach Troy Buckley on April 11 after a reported incident of workplace violence. Buckley was 260-231-1 during his tenure. Since his firing, however, LBSU has managed to turn things around a bit. After starting the season 5-26, Long Beach State has won six of its last 15 games, including a sweep of UC Riverside ""î the only team to take two of three from the Gauchos this season ""î and nearly knocking off No. 1 UCLA this past Tuesday, losing in 12 innings 2-1. That may not seem like much, but it does highlight about how far this program has come in just the past month of play. In fact, even in those 15 contests, LBSU has tallied 130 hits which is about eight hits per game, a solid number. The team's .259 batting average as a whole might not seem great over the past 15, but it is up more than 48 points than where it was before. Overall, the team sports a .234 batting average which is dead last in the conference but, again, higher than it was before. LBSU's pitching staff has also been revived during conference play. The Dirtbags have allowed the second-least hits (121) in conference play. The staff also holds the second-best ERA (4.67). Also, despite LBSU's record, the team does put up a fight in each contest. Twelve of Long Beach State's last 15 games have been decided by two runs or fewer, with seven of those meetings being decided by just one run. The Dirtbags have gone just 1-6 in those seven one-run games and are 3-2 in matches decided by two runs over that span. If a few more things go right for them in some of these games, LBSU might be contending for a title as well. Regardless, UCSB should still roll through the Dirtbags. The Gauchos' pitching staff has combined to strike out 399 batters this season, topping the Big West. LBSU strikes out a good amount with 323 on the year. Also, Santa Barbara's offensive firepower might be too much for the Dirtbags to even think of overcoming. Right fielder Armani Smith has been on a tear lately as he currently owns a nine-game hitting streak. During that stretch, Smith has had five multiple hit games and gone an impressive 14 for 34 (.411) while also scoring seven runs. This recent stretch has also seen his batting average jump 24 points as he now sports a .319 batting average. Additionally, the Martinez, Calif. native has accumulated one fourth of his total RBIs this season in just the last nine games for a total of 10. Smith also has 10 homers on the season, second best mark on the team. Also, the Gauchos have been especially tough to beat at home, owning an impressive 22-1 record in home games this season. UCSB has won 15 consecutive games in Santa Barbara with the team's last home loss coming on Mar. 17 against Cal Baptist. If the team can sweep, UCSB will have set a new program record for most consecutive wins at home in a single season. The Gauchos last set that record in 2016 when they won 17 consecutive games. That was the same year UCSB went to its first ever College World Series. Coincidence? I guess we'll find out. First pitch between LBSU and UCSB will begin at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 10 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. Comments are closed.

sports,Slumping Gauchos Travel to SLO for Rivalry Matchup,10-May-19,12:01 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-10/slumping-gauchos-travel-to-slo-for-rivalry-matchup/,"Maci Fines slap-hits in an attempt to get on base. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus A fairly underwhelming season has left the 8-41 (2-16 in the Big West) UCSB softball team with nowhere to go but up. Coming off a sweep at the hands of UC Riverside in their final home series, the Gauchos will travel to SLO to face the Mustangs and put a stamp on another edition of the Blue-Green rivalry.  Similarly to UCSB, Cal Poly comes into the final three-game series of the season with not much to play for other than pride, as the Mustangs and Gauchos currently occupy the seventh and eighth positions in the conference standings. Cal Poly has dropped five consecutive games leading up to this weekend's series, and UCSB has dropped its last eight, which means that this series provides a great opportunity for one of these teams to finish the season on a high note. It is difficult to know what to expect from this series because both Cal Poly and UCSB rank in the bottom two in the Big West in terms of runs scored and earned run average, so it will be interesting to see if we get some low-scoring pitcher duels or high-scoring offensive showcases between these two squads.  One way the Gauchos could gain an advantage is if their star player, sophomore Sammy Fabian, can keep up her stellar hitting to supply the Gaucho offense with runs. Fabian hit a bit of a rough patch in the middle of conference play, but as the season went on, she found her rhythm again. Fabian led the Gauchos against UCR, going 5-11 in three games against the Highlanders. She has now recorded a hit in seven of the Gauchos' last eight games and raised her batting average to .390 on the season.  In addition to Fabian, senior Melanie Menor has been very reliable throughout Big West play, as she is currently batting a team best .327 in conference while also leading the team with six RBI's over that span. Menor is another Gaucho who has upped her play as of late, recording three multi-hit games out of her last five.  Pitching is one of the areas in which the Gauchos have remained consistent for most of the season. Their 4.50 overall E.R.A. as a staff for the entire season is similar to their 4.45 Big West E.R.A. However, both of these figures place last in the conference, which is a big reason why UCSB has found little success throughout the year. The good news is that Cal Poly's pitching staff has given up the second-most runs in the Big West, so the Gauchos will not be outmatched against their final opponent of the season.  The Mustangs also have no hitters with an average above .209 on the season, with junior Hailey Martin's .267 mark being the closest. Cal Poly does have four players hitting between .243 and .267, however, so there is a bit of depth that has to be accounted for by UCSB pitchers.  But the Cal Poly player that should worry UCSB the most is their ace starter, junior Steffi Best. Best has found a different gear in conference play, as her 3.70 E.R.A. ranks fourth in the Big West over that span. Her record is only 2-8 in Big West play, but she has thrown a complete game in nine of her 10 starts, so she definitely has the stamina to carry the Mustangs for an entire game. The Gauchos will look to replicate the result of last year's Blue-Green rivalry, during which they took two out of three games from the Mustangs in Santa Barbara. With no postseason implications at stake, these two rivals will be playing purely for bragging rights, which will hopefully bring out the best in both squads. The first game of the series will be played on Friday at 3 p.m. as the first of a doubleheader at Bob Janssen Field on the campus of Cal Poly SLO.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The UCSB Gaucho softball team saved their best for last as they took two out of three games against rival Cal Poly for their first series win of the season.  With this weekend's series win, the Gauchos will finish the season with a 10-42 overall record and a 4-17 record in conference play, placing them at eighth place in the Big West. Both UCSB and Cal Poly had suffered through less-than-stellar seasons up to this point and had little left to play for, but a three-game set against a rival served as the perfect opportunity for the winner to end the season on a high note.  The series began with a doubleheader on Friday, where we saw two close games won by both squads. Game one started off well for the Cal Poly, as Lily Amos's homerun in the bottom of the first got the Mustangs going, and a third inning single by Hailey Martin scored two more runs and put them up 3-0 by the end of the third.  That lead held until the fifth inning where the Gauchos came back to tie the game at three with help from an RBI single from Sammy Fabian and a fielding error from Cal Poly that plated two more runs for UCSB. Game one was coming down to the wire, †and the Gauchos were able to find clutch hits when they needed them as Devan Sperry ripped a two-out bases-clearing double in the top of the seventh to put UCSB up 6-3; they eventually ended up winning by a score of 6-5. Game two also stayed close throughout as Cal Poly again jumped out to an early 2-0 lead, thanks to a pair of RBI singles in the second inning. UCSB tied the game up in the third but could not hold on ""î the Mustangs scored two more runs in the third and another in the fifth to have a 5-2 lead heading into the seventh inning. The Gauchos threatened in the seventh, scoring one run only to line into a double play with the go-ahead run at the plate. † With each club securing a win on Friday it meant that the series and season finale on Saturday would be the final chance for UCSB to win a series against a Big West opponent this season, and to do it †against their bitter rival would make it even sweeter. The Gauchos definitely understood the significance of this game, as they came out red-hot in the first two innings. Devan Sperry started her brilliant 4-4 day with a two-RBI single in the first before Santa Barbara really blew the game wide open in the second with a four-run, five-hit inning thanks to a pair of two-RBI knocks from Sammy Fabian and Devan Sperry. Santa Barbara put up another five-hit inning in the fifth, this time bringing home three runs to push the score up to 9-0. Cal Poly put up one run in the fifth on a Gaucho fielding error, but they were unable to do any more damage as the game was called due to the mercy rule after the fifth inning. The Gaucho pitching staff was also locked in on the mound in Saturday's game, as Felisha Noriega and Veronika Gulvin combined to give up three hits and zero earned runs; the game was called after five innings. This series marks the end of the 2019 UCSB softball season and in a season that did not go as well as hoped, a series win like this against a rival is something that you can hang your hat on as we look forward to next year.

sports,Athlete Q & A: Track and Field Star Hope Bender,16-May-19,3:24 PM,['Leonard Paulasa'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/athlete-q-a-track-and-field-star-hope-bender/,"In the midst of preparing for regionals and the NCAA championships, Hope Bender took some time out of her day to provide us insight into her life and her plans for the future. Bender is a bonafide superstar in the sport of track and field, breaking and owning countless school records that rival those of Barbara Nwaba, a former UCSB student and current Olympian. Two weeks ago Bender competed in the Big West Multi Championships and retained her crown as the heptathlon champion, winning the title back-to-back. She continued her dominance last weekend during the Conference Championships and proceeded to place a new record in the long jump with a whopping distance of 6.29 meters, to go alongside her mind-boggling 400-meter hurdle time of 56.64 seconds that destroyed both the school record and conference record. Bender's performance was unlike any other, and her continued excellence in the sport earned her a second consecutive Big West Women's Athlete of the Meet honor. LP: Hi Hope! On behalf of the Nexus, thank you again for granting us an interview. Do you mind telling the readers your full name, age, year and major? HB: Not a problem! My name is Hope Bender, I'm a 22-year-old senior at UCSB and I'm a biology major. LP: How did you decide to do track, and how long have you been involved in the sport? HP: I started track my freshman year of high school, but I started taking it seriously my junior year so it's been about six years. My mom did track, which was the reason as to why I started. In high school, I started out in the 200-meter and 400 -meter sprints, but focused more on the 100-meter and 300 -meter hurdles my senior year. LP: Did it feel like it came naturally to you? HB: Events like the hurdles, running events and shot put came pretty naturally, but the jumps ""î especially the high jump ""î and the javelin I'm still trying to get the hang of. LP: Why the heptathlon? HB: I chose it because I wanted to do a bit of everything. I didn't want to focus on just one event, because I thought that might get old after a little while. I had a club coach that encouraged me to look into the heptathlon, and he taught me how to do hurdles and the other events. LP: How different is it to train for the heptathlon? HB: The amount of time it takes is the biggest difference. We spend more hours on the track because we have so many different things to focus on. We only have so much time with each of the events. We can't spend hours on a single event, so we have to spread our time out evenly. LP: Given that you only started participating in the heptathlon your freshman year at UCSB, how does it feel to become a back-to-back champion? HB: It's pretty cool! My first two years were definitely my big learning years, and just learning how to get comfortable, grow and getting a good foundation in the events. The past two years have been fun and not have to focus on just getting a mark on an event, but getting to challenge each event ""î making sure I'm competitive and getting good results across the board. Being back-to-back champ has been a ton of fun, and it means more that I got to finish out at home and that the last conference meet was here. LP: So ""¶ congratulations on being a back-to-back champ, and also congratulations on breaking even more school records this past weekend. With that in mind, what record do you want to break next and why? HB: Thank you! The next one I want is the heptathlon school record. It's currently held by Barbara Nwaba. She went to the Olympics in 2016 and finished second in the NCAA championships her senior year. She's incredible and has been a friend and a mentor to me, so I'm looking forward to giving it one more shot in the NCAAs. LP: How intense has training and nutrition gotten now that you're prepping for nationals? HB: Everything is about being strong and fast, and more about peaking. We're making sure my eating and nutrition is dialed in. Practices are shorter, but more intense. Everything is about making sure we're mentally, emotionally and physically ready for Austin. LP: What are your goals for the year, and what results would you be happy with? HB: I brought up the heptathlon school record, and I want to achieve 6,000 points in it. It's kind of a barrier that separates good from great. I would hate to put a number or place on what I'd be happy with, but just going out and not having a bad event, being consistent across the board and maybe getting a couple individual event PRs to boost my scores to where I want to be. LP: As a senior, this would be your final year as a student-athlete. Where would you want to go after your graduation? HB: Just looking forward one year, I want to compete in the 2020 Olympic trials next June, so I'm planning to give track at least one more year and give it a good run. I'll never be able to do it again, so I might as well. After that, I'd love to get my MBA and work on the business side of the biotech industry. LP: Any final words, messages or shoutouts to our readers? HB: Shoutout to Coach Horn, Coach Marlow and Coach Schmitt. Shoutout to my teammates. I was so impressed by every single one of them and how they carried themselves during the races. Everyone did better than expected. As a final message, the biggest thing I learned from track and field is that there's always going to be good times and hard times, but it's important to have people who believe in you even when you don't. That support pushed me to be who I am today. LP: Thank you again for the interview, and good luck in nationals!

sports,Youthful Gauchos Finish Eighth in Big West Conference,16-May-19,3:00 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-16/youthful-gauchos-finish-eighth-in-big-west-conference/,"Sierra Altmeyer makes contact with the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The 2019 campaign for the UCSB Gauchos softball team was laden with struggles and growing pains as the young team navigated their way through a difficult season. However, the Gauchos will only lose three players to graduation after this year and the others will return next season after learning from their experiences and improving on the field. With a 10-42 overall record and a 4-17 conference record, UCSB rounded out the bottom of the Big West, finishing just a game back of seventh place Cal Poly in the standings.  The season started off strong for the Gauchos, as they emerged victorious in three of their first four games, scoring double-digit runs in two of them. It was after this point that things took a downhill slide as they went on to lose eleven of their next twelve games, and over this stretch they only managed to plate three runs in a game once. This trend of a lack of run support from the offense continued throughout non-conference play as the Gauchos sported a record of 6-25 through their first 31 contests. Heading into conference play there was some cautious optimism that going head-to-head with their Big West foes might jumpstart the Gauchos and get them rolling again. However, the struggle continued for Santa Barbara as they only managed to grab one win in their first nine Big West matchups. Again, it was the offense that sputtered, as their only win during that time came in the form of a 3-1 win against UC Davis. The Gauchos were nipping at their first series win but they ultimately let it slip away in heartbreaking fashion against a very good Long Beach State team. After taking the first game of the three-game set, Santa Barbara dropped the next game before letting the series finale slip through their fingers as they surrendered four runs in the bottom of the seventh before ultimately losing the game by a single run. That loss proved tough to recover from as Santa Barbara suffered back-to-back sweeps at the hands of Cal State Northridge and UC Riverside before they bounced back for the highlight of their season, a series win on the road in SLO against Cal Poly. The Gauchos pulled out all the stops in order to record their first series win of the year in their rivals' backyard, winning the series-clinching game 9-1 in five innings due to the eight-run mercy rule. UCSB was lead by their undeniable star Sammy Fabian, as the super-sophomore rode her .404 season average and nine stolen bases to an All-Big West First Team selection, the second All-Conference selection of her young career.  Catcher Teah Thies also took home All-Freshman honors for her work behind the plate and team-leading 17 RBI's.  The Gauchos also got significant contributions from junior Devan Sperry, possibly the most consistent UCSB hitter on the season who finished with an outstanding batting average of .308. Senior Melanie Menor also proved to be a major contributor for the Gauchos, one who got better as the season went along. Menor's breakout was one of the best stories of the season as she was only batting .116 through 31 non-conference games before she hit her stride in conference play and batted .328 against Big West opponents.  The UCSB pitching staff was anchored by junior Felisha Noriega, who lead the team with 125.2 innings pitched, a 3.63 ERA, and 81 strikeouts.  While the record might not jump off the page the UCSB softball team has many reasons to be encouraged heading into next season. Some new emerging players coupled with the already-established players easing into their roles as upperclassmen is a recipe for improvement and the hope is that this season is just a necessary bridge to cross before this team is able to consistently compete with the best of the best.

sports,The Greatest Shooter in the Game: An Ode to Steph Curry,17-May-19,3:22 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-17/the-greatest-shooter-in-the-game-an-ode-to-steph-curry/,"Tinna Lam / Daily Nexus Chef Curry. The Baby-Faced Assassin. The Human Torch.  The Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry has earned a bunch of nicknames throughout his storied career. Already a two-time (and once unanimous) MVP, three-time champion and ""úgreatest shooter ever""ù by the age of 31, Curry's career is almost perfect. He's currently playing against his younger brother in the Western Conference Finals and is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and former Virginia Tech Volleyball player Sonya Curry; to the casual observer it must look like he was destined for greatness. If you've followed him closely throughout the years, however, you would know that that wasn't always the case. I certainly didn't think I was watching an all-time great player when I first really started following the Warriors my freshman year of high school. Up to that point, my knowledge of the Dubs mostly revolved around my older family members's memories of the Run TMC era, being snuck into Oakland bars as a kid to watch the 2007 We Believe Team and being oddly drawn to shooting guard Kelenna Azubuike because of his awesome name. I certainly remember feeling furious that Monta Ellis didn't get an All-Star bid, and venting with my stepfather when we traded him for Andrew Bogut. Still, other than my friends and I (regrettably) nicknaming Curry ""úNoodle Legs""ù because of his ankle injuries, none of the early memories of my Warriors fandom really involved him. That all changed in the 2012-13 NBA playoffs. The Warriors were a plucky six-seed that year led by second-year coach Mark Jackson and Steph Curry, who had garnered national attention earlier in the season when he scored 54 points against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Most Warriors fans at that point had conceded that trading Ellis was the right way to go, but I personally still wasn't sure how far Curry could take us. Little did I know that this would be the debut of one of the most dominant postseason players the game has ever seen. Steph was on fire in the first round against the Nuggets, torching the Denver defense for two 30-point performances sandwiched around a 29-point game, and leading the Warriors to their first playoff series victory in six years. When he then turned around and dropped 44 points in the first game of the Western Conference Semifinals on the Spurs, the whole league was put on notice and people started to understand that this guard who had been hampered by injuries could really ball. He elevated himself from a good shooter to a great player, and after losing to the Clippers in an emotionally charged first-round series in 2014, the stage was set for him to truly take his game to the next level. And that's exactly what he did. Curry did more than just change public perception during his first MVP season in 2015; he actually shifted the landscape of the entire NBA. While old heads like Charles Barkley dismissed the eventual champion Warriors as a ""újump-shooting team,""ù while an East Coast-biased media elevated teams like the Hawks or Cavs over the Dubs, while Houston fans and their team obnoxiously campaigned for James Harden to win the Most Valuable Player award ""î †Steph and the Warriors just kept on winning. They eventually faced off against the ""úGrit ""òn Grind""ù Memphis Grizzlies in the second round of the 2015 playoffs, and as Curry sunk shots from the opposing free-throw line, it was almost as if we could see the passing of the torch right in front of our eyes. The Warriors's ball movement, quick and smart defense and shot-making ability simply brushed off the outdated bully ball style of the Grizzlies, and it was all catalyzed by number 30. Steph would end up leading the Warriors to a championship, following up with the greatest offensive season in history in which he averaged 30.1 points on 50/45/90 shooting and won a unanimous MVP. Being hampered by injuries and losing in seven games to the Cavs would also bring over Kevin Durant to create the best duo to ever step on a basketball court. Two championships later, this is where we stand. Curry already has the resume of the second-best point guard of all time. He is the leader of the statistically greatest starting lineup in NBA history, ranks ninth in points per game in the playoffs and is blowing away three-point shooting records with ease. When Kevin Durant went down with an injury this year, it was Curry with 33 points in the second half of game six to bury the ""úrival""ù Houston Rockets and advance to the Western Conference Finals. The only inconsistent part of Curry's game now seems to be the criticism levied against him and his team. At first, the Warriors were unfair because they got Kevin Durant. Then the Warriors needed Kevin Durant in order to win the championship. At first, Curry isn't ""úclutch""ù because he doesn't have a finals MVP. Then when he does carry the team, he's a ""úfrontrunner""ù or ""úshowboat""ù. At first, the Warriors were a soft jump-shooting team that lucked into a finals. Then they became an illegal-screening, dirty powerhouse that bullied lesser squads into oblivion. While media talking-heads try to get their narratives together before another Warriors championship victory, Curry just continues to add to his legacy. He is the most selfless superstar the game has seen, embodies a leader in the truest sense of the word and belongs on the Mount Rushmore of NBA players. He is not just part of the greatest offense in the league, but is himself the greatest offense in the league. His gravity and the way he stretches out opposing defenses is something that has never been seen before. When his career is done, when the Warriors are back to being a middle-of-the-pack team playing in an overpriced San Francisco stadium, when their championship hopes are nothing but a memory, he will be talked about in the same way we talk about legends like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. We should be grateful that we get to see him in his prime now.

The members have been training for various lengths, ranging from the start of the quarter to the start of the school year, and boast their strength and technique in a meet filled with tough competition. Powerlifting is a sport that emphasizes strength and technique, maximizing efficiency in its three key lifts: the squat, bench press and deadlift. Recently, we were able to talk to the president of UCSB's Santa Barbara Powerlifting (SBPL) Club, Justin Holcomb, and club member Arianna Tong, to ask about their individual thoughts and emotions about the club and the sport. Daily Nexus, Leonard Paulasa: Hi guys, thank you both for doing this interview. To start, I would like to ask each of you how you got involved in powerlifting? Justin Holcomb: I was introduced to powerlifting through this club my freshman year. Arianna Tong: I started powerlifting about a year ago, actually, May 2018. I learned a bit from water polo, but I started lifting more weights when I was trying to lose weight. LP: Do either of you have any stories on how or why you started taking it seriously? JH: I wanted to join a meet in June 2016, so about eight months after I joined the team, I started training for powerlifting. AT: The weight loss journey is really when I felt a sense of empowerment and rush to return to the gym. I remember my multiple failed attempts of a deadlift, but when I finally lifted that, I felt a sense of triumph, and that's when I really fell in love with powerlifting. LP: How did you discover the powerlifting club? JH: My hallmate told me about it. AT: I became involved after Justin approached me and asked if I wanted to join. LP: Arianna, what's it like to be in a male-dominated sport and to be doing something that's socially ""úunfeminine""ù? AT: Honestly, it's still an issue that I struggle with daily. You have a personal responsibility to own your craft. Sometimes, men just don't find muscles physically attractive, or it's unnatural for a 5'3""ù girl to be squatting a lot of weight. But that's O.K. I just have to understand that not everyone is going to accept or like physical changes. Someone who I would consider a female role model is actually someone on our team ""î Avilia Lieu. I love the way she carries herself, and she's an absolute unit. She handles her success with grace and poise, and she's inspiring for women trying to get into powerlifting. LP: What do you have to say to the people that don't consider powerlifting a sport? JH: Powerlifting is a sport to the extent that it's a competitive expression of physical skills. It aims to isolate and test muscular strength, which means minimizing focus on other athletic qualities. Success in more traditional sports depends on the integration of these qualities, but that distinction doesn't make powerlifting more or less of a sport than others. LP: Do either of you have anything to say about SBPL or to the people interested in joining but are too intimidated? JH: The thought that leads to intimidation is something like, ""úI'm not strong enough to be accepted by these people.""ù Let me ask you, have you ever seen someone trying [something] new and thought, ""úWow, they're not very good, so I don't want to be friends with them""ù? No. So don't tell yourself that. I want people to know that SBPL is about building a community; bonding with other people through an individual sport is how we grow.  AT: I initially brushed off Justin, actually, and thought, ""úI'm not strong enough to lift as much weight as the people on the team.""ù But similar to what Justin said, it's really not about how much weight you can lift. SBPL is about creating an inclusive community who are passionate about the same thing we're passionate about. I met some of my closest friends here and have become a better athlete and competitor. LP: Thanks guys! Good luck on your competition this weekend, and we wish you good luck!

sports,How Community is Built at a Mid-Major School,23-May-19,2:16 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/how-community-is-built-at-a-mid-major-school/,"4,800 people were in attendance for the Gauchos victory over Cal Poly. Community and school spirit are complicated to measure on a college campus. There are schools so tight-knit that even wearing your rival team's colors at a certain time can be a social death wish, and there are schools where you can go to class in another college's sweater and people won't bat an eye. Clothing choice obviously isn't the only barometer for school spirit, but the truth remains that some colleges and their students revel in the concept of an exclusive identity and the bonds that come with it far more than others. This sense of community, of belonging, is often both reflected in and created by college sports. It's easy to see this in the powerhouse schools across the country. Alabama's football team literally brings together an entire city and surrounding areas on Saturdays to watch the game; Duke and the University of North Carolina have created metaphorical fortresses just 15 minutes away from each other with their men's basketball teams; the University of Connecticut formed a women's basketball empire that draws thousands of students to fill their arena just to watch their team on the big screen when they make it to March Madness. While how much of this is just young people wanting to fit in and get drunk on the weekends while watching the game and how much is a genuine feeling of community and school spirit (and just how different these two things are) is up for debate, there's no doubt that these effects of sports on a college campus are very real. So how does this play out at a football-less mid-major school here at UCSB?  To understand this relationship between sports and how we form community as Gauchos now, we first have to look at how we did it in the past. While the NCAA and college sports did not exist as both the financial and social institutions they are now in the early days of UCSB, our sports teams certainly did have a presence. Even as far as 70 years ago, the Nov. 16, 1945 edition of the Daily Nexus (then known as El Gaucho) recapped our men's basketball team's 36-25 victory over the Marines by pointing out how our ""úcapacity crowd""ù helped will the Gauchos to victory. Forty five years later, our basketball stadium earned its ""úThunderdome""ù moniker because of how raucous the crowds were in our victory over the highly esteemed University of Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels. Students literally camped outside the ""òDome the night before to wait in line for tickets, and footage from the inside on game day showed a crowd that almost makes the Cameron Crazies pale in comparison.  This still holds true in the recent past. From 2000-2015, we hosted seven out of the top 10 highest attended regular season soccer games in NCAA history, won the NCAA College Cup and also hosted the UNC basketball team here at the Thunderdome.  Over all these years UCSB built up a strong reputation nationwide as a ""úparty school,""ù even without a football team for most of it. Students were able to mix the relative freedom and separation that Isla Vista offers with school spirit and community that is centered around our sports teams. That was not the UCSB I came to in the Fall 2016, however. Injuries, fatigue and just a lack of enthusiasm seemed to plague most of the sports teams my freshman year.  Our men's basketball squad finished 6-22 and had some of the lowest attendance numbers in years; our men's soccer team finished 10-7-3 and lost in their first match in the Big West tournament; our baseball team fresh off a remarkable College World Series run went 24-32 and weren't even close to sniffing the postseason and although our women's basketball team had a surprisingly good postseason run, they ultimately dropped the Big West Tournament championship game and ended with a 16-16 record. It really did feel like a fragmented campus in many ways. While people were able to find community on campus in other ways, whether it be through clubs, fraternities or just their dormmates, there was never really a time or place that I felt connected to the student body as a whole †other than our school-sanctioned concerts and one Blue-Green rivalry soccer game against Cal Poly. It only took one year, and a historic basketball season, for that to change. When our men's basketball team started off the 2017-18 season with a 9-2 record led by new Head Coach Joe Pasternack and star junior guard Max Heidegger, students began to get curious. It was my first year covering the team and when I interviewed Coach Pasternack in the preseason, he emphasized over and over again the importance of getting the campus involved with the team for the benefit of the students and the players. I thought he was being overly optimistic at the least and that perhaps spending so much time as a coach at the University of Arizona had skewed his perception, that it wasn't really possible to bring people together here in the way he claimed.  Then students started to show up to the games. Slowly but surely attendance started rising, and our team became the talk of the town. I heard conversations about UCSB basketball in the dining commons, in class, even in random places I.V. It seemed as if people were just waiting for something to cheer for, for something or someone to rally around, for a way to express their pride in being a Gaucho. We ended up having the best home record and home crowd in the Big West, culminating with a packed house of 4,833 students in our season finale beatdown of Cal Poly. I remember looking up and seeing the packed stands that night, seeing everyone in blue and gold cheering on the team and thinking that this is what community feels like. Now, just a year later, we have the opportunity to make our own mark on UCSB sports history. Our men's volleyball team reached as high as a No. 3 rank this season and packed Roberson Gym with eager fans during the games; our men's basketball team again had an incredible season and actually saw attendance numbers rise; both tennis teams have been running through their competitions; our women's water polo team was nationally ranked and our baseball team has put together the best season in program history. This sports renaissance has not just been great for sportswriters and stat-geeks like me but has also given incoming and continuing students a chance to go cheer our teams on and be a part of their success as well. While UCSB might never be a sports powerhouse, while we might never get a football team or have tailgating opportunities, we've shown that we have the ability to find a sense of community in the teams we do have, and as long as our teams keep improving, so will our school spirit.
Print abandoning football was an idiotic move. UCSB pays for that year after year. last I checked students get in free. The paying ""úcommunity""ù is Santa Barbara County and its environs. Men's and women's basketball engaged the community at times over the past 40 years(Pimm/French) but filling that tiny pre-fab events center is not exactly coining it. The former football stadium has far more potential but that went the way of the dodo. Oh, and substituting soccer?""ìno way.

sports,No. 4 UCSB Closes Out Season Hosting Blue-Green Rival Cal Poly,23-May-19,2:06 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/no-4-ucsb-closes-out-season-hosting-blue-green-rival-cal-poly/," Holding a three-game lead with three games to play, the No. 4 UCSB baseball team is in prime position to claim its first Big West title since 1986. The Gauchos are in complete control of their own destiny heading into the final weekend of the regular season versus their Blue-Green rival, Cal Poly. Even with three losses this weekend, Santa Barbara has already clinched at least a share of the Big West title. But that is not enough for these Gauchos who want to win the championship outright. Winning the title outright would open a world of possibilities for UCSB. It would be the Gauchos's third championship in program history and with at least a series victory, they might have enough of an impressive r√©sum√© to host a regional, their first time doing so since 2015 and second in team history. Additionally, if UCSB was to sweep, the team would surpass the current record and set a new one for most wins in a single season, which is currently at 46. Santa Barbara comes into this matchup 44-7 overall and 18-3 in league play. Cal Poly travels to UCSB holding a 26-27 overall mark and 15-6 conference record, though the Mustangs may have more than they bargained for as they hope to pick up three wins in Santa Barbara. This season, UCSB holds an outstanding 26-1 record at home and have dominated at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium under Andrew Checketts, earning a 169-68-3 overall mark at home in the past eight seasons. Furthermore, Santa Barbara has won 19 straight ball games at home, a program record that continues to grow with each game. With 44 wins in 51 games, it is not just one player doing everything right ""î it is the team playing at an excellent level. Junior catcher Eric Yang has been great all year and was recently named as one of 14 semifinalists for the Buster Posey National Collegiate Catcher of the Year award. He is currently batting .389, which is the best mark on the team, to go along with seven homers and 45 RBIs. Another great player as of late is junior outfielder Armani Smith who is currently working an outstanding 16-game hitting streak. In that same time span, he has gone 27 for 69 (.391) and 14 runs batted in. Pitching wise, sophomore Jack Dashwood will take the mound on Friday following a phenomenal start last weekend, striking out eight in seven innings and allowing just one run on two hits. For the season, Dashwood is 9-1 and sports a 2.16 ERA. Overall, this weekend is huge for UCSB. The team is aiming for new program records and bragging rights during this slate. Santa Barbara has only dropped one weekend series this season. Something tells me the Gauchos are not too keen on dropping a second one against their Blue-Green rival. First pitch between UCSB and Cal Poly begins at 3 p.m. on Thursday, May 23 at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

sports,UCSB Impresses at Singles and Doubles Championships,23-May-19,2:27 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-23/ucsb-impresses-at-singles-and-doubles-championships/,"UC Santa Barbara's Nicolas Moreno de Alboran during 2019 Big West Tennis Championships Day 4 at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Sunday, April 28, 2019 in Indian Wells, California. (Photo/Josh Barber) Though the UCSB men's tennis team's overall season has been over since the first week of May, the accolades and program-firsts have yet to stop rolling in. Beginning this past Monday, three of UCSB's best men's tennis players traveled across the country to the Sunshine State to compete in the NCAA singles and doubles championships.  No. 56 junior Joseph Guillin and No. 16 senior Nicolas Moreno de Alboran represented the Gauchos in the singles portion, and Moreno de Alboran paired up with senior co-captain Anders Holm to compete in doubles.  On Tuesday, Moreno de Alboran and Holm pulled off a massive upset, knocking off Ohio State's No. 13 seniors Martin Joyce and Hunter Tubert. This victory made them the first duo in program history ever to advance in the doubles competition.  The duo delivered an impressive three-set performance ""î 6-3, 5-7, [10-8] ""î sandwiching their opponents with wins in both the first and third sets. Unfortunately, the pairing's run in the tournament came to a halt on Wednesday. In the round of 16, Tennessee's senior Timo Stodder and redshirt senior Preston Touliatos ""î ranked sixth in the nation ""î handed Holm and Moreno de Alboran only their second loss in their past 12 matches. After losing the first set 6-1, the duo displayed their resilience, battling back to take the second set 6-4. Ultimately, however, the pairing's season ended after they dropped the tiebreaker set 10-5. As for the singles championships, junior Joseph Guillin, ranked 56th in the nation, defeated his most competitive opponent, No. 43 sophomore Gabriel Decamps from UCF, in the first round of the singles championships.  Closely ranked and both at-large bids, the two battled an arduous three sets. Decamps took an immediate lead, winning the first set 4-1. Guillin, however, switched the momentum to his side and physically outcompeted his opponent. Forcing a tiebreaker in the second and watching Decamps go down with a cramp in the third, he clinched two more crucial wins ""î 3-6, 7-6, 2-0 (retired) ""î to secure the overall victory.  Snagging this three-set win in the first round of singles moved Guillin into the second round and put him in the running to be named an All-American alongside teammate Nicolas Moreno de Alboran.  But on Tuesday, Mississippi State's No. 61 junior Giovanni Ordini capped Guillin's 2018-19 season with a 3-6, 1-6 defeat.  Despite the loss and consequently the claim to an All-American title, the Parisian impressively became just the sixth Gaucho in program history to advance into the second round of the NCAA singles championships. He closes his season with a cleanly-split overall record at 24-12 with seven notable wins against nationally ranked opponents.  Surprisingly, Moreno de Alboran's run was abruptly ended in the first round. The senior steadily secured the first set, but a hefty loss in the second required a crucial battle to snatch the third. From there, it took great composure for Texas A&M's No. 58 sophomore Hady Habib to ultimately take out the number one Gaucho 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (5). Concluding his singles season now with a 28-9 overall record, Moreno de Alboran finishes at the top of the 2018-19 Gaucho roster. His impact on the team and the program overall seems undeniable, and as a result of his outstanding year, the New York native will go down in Gaucho history as an All-American. †† Although Guillin, Moreno de Alboran and Holm are all eliminated now, 2019 proved to be another great year for UCSB men's tennis. With Guillin returning next season for his senior year, look for the Gauchos to come back stronger than ever next season. Comments are closed.

sports,UCSB Celebrates First Big West Title Since 1986 Following 7-0 Win,25-May-19,7:42 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-25/ucsb-celebrates-first-big-west-title-since-1986-following-7-0-win/,"This is the third conference title in program history. Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus The No. 4 UCSB baseball team struggled the majority of the final weekend of the regular season, but with its back against the wall and the Big West title on the line Saturday afternoon, the Gauchos responded with a huge 7-0 win over rival Cal Poly to claim their first league title since 1986.  This is the third conference title in program history. ""úWe have been chasing this for a while. It means a lot. We have had some big moments but we never had a Big West championship so this means a lot,""ù Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. Santa Barbara finishes the regular season 45-9 overall and a Big West best of 19-5 in conference.  The team won 14 of its last 16 ball games and put itself in a position to host its second-ever NCAA regional tournament. With a win on Saturday, the Mustangs would have clinched a share of the league crown and would have received an automatic bid to the NCAA regionals. Instead, Cal Poly concludes its season 28-28 overall and 17-7 in Big West play. Despite it being senior day for the Gauchos, it was the young freshman on the mound who really solidified this win for them. Left-handed pitcher Rodney Boone pitched an amazing game Saturday. In possibly the biggest game of his career, the freshman tossed 8.1 innings, striking out a career-high 12 batters and allowing just five hits and three walks.  At the plate, UCSB tallied a solid 10 hits to score seven runs. In the previous two games of the series, Santa Barbara had just eight hits and three runs. The run support for Boone came early; in the bottom of the first inning, the Gauchos were able to get two across the plate, thanks to an RBI single from sophomore infielder Andrew Martinez and an RBI groundout from junior right fielder Armani Smith.  In the third, two more were runs scored for UCSB due to RBI singles from Smith and junior center fielder Tommy Jew. Jew was one of the six Santa Barbara athletes to be celebrated on Senior Day.  ""úWe were hoping to chill today and relax with our families but we had to come in ready and locked in. To be able to celebrate with everyone is special,""ù Jew said.  The other honorees include right-handed pitchers Alex Patterson, Liam Steigerwald, Kevin Chandler, left fielder Michael McAdoo and left fielder Tevin Mitchell.  As for Jew, the junior went two for four on the day to finish the regular season batting .282 with 39 RBI's.  Two more runs came across in the fourth, following a triple from shortstop McClain O'Connor which brought in both a run and a sacrifice fly from Martinez to bring in O'Connor. Finally, in the seventh, Mitchell blasted his fifth home run of the year to left field, giving his team a commanding 7-0 lead. Mitchell was a standout player for UCSB all year hitting his career-high five home runs and tying the team lead in stolen bases at 20. As dominant as Boone was, it appeared that Checketts would let him finish the outing off. Instead, the plan was to let him get one final out before bringing in closer Chris Lincoln to finish off the score. After striking out the leadoff batter, Boone got the call and left the field to a standing ovation for his performance. ""úIt was an awesome moment and an amazing feeling,""ù Boone said. Lincoln came in needing just two outs to finish off the Mustangs. He struck out the first batter then got the final one to ground to third. Third baseman Jason Willow picked up the ball, spun around and launched it to Kyle Johnson at first who secured the catch for the final out of the ball game. The team was all smiles after the ball game, with many players hugging each other and the championship trophy.  ""úI can't explain it. This is probably the happiest I have been in years. I love each and every one of these guys and I just could not be happier,""ù senior Thomas Rowan said.  Rowan was honored last year on Senior day which is why he did not participate in the activities today. For the past eight seasons, Checketts has accomplished a considerable amount since becoming the head coach of the program. He led the program to many bests including most wins in a single season at the Division 1 level with 45 wins this year and even its first-ever College World Series in 2016.  But getting the program's first Big West title in 30-plus years is very special and a testament to how far this team has come. Now, UCSB moves onto bigger things. ""úWe struggled with our identities the past few years but this year we found it. If you're going to come at us, you better give us your best because we are a resilient team and we don't care who we play in the regionals. We just want to show what we got,""ù Jew said. UCSB will find out whether or not they host a regional on Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. The team will then find out its bracket at 9 a.m. Monday morning. 
Print And now the NCAA is chose not to allow UCSB to host""ìin Las Vegas""ìgo figure.  Note that the other three schools in this region all have adequate facilities.  There will be the usual story about how UCSB's field is substandard""ìsome high schools have better facilities. The team went to the College World Series in 2016 and three years later UCSB still cannot provide a venue capable of hosting an NCAA Baseball Regional. Oh but wait they put some lights in""ìwoo hoo.  Pathetic.  The coach is going to leave if the administration cannot step up and who can blame him.

sports,"After Subpar 2018, Yang Leads Gauchos to Postseason",30-May-19,10:29 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/after-subpar-2018-yang-leads-gauchos-to-postseason/," Catcher Eric Yang had never struggled like this. It was April 2018, and the then-sophomore had just gone hittless in his two at-bats against UC Irvine, with Head Coach Andrew Checketts pulling Yang in the bottom of the seventh. In total, Yang hit .222 during the Irvine series ""î a remarkably low number for someone who hit .432 in high school. That would be the last series he started during the 2018 season. ""úI had never really had a rough patch like that before,""ù Yang said. ""úWhen I lost the job at the end of the season, it hurt, but it was good for me. It showed I can't take anything for granted.""ù In total, Yang finished the 2018 season with a .244 average and ""î more importantly ""î a chip on his shoulder heading into the offseason. Yang's belief in his own abilities never faltered; before this season, he stated that one of his goals was to be nominated for the Buster Posey award ""î given to the top catcher in college baseball. To an outsider, the thought of a recently-benched catcher becoming one of the top catchers in the nation would have seemed absurd. But Yang worked at it, tinkering with his swing in the offseason. One day, senior and fellow catcher Thomas Rowan suggested that Yang use his legs more during his swing. Desperate to find anything that worked, Yang gave it a go. The next day, Yang hit two home runs during the team's scrimmage. On top of messing with his mechanics, Yang also changed his approach at the plate, inspired in large part by new hitting coach Donegal Fergus.  ""úOur offensive style is a lot more aggressive this year than it was in the past,""ù Yang said. ""úIn years past, the staff just wanted us to put the balls in play and not strike out. This year, they want us to hit it in the air and hit home runs. They want us to hit it as hard as we can and not get cheated.""ù This change in approach has completely altered the way Yang hits the ball. Last year, Yang grounded out 33 times, with only 39 flyouts. This year, however, he has grounded out 35 times while flying out 62 times. ""úA ground ball does nothing for me, because I'm not fast, so I might as well have my misses in the air,""ù Yang said. This significant uptick in fly balls also directly correlates to an increase in power for Yang. After not hitting a single home run last year, Yang has gone deep seven times this season while contributing 45 RBIs. Even when he isn't going yard, Yang has an uncanny knack for finding the gap, with the backstop tied for the team lead with 16 doubles. Most impressively, Yang's increase in power hasn't coincided with a decrease in average, with the catcher hitting an eye-popping .383 out of the three-hole for the Gauchos. Yang's contributions to UCSB's historic season go far beyond just his bat however. This year, Checketts has allowed Yang to start calling games behind the plate, and the junior has rewarded that trust by helping create one of the strongest pitching staffs in the country. ""úI'm really close to all of the pitchers, and I even live with [Chris] Lincoln and [Jack] Dashwood, and I think we really bring that chemistry to the mound,""ù Yang said. ""úBecause our pitching staff is so reliable, it allows me to focus more on hitting [instead of] babysitting the pitchers.""ù Defensively, Yang has always been above average; this year the catcher sports a sparkling .995 fielding percentage, as well as an impressive 34.5 †caught stealing percentage. Despite his numbers, Yang still believes he has room for improvement on the defensive end. ""úI've always been able to throw, so that [caught stealing] number is honestly lower than I'd like it to be,""ù Yang said. Of course, it is this drive to be the very best that makes Yang one of the best catchers in the entire country ""î something that his recent accolades reflect. Last week, Yang accomplished his preseason goal when he was selected as a semifinalist for the Buster Posey award, alongside 13 other catchers. ""úEveryone on that list is a great player, so it was super cool to see my name on there as well,""ù Yang said.  Just yesterday, as if Yang's season wasn't already impressive enough, the veteran backstop was named the 2019 Big West Field Player of the Year, becoming the first Gaucho to win the award since Cameron Newell in 2015. From getting benched halfway through the season to being named the best field player in the conference, perhaps no player in college baseball has improved as much as Yang.  Behind Yang's resurgent bat, calming presence and consistent defense, UCSB looks poised to make a deep postseason run. And if Yang can keep up this pace, that run could end in a national title. †

sports,"Behind the Scenes, Ortiz Thrives as Undergraduate Analytics Manager",30-May-19,10:44 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/behind-the-scenes-ortiz-thrives-as-undergraduate-analytics-manager/," Freshman Rodney Boone pitched the game of his life on Saturday. Toeing the rubber for the Gauchos in the most important game of the entire season ""î the game that would decide the conference ""î Boone made Cal Poly's hitters look foolish all night long. In total, Boone threw eight and one-third innings of shutout baseball, along with a career-high 12 strikeouts. The key ingredient to Boone's success on Saturday was his changeup, with Boone generating 18 swings and misses on his secondary pitch. ""úCoach talked to me about throwing my changeup to look like a fastball and to keep my arm speed good on my off-speed,""ù Boone told KCSB's Max Kelton after the game, when asked about the effectiveness of the pitch. How did a freshman pitcher ""î one who merely throws for average velocity ""î pitch the game that clinched the Gauchos their first conference title in 33 years? Part of the answer lies with a slim, self-described nerd by the name of Tony Ortiz.  Instead of enjoying the title with the team on Saturday, Ortiz was perched high up in the bleachers, recording every single pitch and swing during the game ""î just as he's done all season. Despite only being a third-year, Ortiz has flourished this year as the Undergraduate Analytics Manager for the UCSB baseball team. Since 2017 ""î when former Director of Analytics Evan Short took over the position ""î UCSB has become the most analytically driven baseball program on the West Coast. Short pushed the coaching staff to raise the money to ensure that Santa Barbara has state-of-the-art equipment, including tools like TrackMan and Rapsodo that major league teams use for their statistics. This past year, however, Short received an offer to help build the Toronto Blue Jays' analytics department ""î an offer too good to turn down. After two years of revolutionizing Santa Barbara's analytics usage, Short left for Major League Baseball, leaving a gaping hole for the baseball program to fill. Enter Ortiz. When Ortiz first joined the baseball staff last year, he was a baseball operations intern, helping out with whatever he could around the office. But when Short knew he was leaving, he began to groom Ortiz to take over his role with the team. ""úAt first, I was only occasionally working with [Short], and it was more on the baseball side of things because I didn't have the experience with statistics or programming,""ù Ortiz said. ""úTowards the end, however, I was writing reports to provide to the coaches so they had more information about what the players needed to work on during the season.""ù With a team of four interns at his disposal, Ortiz's main job is to be the liaison between the hard data and the coaching staff, turning the code written by his interns into easily interpretable and digestible bites for the coaches to understand. ""úSometimes my interns will come up with a report, and it will still be marked with the code they wrote,""ù Ortiz said. ""úI love seeing how they did it, but when it comes to giving it to the coaching staff, I tell them we need to get rid of all of that and just get to the point.""ù Somehow, Ortiz manages to juggle his responsibilities as Undergraduate Analytics Manager with being a full-time statistics student at UCSB. In a typical day, Ortiz will go to the baseball office to upload and analyze videos, go to class and then head to the stadium to record statistics for the live bullpen sessions. ""úThe interns have been extremely helpful in my adjustment to this position,""ù Ortiz said. ""úIt's really nice to be able to rely on them for help, because it gives me more time to do the actual analysis.""ù Despite his packed schedule, Ortiz thrives because of his unmitigated love for the sport of baseball. Before I could even ask †my first question prior to the game on Saturday, Ortiz unpacked the Gauchos' devastating loss on Friday to me, explaining how UCSB's high-risk, high reward-style offense ultimately backfired. While he uses some data in his analysis, Ortiz makes it clear that his love for baseball stretches beyond just a trendline or chart. ""úI think all the time that if I could play, I would give up all the analytic stuff to play just because I love the game that much,""ù Ortiz said. With his passion and his drive, Ortiz has seamlessly filled in for Short, supplying data and analysis to the coaching staff whenever he can. Perhaps most importantly, the coaching staff has directly utilized the analysis Ortiz and his team provide.  In a more traditional game like baseball, some pundits and coaches are apprehensive to turn the game over to hard data and numbers. But under the direction of Head Coach Andrew Checketts, UCSB has wholeheartedly embraced the data revolution in baseball. ""úCoach Checketts and the coaching staff are very reasonable, and if they see something with evidence, they are going to take it and run with it,""ù Ortiz said. ""úThe coaches have their own ideas of what the players should work on, and then they can use the analytics as support.""ù Of course, a data analytics team is nothing if the players themselves don't buy in and aren't willing to learn from data rather than relying on raw intuition. Perhaps no player has embraced data as much as Boone has in his first year at Santa Barbara. ""úBoone is a perfect example of a player where you can't see how good he is until you look at his analytics numbers,""ù Ortiz said. ""úHe's not a flamethrower, but he has a wrinkle on his fastball ""î a little movement ""î that makes it harder to hit than just a regular fastball.""ù Boone came into Santa Barbara without a plus fastball, but the analytics team broke down videos in the offseason to try to help the coaches develop his secondary pitches, including his changeup ""î the very changeup that played a vital role in Boone's start on Saturday. Despite being completely behind-the-scenes, those video breakdowns ended up helping UCSB take home the Big West title for the first time in 33 years. One of Ortiz's main goals for next season is to incorporate more video and advanced statistics into the offensive side of things for the Gauchos. After putting most of his time and resources into helping the pitching staff, however, the results speak for themselves. As a team, UCSB has pitched to a 3.21 ERA this season while racking up 491 strikeouts as a pitching staff, four strikeouts away from breaking the school's single season record, which will likely be broken during the playoffs. ""úWe've really built a culture here where the pitching staff has completely bought in on the analytics,""ù Ortiz said. ""úLike the Astros and Rays [in the pros], it's just become a mindset with our team.""ù He may never get the credit he deserves, but Ortiz has played an integral role in the Gauchos' 45-9 season ""î the best record in program history.   If the Gauchos can make it to Omaha, Ortiz will be ready, boxplot in one hand, Rapsodo in the other, to help the coaching staff bring a title back to Santa Barbara. Comments are closed.

sports,NBA Finals Preview: Curry's Legacy and the Bench Matchup,30-May-19,5:16 AM,"['Leonard Paulasa', 'Annika Pearson']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-currys-legacy-and-the-bench-matchup/,"Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus Game 1 of the NBA Finals premiers tonight and will feature the Golden State Warriors versus the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors have home court advantage, and Kevin Durant will not be available for Game 1 and likely won't be available in Game 2. With Durant gone, the Warriors are looking at two-time MVP Stephen Curry to lead them on their quest for the three-peat. Both fans and media personalities questioned whether or not the Warriors would even make the Finals, believing that they had lost the series against the Houston Rockets the moment Durant went down with his injury. Nevertheless, the Warriors relied on their star point guard who would drop 33 points, all in the second half of Game 6, to put away the Rockets and advance to the Conference Finals. Yet, even after Curry's Game 6 performance, many doubted he could lead the Warriors past the scorching Portland Trailblazers who upset both the media favorite Oklahoma City Thunder and second seed Denver Nuggets. NBA Hall of Famer and TNT Analyst Charles Barkley predicted that the Trailblazers would make the Finals, and even went as far to say ""úthe Warriors have no chance of winning without Kevin Durant.""ù Curry's legacy has been in question since Durant joined the Warriors, which caused his scoring to take a minor drop. As such, analysts and fans believed that Curry's time as the greatest point guard in the NBA has gone, having been surpassed by Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, to name a few. To silence his naysayers, Curry played monstrously in the Conference Finals averaging 36.5 points per game along with 8.3 rebounds and 7.3 assists in a 4-0 series rout of the Blazers to reach the NBA Finals. The Warriors will be in the Finals for the fifth straight time being only the second team to do so, since the Boston Celtics, led by Bill Russell, did back in the ""ò60s. Curry has played the previous four, but has never won an NBA Finals MVP. While Curry has mentioned that he prefers to win the championship over the award, it's precisely his lack of a Finals MVP that people question his legacy. With Durant out for the first game and possibly the second (or longer), it's up to Steph Curry to once again carry the load and remind the rest of the NBA why he was the first to ever be awarded MVP unanimously. This is Curry's opportunity to showcase his offensive arsenal and prove to the world that the Warriors are still his team. Curry has a chance to once and for all shut up his critics, and claim the award that's rightfully his. Between Leonard, Lowry, Curry and Thompson, the NBA Finals has more than enough all-stars to keep an eye on this Thursday. Besides these players and the rest of the Raptors' and Warriors' starting lineups, however, is a bench full of players equally crucial to securing a championship ring. Traditionally, the Toronto Raptors have been known for having a deep bench and relying heavily on rotations. But, as we know, this year is not like the rest for the Canadian franchise. As showcased in the Eastern conference finals, Coach Nick Nurse has stuck to a steady eight-man rotation, which includes Fred VanVleet, Serge Ibaka and Norman Powell. Most outstandingly, the trio's combined 48 points during Game 4 against the Bucks attests to their newfound place in the Raptors' lineup. Powell and VanVleet make up the first- and second-highest marks in three-point shooters off the bench in the playoffs. Since the birth of his second child prior to Game Four, VanVleet's performance has improved greatly. Coincidence or not, his average three-point percentage over Games 4, 5 and 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals stands at 85.9% ""î† significantly higher than it's been all season ""î going 3-3, 7-9 and 4-5, respectively. His recent success may even open up a spot for him as starting point guard in the upcoming finals. Serge Ibaka's defensive game has been consistent for the Raptors come postseason. With his steady inside coverage, mobility and acute eye for rebounds, the 6'10""ù center can be very useful going against a strong offensive team like the Warriors. Norman Powell's minutes and shooting percentage from the field have nearly doubled since the conference semifinals back in the beginning of the month. Powell will enter the NBA Finals this Thursday on a hot streak after marking a lofty 74 points during the Eastern Conference Finals ""î a tremendous improvement to the mere 21 points he tallied in the semifinals. As for Golden State, their bench remains a bit more unpredictable. After a calf injury took out Kevin Durant back against the Rockets, the Warriors have had to lean on their bench more than anticipated this postseason. Now giving more starting time to players like Kevon Looney, Coach Steve Kerr relies more heavily on bench rotations; consequently, Alfonzo McKinnie, Jonas Jerebko and Shaun Livingston have been spending more time on the court. In the conference finals against Portland, McKinnie really stepped up his game. Though inconsistent throughout the majority of regular and postseason, McKinnie's shot has gradually become more reliable, scoring 12 points in Game 4 versus Portland ""î the most he's racked since nearly October. The star of the Warriors second unit so far however has been center Kevon Looney. Looney has been a stabilizing force on both sides of the ball, gobbling up rebounds and finishing at the rim like an elite big man. His matchup with Marc Gasol will be pivotal, and if he continues to play with the intensity he had last year the Warriors will be in good position to win. It may be, though, that ultimately the Raptors have the edge when it comes to their bench. Equipped with three key players who have demonstrated their ability to compete and change games at the very least threatens the defending champs.

sports,NBA Finals Preview: The X-Factors,30-May-19,12:58 PM,"['Richard Benites', 'Jesse Morrison']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-the-x-factors/,"Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus † With the 2019 NBA Finals commencing this week, there's plenty to be excited about as several captivating storylines are set to unfold. Although the Toronto Raptors' underdog narrative is proving to be an exciting one, there may be much more on the line for the reigning champions, the Golden State Warriors, as they'll be searching for that finals three-peat. Accomplishing this will be no easy task, but the following X-Factors just might be the deciding catalyst that'll put the Warriors over the top. Draymond Green We all know that Golden State's Splash Brothers duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson will be electric on offense come tip-off time. However, as the old sports adage goes, it's defense that wins championships and one Warriors player especially stands out in this field. Draymond Green's legacy doesn't only end at three-time NBA Champion, three-time NBA All-Defensive First Team and the 2017 NBA Defensive Player of the Year ""î but it does give you a good idea of his elite repertoire. Green is known around the league for his fiery passion and explosive play on the court, especially as of late when considering his recent string of performances in this year's playoffs. Notably so, he'll be entering the Finals series in fine form as he's coming off a spectacular Western Conference Championship performance against the Portland Trailblazers, where he tallied 16.5 points per game, almost nine assists and 12 rebounds. This ability to show that he can produce on both ends of the court makes Green a significant X-Factor that the Toronto Raptors must take into account. Not to mention, he may have a good shot at Finals MVP ""î that is, if the next X-Factor doesn't suit up in time for this series. †††† Kevin Durant As the current all-around best player in the league, Kevin Durant is someone who needs very little introduction. Still, his status for the NBA Finals may be in question as he's been dealing with an apparent hamstring injury that's kept him sidelined since the second-round series against the Houston Rockets; Golden State has already confirmed he will not be ready in time for game one in Toronto. At first, the media expected Durant's injury to be much worse than it turned out to be, with diagnoses like an ACL tear being projected. However, recent reports have brought concern down to merely a hamstring injury which offers him a chance to return to action for the Warriors very soon. But this only begs the question of if his return may in fact hinder Golden State's chances considering the team is 31-1 in their last 32 games with Curry and without Durant. Still, Durant's presence should without a doubt bolster his side's attack and offer another set of clutch hands if a win is on the line in the late-game. † Regardless, these X-Factors' potential storylines will make this 2019 NBA Finals one of the most highly anticipated championships in recent memory and will surely give basketball fans everywhere a spectacular show. The Toronto Raptors just made the NBA Finals for the first time in their franchise's history. This is fantastic for Raptor fans; however, they are going to have to beat the Golden State Warriors, the team competing in their fifth straight finals. Does Toronto have any chance of dethroning this star-studded superteam? Obviously guys like Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry will have crucial roles in the outcome of this series, but for the Raptors, who else is going to step up to stop the Warriors? This best of seven will most likely come down to a few key players taking their game to that next level, on the NBA's biggest stage.  The first potential X-Factor of this series is Kyle Lowry. The 12th year veteran out of Villanova took a lot of scrutiny early in these playoffs for his Game 1 performance versus the Orlando Magic. Since that game, he has been playing extremely efficient, averaging 14.7 points per game and with a 45% shooting percentage. Along with his scoring, Lowry has been facilitating the Raptors' offense, averaging 6.4 assists per contest. Coming into this Finals, Lowry will face his toughest challenge yet, defending Steph Curry. Although the Warriors can score in a variety of ways, their offense is at its best when Curry is playing well. If Lowry can pester and harass Curry to force him out of the groove, then the Raptors could have a legitimate chance. † Toronto's next potential game changer in this series, is Fred VanVleet. Since the birth of his second child on May 20, VanVleet has been shooting the lights out. In the 15 playoff games prior to his sons arrival, VanVleet was not turning heads, only averaging four points per game and hitting just 19.5% of three-point attempts. Since May 20, VanVleet has broken out, now averaging 16 points per game and has nailed 82.4% of three-point attempts. If Fred VanVleet can continue this hot shooting streak, the Raptors' chances improve dramatically in this series.  Another key component to Toronto's success is found within Pascal Siakam. Having to most likely matchup with Warriors forward, Kevin Durant, Siakam is going to have to be extremely active on the defensive end of the floor. Luckily for him, Siakam is 6'9'', with a 7'3'' wingspan and moves like a guard. Hopefully he can put all of his length and quickness to work when trying to contain Kevin Durant. In these playoffs, Siakam has been scoring very profficently, averaging 18.7 points per game on 45% shooting. The Raptors will need Siakam to continue to produce for them on both ends of the floor if they want any shot at winning.  Some athletes often think that seasons are won or lost based off of certain players within the team. This isn't the case in the NBA Finals. Championship series are never won by one single player. Every year, the NBA Finals is won by the best team. With that, if the Toronto Raptors want any chance of hoisting the Larry O'Brien Trophy, it is going to take an overall collective effort. The starters all the way to the last guy on the bench are going to have to step up to put a stop to the Warriors' reign.

sports,NBA Finals Preview: Warriors Offense Vs. Raptors Defense,30-May-19,5:00 AM,"['Kunal Mehta', 'Jake Ciccone']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/nba-finals-preview-warriors-offense-vs-raptors-defense/,"Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus To put it simply, the Golden State Warriors have been very unlucky when it comes to injuries during the playoffs. Both Kevin Durant, known as KD, and DeMarcus Cousins, known as Boogie, went down with a calf strain and a torn left quadricep, respectively, while Andre Iguodala has been dealing with a calf injury as well. When Durant in particular went down with his injury in game five of the second round of the playoffs, hope was at an all-time low amongst the Golden State Warriors fans when it came to the prospect of winning their third-straight championship. Fast forward two weeks, the narrative has now shifted to ""úThe Warriors don't need KD.""ù How have the Warriors been able to win without their big guns? There are a couple players that have kept them on the right track. Stephen Curry. After KD's injury, Curry has averaged 36 points, seven assists and eight rebounds per game. More impressively, he is shooting 47% from the field, including 41% from behind the three point line. One of the reasons why Steph has been able to play at this high of a level is because he is constantly moving without the ball. As soon as he crosses half court, he swings the ball to one side and immediately goes to the other. Once on the other side, he comes off of a couple screens, similar to how a running back follows his blockers. This has made it difficult for opposing teams to guard Curry, as their primary defender at the beginning of the play is never the one that is guarding him one-on-one toward the end of the shot clock. Usually, it is a power forward or center that is forced to switch onto him, giving Curry a tremendous advantage. The second player, who has had arguably the most impact on the team during this run, is Draymond Green. Green is averaging 15 points, eight assists and 11 rebounds in his last five games. More importantly, he has been the anchor on the defensive end of the floor, whether that be drawing charges or contesting shots. Golden State is starting to revert back to their fast-paced style, which led to a 73-9 record in the regular season just two years ago, prior to the arrival of KD and Boogie. It is clear that their confidence is growing and that the older members are trying to prove that they can still win despite the injuries the team has suffered. If †Durant and Cousins do end up returning at some point in the NBA finals, it will be important for Head Coach Steve Kerr to continue to push this fast paced offense. This style of play allows players such as Klay Thompson to be not only more involved in the game plan, but also remain engaged throughout the game. While it is a luxury to have isolation scorers such as KD, it should not change the strategy that has been working recently. The Warriors are harder to guard now because every player on the floor is either moving without the ball or setting screens for their teammates. It will be interesting to watch whether the Warriors play a different style if their star players return in time during the finals. That being said, Curry and Draymond will look to send a message to the league that their squad is more than capable of winning the finals regardless. The Toronto Raptors have fallen behind in each series they've played so far during these playoffs and have been forced to dig deep into their bag in order to successfully pull each one out (maybe the Orlando series wasn't that tough, but you get what I'm saying). Whether they were tasked with disrupting Joel Embiid or Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nick Nurse's squad has adjusted well and relied on their defense to lead them to victory. The Raptors are led offensively by the future Hall-of-Famer Kawhi Leonard, but at points throughout the playoffs some of their main scorers and playmakers have shown their inexperience (Pascal Siakam) or shown that they are Kyle Lowry (Kyle Lowry). Marc Gasol is also no longer the dominant offensive presence that he once was, and guys like Danny Green and Fred VanVleet are not the kind of multifaceted threats that can consistently make a difference in the playoffs. It is in times like these that Nurse's squad must rely on their lengthy and disciplined defense to propel them to win. The defensive dominance of the Raptors' playoff run can easily be characterized by their opponents' shooting percentages, as they have allowed the second lowest field goal percentage (41.7%) and the third-lowest three-point percentage (31.3%) out of all the playoff teams. Interestingly however, they have allowed the fourth-highest percentage of three-point shots to be taken against them (40.5%). These stats put together show that Toronto is exceptional at forcing teams out of shots near the hoop and making them take bad, highly contested shots from behind the arc. This is a strategy that worked wonders for them against Milwaukee, as their length bothered Antetokounmpo on his drives and forced him to† kick the ball out to shooters at the three-point line, who were then forced to shoot under duress as the Raptors' length also allowed them to recover and contest those shots. Toronto's exceptional defense has only improved in the playoffs, as their 102.8 defensive rating through 18 postseason games is sizeably better than their 107.1 regular season defensive rating. This is most likely due to the fact that Nurse has cut down his rotation to only his most productive players, and also because Leonard is now playing every game, which he did not do throughout the regular season. The Raptors have been known for having a strong bench with a deep rotation of quality players, but throughout this season and aided by the Marc Gasol trade, it has been the starting lineup that has set the tone on the defensive end. In fact, the starting lineup of Leonard, Gasol, Green, Lowry and Pascal Siakam has a playoff defensive rating of 99.7 over 314 minutes played. This is the only five-man unit of the playoffs to have a defensive rating under 100 and have over 200 minutes played. Since this unit has been on the floor for over 300 minutes, it has allowed the Raptors to achieve sustained dominance over the course of several grueling playoff series. Defense will be key against one of the best offensive teams ever ""î Golden State ""î and with KD likely missing time early in the series, the Raps might have the personnel to slow down the Splash Brothers and make this series interesting.

sports,No. 2 Seeded UCSB Set for Stanford Regional,30-May-19,12:05 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-30/no-2-seeded-ucsb-set-for-stanford-regional/,"This is the third conference title in program history. Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus With 45 wins and its first Big West title since 1986, the UCSB baseball team is one of the hottest teams heading into the NCAA Tournament this weekend. The team will be taking on Fresno State in the first round of the double-elimination Regionals. 2016 was the last time Santa Barbara made it to the NCAA Tournament. That year, UCSB went to its first-ever College World Series. This is the fourth NCAA Tournament appearance in seven years for the Gauchos (2013, 2015, 2016, 2019), the most in any seven-year stretch in program history, and the 12th appearance all-time. Santa Barbara's 45-9 mark this season was not enough to host a regional, but still enough to clinch a No. 2 seed in the Stanford Regional. Their opponent, the third-seeded Bulldogs, finished the season 38-14-1 overall.  Other opponents the Gauchos could face this weekend include the hosting team, No. 11 Stanford, who earned a 41-11 overall mark and fourth-seeded Sacramento State who concluded the year 39-23 overall. Despite being a hot squad, UCSB is still coming off a tough-series loss against Cal Poly. The Gauchos won the final game of the three-contest set to clinch the Big West title, but the two losses are probably what cost them a chance to host the regional. Regardless, UCSB is now looking ahead to its first opponent, Fresno State, a team it is pretty familiar with. The two teams met last season with each taking a win in their respective home game. The Gauchos and the Bulldogs have also met twice in postseason play with both victories going to Fresno State. Overall, UCSB leads the all-time series against Fresno State, 38-30.  The Bulldogs will come into this contest hot, winning seven straight and nine of their final 10 games of the season which included a win in the Mountain West Championship Game. Fresno State is led by a powerful pitching staff which includes the Mountain West's Pitcher of the year, Ryan Jensen. The junior righty led the NCAA in wins with 11 and had an outstanding 2.82 ERA with 99 strikeouts. He will be starting on Friday. The other dangerous Bulldog pitcher is junior Davis Moore. The righty tossed 83 innings on the year earning 83 strikeouts and a 4.12 ERA.  Both pitchers helped pace a team ERA of 3.72 and helped the team give up just an average of 4.2 runs per game. That staff will be tested, however, going up against the Gauchos' offense. UCSB led the Big West in batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, runs scored, hits, doubles, triples, home runs and stolen bases. Santa Barbara's offense is led by junior catcher Eric Yang who was most recently named the Field Big West Player of the Year. Yang slashed an outstanding .383/.492/.567 and recorded 25 multiple-hit games this season. The catcher finished fourth on the team with 45 RBI and fifth on the team with seven home runs. Yang was one of a program-record 13 UCSB players to earn 13 All-Big West selections. Head Coach Andrew Checketts earned his first career Big West Coach of the Year after a successful campaign while right-handed pitcher Rodney Boone clinched Freshman Pitcher of the Year honors. Other notable winners include junior outfielders Tommy Jew and Armani Smith, who earned All-Big West First Team honors. Jew was second on the team in home runs with 11 while Smith batted .325 on the year after successfully getting a hit in 17 of his last 19 ball games. Overall, UCSB has proven a lot this season but the truth is this team has some high expectations. The 2016 College World Series team was a bit of a surprise but this Gaucho team really feels like a squad capable of winning the big one. The last time any UCSB program won a national title was in 2006. The baseball team's quest to become the next begins this weekend. UCSB faces off against Fresno State at 7 p.m. on Friday, May 31 at Sunken Diamond located at Stanford University. The game can be streamed on ESPN3.com.

sports,NBA Finals Preview: Kawhi Leonard's Journey,31-May-19,8:52 AM,['Nithesh Perumal'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-05-31/nba-finals-preview-kawhi-leonards-journey/,"Sam Rankin / Daily Nexus Ten months can seem like a long time. But for Toronto Raptors' superstar Kawhi Leonard, the past 10 months have been some of the most agonizing any NBA player has faced in the modern era. Forget 10 months; 10 days is all it took for the beloved San Antonio forward to have a fall from grace previously unseen in not just the NBA but the sports world altogether.  The decorated superstar had come into the 2016-17 season as a top candidate to win the MVP race. The face of the franchise, Tim Duncan, had announced his retirement the summer leading up to the season, thrusting Leonard into the forefront of Spurs basketball ""î †an organization synonymous with class and poise.  The season culminated with a Western Conference matchup against the Golden State Warriors, after dominating the Grizzlies and the Rockets 4-2 each. The fateful Game 1 in Oracle haunts Spurs fans to this very day. With a commanding 23-point lead in the third quarter, Leonard went up for a shot to add to his 26 points ""î only to have Warriors center Zaza Pachulia make a dirty closeout leading to Leonard leaving the game. The 23-point lead the Spurs had built up to this point disintegrated and the Spurs would go on to get swept 4-0, with Leonard unable to play the rest of the series. Initially, the plan was for Leonard to make his return after the preseason. However, his debut in the 2017-18 season was repeatedly pushed back until Dec. 12. He went on to play nine games that entire season, citing continued pain in his quadricep as preventing his return.  Now, here's where everything takes a turn. Leonard was diagnosed with a quadriceps tendinopathy by the Spurs' medicalstaff. Tendinopathy is essentially a catch-all term for any issue with a tendon from soreness to a tear to a degenerative disease. Leonard had been cleared for play repeatedly throughout the season by the Spurs' medical team. However, due to lingering pain, he elected to get a second opinion and was then diagnosed with a quadriceps contusion, which is internal bleeding of the muscle susceptible to calcification. Leonards refusal to play despite being cleared by the team's medical staff in favor of a second outside opinion caused tensions to arise within the organization.  Coaches and players started putting pressure on Leonard through the media, and the basketball world sided with them. At the time, very little to almost no information was known to the public. It is still unknown what the final diagnosis on the injury is to this day. In light of the lack of information, the media and fans sided with the Spurs, which had been a model of how a top-class organization should be run from top to bottom for almost 30 years until this point.  Leonard was vilified and ridiculed by the basketball world. Prominent media members like Skip Bayless accused Leonard of crumbling under the expectations of filling Tim Duncan's shoes, while others began to question his character as a person altogether. A very clear divide had formed ""î one where it was Leonard versus the world.  Unable to rebuild trust with the Spurs organization and fans, Leonard requested a trade. Leonard had two years under contract left and had expressed explicit interest in going to LA to continue to grow his brand and career. Knowing this, very few teams were willing to part with assets that matched the talents of a player as decorated as Leonard. I mean, a two-time defensive player of the year and Finals MVP doesn't just come every draft ""î they're once-in-a-generation type players, but only getting such a player for one guaranteed year turned many teams away from making a deal with the Spurs. Toronto Raptors General Manager (GM) Masai Ujiri is not your regular GM however and despite knowing all that he knew, he took a wild gamble. The Raptors had lost to LeBron for four straight years, even though they built their team to match up specifically against the Cavaliers. After yet another upsetting elimination at the hands of James, Ujiri pulled the trigger to trade their franchise star DeMar DeRozan and roleplayer Jakob Poeltl for Leonard and Danny Green.  Toronto was ridiculed for taking such a gamble ""î giving up a young All-Star in return for a superstar who had played nine games the prior season due to injury and was set on moving to LA in the near future. Nonetheless Ujiri made the controversial move, which has paid off greatly this season. The Raptors effectively locked down the second seed, not just in the East but the NBA as a whole behind Milwaukee. After making quick work of the Orlando Magic in 5, the Raptors faced the 76ers who were widely thought to have the best starting five after the Wariors. This series went to Game 7, and with the game on the line, Leonard ripped the hearts out of every Philly fan by hitting a series-ending game winner over Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.  Toronto found themselves matched up with the best team in the NBA: the Bucks. After going down 0-2, Toronto rallied behind Leonard †to pull out a win in double overtime. Toronto went on to win four straight after losing the first two games to get to where they are today.  Leonard has come a long way from his initial fall from grace, and now stands on the verge of carrying the torch of best player in the world in the post-LeBron era to come in a few years. Now, he is less than seven games away from redefining not just his career but the NBA balance of power as a whole with the crucial 2019 free agency looming. But for now, NBA fans are all anticipating the redo of the matchup stolen from us by that injury two years ago. † Comments are closed.

sports,Awful 1st Inning Dooms UCSB in NCAA Regional Opener,1-Jun-19,11:28 AM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-01/awful-1st-inning-dooms-ucsb-in-ncaa-regional-opener/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus A five-run first inning proceeded by a two-run second frame by third-seeded Fresno State proved to doom the second-seeded UCSB baseball team who was unable to overcome the deficit, eventually falling 9-2. With the loss, the Gauchos, now 45-10 overall, fall into the elimination bracket and will face fourth-seeded Sacramento State. UCSB's road to a Super Regional also becomes vastly harder as it needs to win the next four games to advance. Fresno State, now 39-14-1 overall, will take on top-seeded Stanford who thrashed Sac State on Friday, 11-0. Normal Friday starter Ben Brecht took the mound for Santa Barbara, but the usually sharp southpaw was off his game. Brecht began the evening giving up four straight singles. After working the first out, an error by third baseman Marcus Castonon put one more run on the board for Fresno State. Brecht than worked another out. Up 2-0 with two outs and the bases loaded, if Brecht could have survived the inning it could have been a different game. Instead, first baseman Zach Presno drove in two runs with a single to left field. The ""òDogs would add one more run to have a commanding 5-0 lead through one. Things did not get much better in the second as back-to-back doubles from junior catcher Bins Carter and redshirt sophomore JT Arruda would add two runs giving Fresno State a 7-0 lead. Following Arruda's RBI double, Brecht was relieved. He ended the day allowing eight hits and seven earned runs in just 1.1 innings of work. Junior Shea Barry came in and got the final two outs to stop the bleeding. While Brecht struggled on the Gaucho side, Fresno State's ace pitcher Ryan Jensen tossed a great game. The junior, who is projected to be drafted within the first two rounds in next weeks' Major League Draft, was working a no-hitter through 5.2 innings. Jensen received another insurance run in the fourth which put Fresno State on top, 4-0. In the bottom of the seventh, UCSB was finally able to tack a run off of Jensen. The Gauchos led off the inning with a single, followed by a double to put both runners in scoring position. A sacrifice fly from junior center fielder Tommy Jew brought across a run to make it 8-1. Moments later, an RBI single from freshman infielder Christian Kirtley made the score 8-2. Fresno State countered with one run in the top of the eighth to still hold a very secure 9-2 lead. Jensen would continue pitching into the eighth inning before being relieved with two outs in the frame. He finished allowing just two earned runs and four hits with eight strikeouts. Redshirt junior right-hander Ryan Sullivan threw the final 1.1 innings allowing one hit and one walk and securing Fresno State's big opening win. Overall, Fresno State was outstanding on both sides of the field. The Bulldogs tallied 14 hits, the most the Gauchos have given up since Mar. 30 at Cal State Fullerton. On the flip side, UCSB mustered only five hits and committed three errors, the most committed in a single game since April 6 against Stephen F. Austin. All in all, Friday's result ""î and game in general ""î was disappointing for the Gauchos. This is a team that came in with just nine losses, and all none of those was by more than five runs. That being said, the beauty of double elimination is UCSB is still alive. Taking on Sac State should be easier for Santa Barbara. As a team, the Hornets bat just .235 and with Jack Dashwood taking the mound for the Gauchos the possibility of falling behind so early is not as high. UCSB takes on Sac State at 1 p.mn. on Saturday at Klein Filed in Sunken Diamond. The loser of the game is eliminated from the postseason.

sports,Santa Barbara Claims League Record 10th Commissioner's Cup,1-Jun-19,12:12 PM,['Jorge Mercado'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-01/santa-barbara-claims-league-record-10th-commissioners-cup/,"UCSB Baseball's Big West title was a driving force in the Gauchos claiming the Commissioner's Cup. Jorge Mercado / Daily Nexus UC Santa Barbara added to its record of owning the most Commissioner's Cups in Big West history after winning its tenth title for the 2018-19 school year, the league announced on Tuesday. Only three current Big West schools have ever won the Commissioner's Cup, with Long Beach State second to UCSB for most titles at eight.  The Big West Commissioner's Cup began for the 1998-99 season and it is awarded to the institution with the highest average point total following the conclusion of all 18 conference sports. Not all schools sponsor all 18 sports. For UCSB, this is the program's first title since 2015-16 and just the third since the 2009-10 year. Santa Barbara was able to take home the Cup following an outstanding season in its spring sports. The Gauchos won both Big West titles in women's and men's tennis while also clinching the baseball title. Additionally, UCSB also had top-three showings in women's water polo and women's track & field.  The final quarter was a strong finish to a pretty solid year that saw the program also claim top three finishes in men's cross country, women's soccer, men's soccer and men's basketball. Overall, Santa Barbara averaged 120.6 points over the 16 competitive sports sponsored by the campus.  In determining a champion for the cup, round robin sports and conference championship sports are split into two.  For round robin sports, points are awarded based on the final standings of the regular season with the top team getting a 20-point bonus. Big West round robin sports include baseball, basketball, soccer, softball, women's tennis and indoor volleyball. For conference championship sports, points are awarded based on the finish at the tournament. These sports include cross country, golf, men's tennis, track & field, women's beach volleyball and women's water polo. In the case of any ties in all sports, points are awarded by combining points and splitting them equally among the tied teams.  Finishing behind the Gauchos was defending champion Cal State Fullerton. The Titans won their first Commissioner's Cup in program history last season after big first-place finishes in sports such as men's basketball and baseball. This year, CSUF averaged 118.6 points after the conclusion of its 14 sports. Titles in men's golf, softball and women's track and field in the spring nearly helped the Titans lap the Gauchos ""î but they still came up just short. Rounding out the top three was UC Irvine who paced a 106.3 point average, thanks to winning the Big West title in men's basketball while Long Beach State finished fourth and UC Davis finished fifth.  Cal Poly was sixth, Hawai'i was seventh, CSUN was eighth and UC Riverside finished in last place.

 When the final day of the regular season arrived for the UCSB baseball team, everything was on the line ""î the chance to host a regional game for only the second time in program history and, more importantly, the chance to win its first Big West title in 33 years. In the Gauchos' way was their bitter Blue-Green rival, the Cal Poly Mustangs. The Mustangs had taken the first two games of the three-contest set and were hoping to steal the third at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium to stake a share of the league title and earn its way into the NCAA Tournament. With it being senior day for UCSB, it would have been fitting for a senior to step up and be the hero. Instead, it was a young freshman who made all the difference. Left-handed freshman pitcher Rodney Boone pitched an amazing game that day. In possibly the biggest game of his career, the freshman tossed 8.1 innings, striking out a career-high 12 batters and allowing just five hits and three walks.  The Gauchos supported their young arm at the plate as they tallied 10 hits and scored seven runs.  By the end of the seventh, the Gauchos had a commanding 7-0 lead. Boone continued pitching into the ninth. After getting the first out of the inning, the freshman took his exit to an excited crowd that gave him a standing ovation. Star junior closer Chris Lincoln came in and delivered the final two outs for Santa Barbara to secure the program's first league title since 1986 and just third overall. It was truly an amazing moment after the final out of the day. Players rushed the mound and celebrated for nearly an hour afterward with fans and family alike.  The Gauchos may not have done as much damage in the postseason as they wanted, but there is no doubt this was a successful season capped off by the best moment of the year. Comments are closed.

sports,Quite the Introduction: Ryan Wilcox and Caitlyn Snyder Named Freshman of the Year,8-Jun-19,10:49 AM,"['Richard Benites', 'Nithesh Perumal']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-08/quite-the-introduction-ryan-wilcox-and-caitlyn-snyder-named-freshman-of-the-year/,"† †  Although the season may have not finished quite as planned for the men's volleyball team, the Gauchos still played their hearts out and gave us an NCAA top five finish to celebrate. In addition, many bright spots were featured along the way as this talented young roster showed us that the program will be in safe hands for years to come. Particularly, UCSB was able to achieve what they did thanks in part by their freshman outside hitter Ryan Wilcox. Hailing from Honolulu, Hawaii, Wilcox's journey to Santa Barbara began during his high school career at Punahou ""î where he was named two-time Hawaii State Player of the Year and helped bring his team several Hawaii State Championships. Wilcox started his rookie year for UCSB in the team's first competitive game of the season where they took on Harvard at home. This non-exhibition matchup resulted in a five-set thriller, which favored the Gauchos by a 3-2 result; Wilcox only played in two sets for his competitive debut but still managed a statline of third-most kills on his team with eight on the day, foreshadowing his productive potential and what was to come. As the regular season progressed, so would his production. Ultimately, Wilcox's impact started to be reflected in his playtime as he'd eventually become a regular starter for the squad. But his spectacular performances weren't limited to just the regular season; Wilcox arguably played his best volleyball when it mattered most during UCSB's postseason campaign. Playing a crucial role in the Big West Conference quarterfinal against CSUN, Wilcox would go on to achieve a man-of-the-match worthy statline with a team-high 12 kills to his name ""î leading the Gauchos to another nail-biter of a victory at 3-2. Altogether, Wilcox's final overall stats place him as UCSB's second-highest in kills, with a total of 254; keep in mind, this was only his first season with the program. Not to mention, his 13 assists also lead all non-setters ""î perhaps a future at that position? Not really though. We'll take the Gaucho outside hitter, Ryan Wilcox, 10 times out of 10, which is why he's the Daily Nexus' choice for Freshman of the Year. Collegiate athletics are on a whole different level than high school ""ì with competition that is bigger, faster, stronger, and smarter. Collegiate athletics takes the top 2% of up and coming high school competitors and pits them against each other with extremely high stakes. As† expected in this demanding environment very few players make and immediate contribution to a winning team. Caitlyn Snyder has been a far cry from this prototypical freshmen athlete many come to expect. Throughout the season the Freshman Utility has consistently found a way to make her team better every time she in the water. Playing in every game this season, Snyder has been one of the biggest driving factors in the dominant success the ""òChos have had this season. Going 22-8 is no easy feat even for the most experienced veteran teams ""ì yet this team powered by their young core headed by Caitlyn Snyder has been able to find a large amount of success. Posting an impressive 30 goals and 33 assists, Caitlyn Snyder is the third highest offensive contributor on her team only slightly behind Upperclassmen Utilities Kate Pipkin and Sarah Snyder. What makes Caitlyn's game so impressive is her ability to do a little bit of everything on the court. Her ability to not only score the ball but also set up her teammates serves as an invaluable resource to this Gaucho team who have struggled on the offensive side. On top of her offensive contribution, Snyder posted 19 steals this season showcasing her ability to dictate the flow of the game on both sides of the game. Snyder has also shown an affinity for the spotlight, and always plays up to the moment. Caitlyn posted a hat trick against Cal State Northridge to close any chance of a CSN comeback, which paid off heavily in seeding. In the Big West Quarter Finals her balanced attack with 2 goals and 2 assists helped pick apart an LBSU team that was unable to scheme against her phenomenal performance. Despite how bright the lights shine, Snyder always manages to let her game shine brighter. Snyder has developed into such an imposing player that teams found themselves having to go out of their way to mitigate her impact on the game. The presence that she commands in the water frees the rest of the team to play at an elite level. It is well within reason to conclude that the team is at their best when Snyder is at her best. Over the course of this season Caitlyn Snyder has shown she is ready for what collegiate athletics will throw at her. Time and time again Snyder has been counted on as an integral piece in the Gaucho machine that rolled through the Big West to a third place finish. With her elite level play and a year for the team to develop their chemistry expect the ""òChos to be playing for that number one spot. Her consistent production on the court despite playing elite competition and her all around game which emphasizes her impact on every game subsequently gains her a much deserved spot on the Big West All Freshman Team. † † Comments are closed.

During the offseason, Yang changed both his swing and approach at the plate, eager to bounce back from a subpar 2018 season in which he hit 0.244 with zero home runs. This year, Yang paced the team with an eye-popping .368 batting average, as well as a 0.479 on-base percentage. By getting on at such a high clip, Yang was able to consistently kick-start an offense that averaged more than seven runs per game. Perhaps more impressively, Yang's increase in average also coincided with an increase in power, with the veteran backstop hitting seven home runs and chipping in 45 RBI. As a catcher, Yang displayed his ever-impressive defense throughout the season en-route to a sparkling 0.995 fielding percentage. Few runners dared to run on Yang's arm, and those who did were thrown out 34.5%of the time ""î a solid number for a collegiate catcher. Behind Yang's resurgent play, the UCSB baseball team finished the year with a 45-11 record, winning the Big West for the first time in 33 years. Yang has already won numerous accolades for his on-field success this season. Earlier this month, Yang was named the 2019 Big West Field Player of the Year, becoming the first Gaucho to win the award since Cameron Newell in 2015. And just this week, Yang was named as one of three finalists for the Buster Posey award, which is given to the top catcher in college baseball. To top it all off, Yang was selected on Tuesday by the Cincinnati Reds in the seventh round of the MLB draft. With elite offensive production and tantalizing defensive tools, don't be surprised if Yang eventually makes his way to a major league roster. Hope Bender competes in the 100 meter hurdles with Tori Usgaard coming in right behind her. Christina DeMarzo / Daily Nexus The Gauchos have posted excellent results during the 2019 track and field season, and UCSB star athlete senior Hope Bender contributed plenty to UCSB's success, and the Nexus recognizes Bender as one of our Athletes of the Year. During the season, Bender eternalized herself in the history of Gaucho athletics by breaking, and/or adding onto, eight UCSB track and field records. Bender now has a total of 10 track and field records, holding first in three categories: the 100m hurdles, 400m hurdles and long jump, with the last two bring set this season. But Bender didn't just break the records she absolutely demolished them. To put into perspective, alumni Amanda Rodriguez set the UCSB record in 2013 in the 400m hurdles with a time of 58.58. Bender broke that record by almost two seconds with a time of 56.64. Her long jump of 6.29m is also 0.13m longer than the former record holder, Kiely Gode. Bender is also right behind alumni and current Olympian Barbara Nwaba in the heptathlon with only 46 points separating their school records. Bender has one last shot to break Nwaba's record this week, as her outstanding performance in the heptathlon throughout the season garnered her a chance to compete in the NCAA Outdoor Championships, hosted by the University of Texas, which is currently underway and set to conclude on Saturday. Bender also hopes to shine brighter, as her performance in the long jump during NCAA West Regionals two weeks ago was also enough to qualify for the Championships. Bender's performance has been consistently above excellent this entire season, earning a multitude of Big West Athlete of the Week awards and earning her second consecutive Big West Conference Field Athlete of the Year Award. She has consistently improved since her freshman year, and her hard work and determination shows, as she continues her dominance in her final year as a student-athlete. Bender pushes her abilities to their limits, knowing exactly what she's capable of and always seeking to break through plateaus. Additionally, while Bender's stardom rises, she remains humble and continues to seek guidance and support from her coaches and teammates. It is due to her humble personality, exceptional performance, legendary work ethic and incredible drive to be the greatest that she's recognized by the Nexus as an Athlete of the Year.

sports,Teams of the Year: Men's Tennis Continues Dominance While Women's Water Polo Comes to Life,8-Jun-19,10:24 AM,"['Annika Pearson', 'Kunal Mehta']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-08/teams-of-the-year-mens-tennis-continues-dominance-while-womens-water-polo-comes-to-life/,"UC Santa Barbara head coach Marty Davis during 2019 Big West Tennis Championships Day 4 at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Sunday, April 28, 2019 in Indian Wells, California. (Photo/Josh Barber) From a distance, the UCSB athletic department may give an underwhelming impression; the men's tennis team gives off anything but.  This year especially, our tennis program remains perhaps the most consistently successful sports program on campus. With a roster stacked with nationally-ranked players and an All-American, the team gloriously finished their 2018-19 season with a 17-7 overall record and few historic moments under their belts.  The squad took home their fifth consecutive Big West title after sweeping notorious rival Cal Poly in the finals and going undefeated in conference play altogether. Coach Marty Davis earned his fourth consecutive ""î and 11th in his 20 years of coaching ""î Big West Coach of the Year title.  Advancing into the NCAA Regionals played at Stanford, the guys defied odds and took out No. 24 Texas Tech 4-1 having only previously faced four nationally-ranked teams (and beating only one). The program had not made it to the second round of regionals in over 20 years.  The team was ultimately bested by No. 12 Stanford, but due to the individual performances of three Gauchos, the Santa Barbara name continued to spread among the NCAA.  For the first time in program history, UCSB sent Nicolas Moreno de Alboran, Joseph Guillin and Anders Holm to the NCAA singles and doubles championships. Here, Guillin became just the sixth Gaucho ever to advance to the second round for singles, and the senior duo became the first ever to win a round in doubles. Moreno de Alboran came out of his fourth and final season as an All-American ""î the third Gaucho in history to do so. Santa Barbara's success can perhaps be traced back to the holistic strength exuded by its roster; simply, it seems they have no weak links. Statistically across singles and doubles, the team kept all but three of their averages above .500, their conference stats even exceeding the .800 mark. While Moreno de Alboran and Holm led the pack on the No. 1 court, the rest followed suit, contributing greatly to their all-around domination. Players such as senior Hironori Koyanagi for example, a local on court four, upped his game during conference play, bringing in wins for six out of his last eight games. And now, to top off this season of accolades and success, the 2018-19 men's tennis team can add one more title to their legacy ""î best team at UCSB. Attacker Shannon Moran looks for a pass. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's water polo team has been nominated as the Daily Nexus's team of the year after an impressive six-game improvement. They finished with an overall record of 22-8 including 3-2 in conference play.  One of the major reasons behind their improvement was the play of junior utility Sarah Snyder, who led the way for the ""òChos with 66 goals and eight assists. The combination of both Snyder and senior utility Kate Pipkin made it very difficult for opposing teams to stop the Gauchos' offense.  Snyder has been the team's most consistent player offensively for two seasons now, but was able to take her game to the next level this past year. While she has always been a gifted scorer, she was able to develop her playmaking ability this year. More often than not, opposing teams would decide to double team her which would force her into committing turnovers. That being said, this year she was able to find her open teammates for easy shots on goal.  It was clear midway through the season that the squad had very impressive chemistry. Specifically during power plays, Santa Barbara was able to communicate effectively despite being down a player. A year ago, this team would have given up goals in this type of situation. By fully buying into Coach Serela Kay's system, UCSB was able to improve in almost every statistical measure.  Another major difference was that the Gauchos had learned from their mistakes in the season prior. They were no longer making the same mental errors that cost them the game in close matchups. Veteran leadership from Pipkin and senior attacker Sarah Kreiser was the key difference as they kept the team focused and composed even when things were not going their way. 

Santa Barbara also made major strides defensively behind solid play from both junior goalkeeper Kenzi Snyder and sophomore goalkeeper Becca Buck. They were both active in front of the net, making it difficult for opponents to score. With a potent offense and a stifling defense, UCSB was able to comfortably win the majority of their games.

sports,The Antidote to Senioritis: Kate Pipkin and Nicholas Moreno De Alboran Shine in Final Seasons,8-Jun-19,10:33 AM,"['Jesse Morrison', 'Nick DiPierro']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-08/the-antidote-to-senioritis-kate-pipkin-and-nicholas-moreno-de-alboran-shine-in-final-seasons/,"Nexus File Photo Following the program's most successful season in school history, tallying 22 wins, women's water polo's Kate Pipkin walks away with this year's Senior of the Year honors. The fourth-year utility from Costa Mesa, California was recently named to the D-1 All-American team for her second consecutive season. Pipkin received the award after an outstanding senior season, leading the Gauchos in total points scored (76). These points were earned as a result of her being second on the team in goals with 45 scored and second in assists earned at 31. The senior captain was able to provide momentous leadership to a rather young team, which competed in a loaded Big West Conference. Pipkin made the most of her final season, playing in all 30 games and leading UCSB to a No. 3 finish in the conference tournament. After another outstanding campaign, she was selected to her third consecutive All-Big West team. The achievement makes Pipkin a perfect three for three on All-Conference selections since transferring from Indiana after her first year. Throughout the season, Pipkin showed off her well-balanced attack, found teammates in their spots and finished shots when given opportunities. Her scoring became imperative to the team's success late in the season, as she finished on a 10-game scoring streak, totaling 20 goals over those contests. Pipkin has been a cornerstone piece to the UCSB women's water polo team the past three years. Her competitive nature and passion for the game helped drive this team toward great successes. Because of this, Pipkin has earned the honor of being this year's Daily Nexus ""úFemale Senior of the Year.""ù UC Santa Barbara's Nicolas Moreno de Alboran during 2019 Big West Tennis Championships Day 4 at Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Sunday, April 28, 2019 in Indian Wells, California. (Photo/Josh Barber) UC Santa Barbara men's senior tennis star Nicolas Moreno de Alboran finished the season with a 28-9 record overall and a 15-3 performance in dual-match play while also taking home Big West Player of the Year honors for the second year in a row.  While previously holding the record for the highest-ranked Gaucho ever at No. 42 in the country upon the start of last season, de Alboran has viciously climbed the ladder where he now finds himself ranked No. 6 by the ITA Tennis National Ranking.  The senior stud is just the third Gaucho athlete to earn Division I All-American honors, following up David Decret's 1992 and Kip Brady's 1989 seasons.  As if we didn't already know of de Alboran's brilliance, he has also been invited to an exclusive 16-player wildcard tournament at the USTA National Campus in Orlando. He will be competing against eight of the top young players currently at the pro level in addition to the seven other elite college stars in which he has been recognized alongside.  So how did we get here?  UCSB started the season off strong, going 3-1 with wins over San Diego State, South Alabama and Fresno State.  Three straight losses to San Diego, Drake and Utah State now meant the Gauchos were sitting at a 3-4 record, hardly the start that winners of four straight tournament titles would expect.  Just as the group began to stumble out of the gates, they rattled off 14 wins in the final 17 games remaining to improve to an impressive 17-7.  De Alboran and Co. then proceeded to win their first NCAA tournament match since UCSB's 1998 win over Oregon.  Losses in doubles on courts one and two for both de Alboran and senior Anders Holm and sophomore Victor Krustev and junior Joseph Guillin, respectively, meant that UCSB would have to dominate in singles if they were to move on.  Down 1-0, senior Hironori Koyanagi did just that, winning 6-1, 6-0 to tie the match.  Koyanagi mentioned after the game that losing that doubles point led to ""únegative""ù energy among the team.  A win by sophomore Joseph Rotheram was quickly followed by de Alboran's comeback victory over Texas Tech's No. 75 junior Parker Wynn, putting the Gauchos up 3-1 before Guillin would seal the deal.  Call him the captain or call him a leader ""î it doesn't matter what your title is if you can't step up in the big moments. De Alboran did exactly that, proving why he has been so monumental for the Gauchos this season. The comeback point for the captain provided the extra cushion to fuel UCSB's first NCAA tournament win in two decades.  Unfortunately, UCSB fell to the hands of No. 12 Stanford in the second round. The season overall was well fought by a well trained and hardworking team led by none other than Nicolas Moreno de Alboran.

sports,"Houston, We Have a Problem: In Defense of Chris Paul",20-Jun-19,5:05 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-06-20/houston-we-have-a-problem-in-defense-of-chris-paul/,"Chris Paul is not the player he used to be. As a Chris Paul (CP3) fan, watching the playoffs this year was an oftentimes laborious task. Even with a big man like Kevon Looney switched onto him, Paul struggled to get to the hoop, demonstrating the lack of explosiveness that comes with 14 years in the league and a litany of soft-tissue injuries along the way. Save for his performance in game six against Golden State, Paul truly looked like a shell of his former self in the playoffs. I'll also be the first to admit that CP's contract is an albatross, with the aging guard due nearly 120 million dollars over the next three years. While it was a deal that general manager Daryl Morey had to make at the time, it will also severely limit the Rockets' financial flexibility in the near future. Still, I was shocked to see the reaction from the media when reports came out that Chris Paul had requested a trade from the Rockets after several fights with superstar James Harden. Nearly every report I read blamed Paul for the scuffles, claiming that Paul didn't know his place on the team and was the reason for the Rockets' inability to advance to the NBA finals the last two years. To be clear: the main disagreements between Paul and Harden stemmed from Paul wanting Harden to be involved off-the-ball and from Paul's desire to run more set plays instead of isolation sets on offense. For the life of me, I can't understand how Paul is in the wrong in this situation. Clearly, Paul recognizes he has lost a step on the offensive end, and rather than try to play iso-ball, he wants to run the offense like a traditional point guard. Even in the worst year of his career, Paul averaged nearly 16 points and more than eight assists per game in the Rockets' offense. While Paul's athleticism and finishing may be in decline, he still has elite vision and basketball IQ. If Morey and Harden could get over their egos, there is absolutely no reason Paul can't thrive at the twilight of his career. Before his back injuries, Steve Nash averaged more than ten assists per game as a 38 year old, and Paul and Nash have comparable playstyles. Now, there is no question that James Harden is an elite isolation player ""î undoubtedly the best in the NBA. In the regular season, that will allow you to put up historic numbers, as we saw with Harden's streak of 32 straight 30-point games. But in the postseason, with defenses keying in on you, it becomes much more difficult to just iso your way to a bucket. When Harden didn't iso in the postseason, the Rockets' offense had no flow ""î in large part due to his lack of effort off-the-ball. If Harden's style had been successful in past postseasons, I would argue that Paul should co-opt his style to allow Harden the freedom he needs on offense. But it simply hasn't garnered results in the postseason. Everyone likes to harp on Paul's choking in the postseason, but let's not forget that it was Harden who was benched in the 2015 postseason, and Harden who couldn't win either game six or game seven after Paul went down last year with an injury against Golden State. More than likely, Chris Paul will not be traded. While he is still a very effective player, he is quite obviously being overpaid with his contract, and few franchises will be eager to overpay for an aging, oft-injured point guard. In other words, Paul and Harden need to figure this out now, especially with the west wide open this season. At the end of the day, Houston needs to adapt its system to allow for both Paul and Harden to do what they do best. The reason Carmelo Anthony is no longer signed with an NBA team is because he was unable to recognize that his game needed to change as he got older. In a lot of ways, Paul has already done the hardest part by acknowledging that he isn't the same player he used to be and that he can't just take turns running isolation with Harden. Now, the Rockets need to do the same and create a system that maximizes the talents of this version of Paul and Harden. If they can do that, there is no reason this team can't win the title.

sports,"Despite Lack of Media Attention, Retooled Kings Poised to Make Noise in West",9-Jul-19,12:48 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-09/despite-lack-of-media-attention-retooled-kings-poised-to-make-noise-in-west/," Navigating the tumultuous waters of NBA free agency is tricky for any team. For a small market team like the Sacramento Kings, the task is nearly impossible.† Without the lure of a large market or a history of success, the Kings will almost never have a realistic shot of landing a big-name free agent. Even Al Horford ""î a second-tier free agent ""î turned down a massive four-year offer from the Kings, opting to take less money and join a proven contender with the 76ers. Given these limitations, it's no real surprise that the Kings received little to no media attention during the offseason; after all, the NBA is a superstar-driven league, and the Kings were (predictably) unable to grab one this offseason. But under the radar, the Kings may have had one of the smartest free agencies in recent memory, setting the team up for success in the coming years. Instead of overpaying for a second-tier superstar, the Kings bet that their current core of De'Aaron Fox, Marvin Bagley III and Buddy Hield will take another step forward this season. While his jump shot is still inconsistent, Fox showed off the tantalizing skill set last year that made him the No. 5 pick two years ago. Fox averaged 17.3 points per game and 7.3 assists per game but ""î perhaps most importantly ""î shot an impressive 37% from behind the arc. If teams start to respect Fox's jump shot, he can utilize his athleticism to get to the hoop at will.  Hield, meanwhile, did his best Steph Curry impression last year, leading the team with 20.7 points per game while shooting 42% from three. One of the best pure shooters in the NBA, Hield should again provide excellent floor spacing for the Kings. Despite being the most raw of the three, Bagley showcased his versatility and athleticism last year while only playing 25 minutes per game in his rookie season. Even without an effective jump shot, Bagley averaged almost 15 points per game ""î thanks in large part to his willingness to run the floor with Fox. While it is still a superstar league, last years' Raptors proved the importance of depth in making a postseason run. With the skill sets of these three in mind, the Kings made a myriad of shrewd signings to provide the team with the talent and depth necessary to compete in a loaded western conference. For starters, the Kings locked up Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $85 million contract. Considering the five-year, $180 million contract Tobias Harris signed with the 76ers, this deal feels like an incredible value. Somehow, Barnes is still only 27, and in his 28 games with the Kings last year, he shot the three at almost a 41% clip. With his athleticism and size, Barnes can guard multiple positions, making him a valuable defensive asset. Most importantly, the contract is front-loaded, meaning that the Kings will have the necessary cap space to resign their big three when they hit free agency. Outside of Barnes, all of the Kings' free agency moves revolved around creating a solid bench unit.† Dewayne Dedmon is a stretch five who averaged almost 11 points for the Hawks last year, displaying a natural shooting touch that should create space for the Kings' athletic guards. Trevor Ariza is a veteran who has proven his worth time and time again, and while he struggled last year with both the Suns and the Wizards, he should be more engaged on a much more competitive team. Only two years ago, Ariza proved his worth on the Rockets, and his size and acumen make him an above-average defender, as well as a solid veteran to mentor the younger players on the roster. Finally, while the signing may not be attractive, Cory Joseph will provide the Kings with a steady hand to run the second unit when Fox needs a breather. Joseph will never put up gaudy numbers, but his 3.9:1 assist-to-turnover ratio from last year shows his reliability and willingness to find open teammates. The caveat for these moves, of course, is the abundance of talent in the western conference. Even with their newfound depth, the Kings will have to battle just to make the playoffs in one of the deepest conferences in recent memory. Still, the Kings made all the necessary moves to compete as a small market team. If Fox, Hield and Bagley can take a step forward, there is no reason this team can't make the playoffs next year and even compete in a seven-game series against a top team.

sports,How the West Stacks Up: Conference Seeding Predictions,16-Jul-19,11:55 PM,['Nithesh Perumal'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-16/how-the-west-stacks-up-conference-seeding-predictions/,"  With the NBA free agency frenzy coming to an end, NBA teams and fans alike can start looking toward the upcoming season. The 2019-20 season features a drastically different NBA landscape and although it's impossible to know exactly how the season will play out at this moment, there are favorites even amongst a high-parity Western Conference. †No. 1 Seed: LA Clippers With the recent acquisition of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, the Clippers are widely considered the favorites for the championship this season. Jerry West took an already stellar defensive team and added the two best defensive wings in the game. They are the favorites to win it all and it is very clear why. †No. 2 Seed: Denver Nuggets The Nuggets looked like a strong team that fought and clawed its way to the No. 2 seed this prior season with a very young roster. Eventually losing in the second round in a game seven, the Nuggets added depth and athleticism with Jerami Grant. The team performed phenomenally. However, with no set small forward in their rotation and the defensive issues from starting point guard Jamal Murray, there are concerns that need to be addressed going into the next season. The Denver squad will be a very good team, but are still one or two years off from being a true contender. †No. 3 seed: LA Lakers The Lakers on paper look like a very scary team. An Anthony Davis and LeBron James pick and roll is every team's worst nightmare, especially when Danny Green is spotting up for a three in the wing. Running LeBron at the point, this roster is huge and will present a lot of problems for teams offensively and on the boards. Notice how I didn't say defensively there. With the prevalence of stretch fives, it's not too hard to scheme around Anthony Davis' abilities as a rim protector. In addition, DeMarcus Cousins and LeBron James leave much to be desired defensively. Going into year 17, LeBron is definitely not playing the best defense of his career and Cousins, who was always a step slower, has just suffered two major injuries to his knee and quadricep and is thus going to be a huge asterisk defensively. Davis is also known for getting knicks and knacks here and there that keep him out for short periods of time, but in this neck-and-neck Western Conference, that will cost LA some games and their seeding.† 4 seed: Houston Rockets Houston may have started falling apart before our very eyes after being eliminated by a Kevin Durant less Warriors team. Chris Paul and James Harden are feuding because of the playstyle they play ""ì which favors Harden and no one else. It's clear that the players and administration have lost all faith in Head Coach Mike D'antoni and Free Agency did not go in their favor at all as they did not sign any notable Free agents and are set to run it back with almost the same team. Here's the catch however: GM Daryl Morey might of just saved all of their blunders by trading for a league MVP and former teammate of James Harden, Russel Westbrook. Their isolation playstyle has not panned out now 3 years in a row and is unlikely to work a 4th, but with Westbrook and Hardens pre-existing chemistry and D'antoni reverting back to his Phoenix offense rather than his current iso offense, Houston has effectively reopened their window for a championship. They switched out an aging star with injury concerns to replace him with a high octane player who has a reputation for being the ironman of the NBA. There are concerns with Westbrook's scoring efficiency, but the elite level playmaking he brings to any squad is well worth any offensive concern one might have. †No. 5 seed: Utah Jazz Utah has been one very strong defensive unit that has stukk largely underperformed in the playoffs due to offensive inconsistencies. The addition of veteran Mike Conley Jr. and ISO scorer Bojan Bogdanoviƒá address their one glaring concern and could make Utah a dark horse threat in a close Western Conference, especially if Donovan Mitchell can take that next step and play at an all-star level. †No. 6 seed: Portland Trail Blazers Portland was notorious as a team that did really well seeding wise but could never take that next step and convert regular-season success to playoff success. All of this changed when they made the Western Conference finals last year. They accomplished this feat without their third star Jusuf Nurkiƒá who suffered an injury late in the season leading up to the playoffs. So why are they seeded so low? They lost one of their key roleplayers Seth Curry in Free agency and its unlikely they get the same production from Rodney Hood going forward. Nurkic who was already a defensive liability has just taken a lower leg injury which won't bode well defensively. The Trail Blazers 2 man duo of Lillard and McCollum can only carry this team so far on their own without a clear cut third option, and adding Hasan Whiteside who is little more than an elite rebounder does little to solve this problem. †7 seed: Golden State Warriors I know what you're saying, they made the finals the last 5 years straight how are they suddenly a 7 seed. Losing Kevin Durant is bad, especially since Klay Thompson is injured as well, but on top of this the Dubs lost backup guard Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, and Andre Iguodala. All of that and the only addition is D'angelo Russel. Yes Russel is an All Star, yes he is an exciting young player. But the fit next to Steph is frankly terrible. Both are defensive liabilities and D'angelo Russel is extremely pick and roll dependent while the Warriors run very little Pick and Roll and instead prefer a very fluid ball movement offense. Also what's Russels fit when Klay comes back? Are Steph, Klay, and Russel going to be on the court together, if so that lineup will be extremely undersized especially compared to the rest of the Western Conference teams, which all have notable size to take advantage of smaller lineups. Furthermore the Raptors showed how easy it was to neutralize Curry when he was the sole offensive option with a Box and 1 Defense. In conclusion the warriors lost their best player to Free Agency as well as the little depth that they had to add a player who is ill fitting to their game plan. ††8 seed: Sacramento Kings The Kings have done a lot of things right in the last few years. They got rid of bad contracts and built a deep young team from the draft and brought in pieces to facilitate their young nucleus' growth. They have stellar perimeter play from Bogdan Bogdonovic (not to be confused with Bojan Bogdonovic), Buddy Hield, and De'aaron Fox as well as a versatile and athletic front court with Marvin Bagley III and Dewane Dedmon. This team then resigns a talented young wing in Harrison Barnes and signs veteran perimeter defender Trevor Ariza ""ì while also adding depth to the backcourt by adding Corey Joseph. This team was trending toward a playoff berth without all of their additions, but with their recent acquisitions the Kings are poised to take the next step while also allowing their young core enough freedom to continue their development. † † †

sports,Free Agency Creates Pressing Questions About Player Movement,17-Jul-19,12:07 AM,['Nithesh Perumal'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-07-17/free-agency-creates-pressing-questions-about-player-movement/," †The 2019 free-agent class, largely considered to be one of the most prolific crops of players ever, has more or less come to an end about a week and a half after starting on June 30. †In the first day of free agency alone, almost three billion dollars of money were inked in contracts across the league as a whole. Some of these were expected contracts, like the 76ers giving its budding superstar Ben Simmons a max extension and the Warriors giving Klay Thompson a max contract as well. Other deals were a lot less expected, like Jimmy Butler signing with the Heat and Al Horford signing a four-year 110 million dollar deal from the 76ers as he approaches age 34. †Now we get to the absolute shocker, the deal so unexpected some consider it to be downright blasphemous: Kawhi Leonard signing the max with the Clippers. †In fairness, Kawhi Leonard signing with the Clippers is not the issue here. He is an eligible free agent and can exercise his right to sign with a new team. The issue comes because he recruited a second star, Paul George from the OKC Thunder, to join him in LA. †After trying to get Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to join him on the Clippers to no avail (both of whom signed with Brooklyn promptly at the start of free agency), Leonard convinced a player who finished third in MVP voting and who just had his career-best year to leave his team while under a three-year contract. †As soon as the deal ended, everyone called foul.Paul George forced his way out of Indiana, Leonard had his drama with San Antonio two years later, Anthony Davis created a commotion in NOLA to be traded to the Lakers earlier this year, and now Paul George yet again forced his way out of another team in OKC. †The increased player movement seen in the last decade has been a controversial topic amongst NBA fans. When I say player movement, I'm not referring to teaming up in free agency; I'm specifically referring to under-contract players who force their team's hand in an attempt to leave their respective organization. †Some fans are pro-player and feel it is well within a player's right to leave their current team if he does not want to be there any more. Their reasoning is that when teams trade players away it's considered a business move and when players leave, it should be seen in a similar light. †Other fans, however, are less in favor of the players, citing that large-market teams are usually the continued benefactors of this movement, relegating the smaller markets to be in the background of the league. New Orleans was an irrelevant team until they landed generational talent, Anthony Davis. But Davis forced his way out of NOLA to the Lakers, who have been a major market since the beginning of basketball itself. †The current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) has provisions to try to incentivize players to stay loyal to a franchise with large monetary benefits the incumbent teams can present ""î however, in this free agency alone, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard gave up a combined 200 million dollars in financial benefits by moving to their new respective teams. †It's very apparent that for the elite-level players, the financial incentives presented by the CBA are not enough to mitigate their movement. †So where do we go from here? NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been vocal in trying to explore new incentives and methods to mitigate the current level of player movement. Prominent media members are split on the issue and some have called for radical changes, like having players not be trade eligible for X number of years after signing to prevent them from forcing their way out.†† †Halting player movement entirely isn't ideal either. Player movement adds a necessary intrigue to the league but the current level has shifted the landscape of the NBA too drastically and too often to allow it to continue at this level. Although it is unlikely that any rules to stop the phenomenon will come soon, be on the lookout for some big changes to come in the upcoming years.† Comments are closed.

In August, violence would erupt in Charlottesville, Virginia, burning the images of tiki torches and Confederate flags into the collective consciousness of the American people. By December, 2017 would become the deadliest year for mass shootings to date. Grilling hot dogs and belting along to ""úAmerican Pie""ù this Fourth sounded like throwing a birthday party in a burning building. Kate Ryan / Daily Nexus It was the patent symbolism ""î the bald eagles, the stars and stripes, the garish triad of red, white and blue ""î that made me uneasy. These were the icons proudly displayed by the neo-Nazis and white nationalists who crawled out of the woodwork and into Trump's rallies in 2016. With MAGA supporters chanting ""úBuild the wall!""ù in one breath and ""úUSA! USA!""ù in the next, the line between patriotism and nationalism was blurry, at least in the public's perception.† Two years later, in 2019, not much had changed. After watching ""úFahrenheit 11/9,""ù Michael Moore's 2016 election documentary, I lay face down on the couch, cynicism coursing through my veins. The sea of devastated faces at Clinton campaign headquarters; the corruption festering in our voting system; Obama drinking the water in Flint ""î these images leached away what little remained of my faith in this democracy. Three days later, I sat in the same spot, a crowd screaming ""úUSA! USA!""ù on TV again. Only this time, it wasn't at a Trump rally. It was at a soccer game in Lyon, France. A soccer dropout at age 10, I'd never had much interest in ""úthe beautiful game.""ù I would rather watch ""úBend It Like Beckham""ù than sit field-side at my siblings' matches. Yet I found myself caught up in the excitement of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, mesmerized not only by the U.S. team's athletic prowess, but also by the players themselves. Social media fed my newfound obsession. I delighted in the training camp vlogs (including one that was filmed at UCSB), player biographies and compilations of funny moments featured on U.S. Soccer's YouTube channel. I watched these women dominate on the field, crack jokes, work out and sing on buses, cars and planes. Camaraderie was essential to their game: these players were fiercely competitive and fiercely loving of both their sport and one another.† When I read about their fight for gender parity, my admiration grew. Players like Alex Morgan have spoken about how beating the drum increases the pressure to win. Yet not once have they folded ""î not against the U.S. Soccer Federation, which pays female athletes nearly a third of what it pays males, despite the women's team consistently outperforming the men's and generating considerably more revenue ""î and certainly not against the competition. The team's victory in the final match amplified the chants of ""úEQUAL PAY! EQUAL PAY!""ù that rang throughout Stade de Lyon. The feud between Trump and the team, which erupted on Twitter, could not have been more symbolic of the political moment. About halfway through the tournament, a reporter for the soccer magazine Eight by Eight asked co-captain Megan Rapinoe whether or not the team planned to visit the White House if they won.† Infinitely more American than the ""úgood old days""ù of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team's vision of progress. ""úI'm not going to the fucking White House,""ù Rapinoe shot back. The next day, Trump retorted with, ""úMegan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!""ù Their 2-0 victory in the Cup final ""î including a goal by Rapinoe ""î spoke for itself. Which brings me to the centerpiece of my fascination: the lavender-haired winner of the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards, the undisputed star of the World Cup and the new face of women's soccer, Megan Anna Rapinoe.† Though her fame reached new heights during this summer's World Cup, Rapinoe has been a leader on and off the field for years. In 2016, she was one of five players to file a federal complaint against the U.S. Soccer Federation for wage discrimination and is one of 28 plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed three months before the 2019 Cup. She also sparked controversy for kneeling during the national anthem in support of Colin Kaepernick at a Seattle Reign game in 2016.† ""úBeing a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties,""ù Rapinoe said afterwards. ""úIt's important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this.""ù As a team spokesperson, Rapinoe leads with grace and an effervescent sense of humor. She doesn't talk trash ""î not even about the head of the U.S. Soccer Federation, Carlos Cordeiro, who was booed by the crowd at the team's post-victory New York City ticker-tape parade. ""úI think he's with us. I think he's on the right side of things. I think he's going to make things right,""ù she said. ""úWe look forward to holding those feet to the fire.""ù In a rousing victory speech, Rapinoe addressed, among other things, the diversity of the team: ""úWe have pink hair and purple hair. We have tattoos, dreadlocks. We've got white girls, black girls and everything in between. Straight girls, gay girls.""ù Observing the reactions of the crowd, itself a mishmosh of young and old, white, brown and black, I cannot overstate the importance of this message. Highlighting this intersection of identities is not just preaching to the liberal choir or a PR stunt. The U.S. women's national team paints a far more accurate picture of America than the almost exclusively white-male Trump administration does. Its players embody the values of compassion, honor and resilience that are so lacking in our national politics.† Megan Rapinoe's dissent ""î and absolute kickassery ""î is a form of patriotism that I can get behind. Not only is it essential that Americans see themselves in this team but also that the world see America in this team. Broadcasted on hundreds of networks and reaching a record number of viewers (approximately 1 billion) worldwide, the World Cup winning team represented an America that other parts of the world may not otherwise get to see. Infinitely more American than the ""úgood old days""ù of autocracy and white supremacism fondly recalled by Trump is this team's vision of progress. ""úThis is my charge to everyone: We have to be better. We have to love more, hate less. We've got to listen more and talk less,""ù Rapinoe said as she neared the end of her speech. ""úIt's our responsibility to make the world a better place.""ù Following Team USA's triumph, much champagne was spilled and ""úWe Are the Champions""ù sang. But their victory was a celebration of female friendship, sportsmanship and hard work, rather than the boastful nationalism that often colors patriotic rhetoric.† As much as I love watching these athletes play, I value them more for what they inspire. And I don't just mean the children who dream of going pro ""î that doesn't account for their devoted fan base or the millions who tuned in to watch the World Cup.† They inspire me to make the most of the platform I have to advocate for what I believe in. I may be too far gone for the soaring idealism of the American dream, but Megan Rapinoe's dissent ""î and absolute kickassery ""î is a form of patriotism that I can get behind. Her courage moves me profoundly, evoking the same feeling the national anthem used to, the feeling of belonging to something bigger than myself ""î if not to a country, than to a dream. I am learning that the two are not mutually exclusive. In the fall, I will be studying abroad. I used to joke that when asked where I'm from, I'll just say ""úCalifornia""ù to avoid being associated with Trump's America. But now, knowing that this is also the America of the U.S. Women's National Team, red, white and blue ""î with a dash of lavender ""î doesn't seem so bad to rep after all. Here's to you, USWNT. May we all live up to the four stars on your jerseys. If anyone has connections to Megan Rapinoe or the World Cup ticketing office, please contact Harper Lambert immediately.

sports,Gauchos Set to Kick Off Season With Exhibition Match in LA,16-Aug-19,1:56 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-16/gauchos-set-to-kick-off-season-with-exhibition-match-in-la/,"Christine Maurer fights for the ball. Nexus File Photo Folks, the wait is officially over.  We will finally get our first taste of Gaucho soccer this Friday as UCSB hits the road to play Cal State Los Angeles in an exhibition match. This game will not count toward any of the teams' regular season records; however, it serves as a great tune-up opportunity for both the Gauchos and the Golden Eagles. This game probably means very little when looking at the season as a whole and the long-term goals that the Gauchos have set for themselves; however, Head Coach Paul Stumpf and his staff are surely using this game as a chance to gauge the squad's readiness for the regular season, and also to correct any flaws that show themselves throughout the contest. Friday's match will be the first time the UCSB women's soccer team has seen the field since their season-ending loss to Long Beach State in last year's conference championship game. That loss solidified their season record at a respectable 13-7-1 overall and 5-2-1 in Big West play. The Gauchos graduated 13 seniors from last year including three All-Conference contributors whose roles still need to be filled. But even with the departure of several key contributors, the Gauchos were still picked to finish second in the conference according to the Big West coaches poll that was released earlier this week. This exhibition provides a perfect opportunity to see how the players are fitting into their new roles and what the current rotations look like as we move closer to the start of the regular season. Probably the biggest storyline to keep an eye on as we head into another year of Gaucho soccer is the return of Shaelan Murison.  The senior forward is coming off of a First Team All-Conference selection last season, as well as a preseason All-Conference selection heading into this year. Murison started all 21 games for the Blue and Gold a season ago, leading the team in goals with 10, points with 24, as well as game-winning goals, of which she had five. As the best returning player on a talented team, Murison will be responsible for a lot of the offensive production this year, but she will also have to take on a larger leadership role as one of the six seniors on this Gaucho squad. In this season-opener against Cal State LA, she will likely take her first steps toward getting used to her increased role.† Another player to look out for in this exhibition is senior midfielder Lynsee Voss, whose three goals a season ago puts her behind Murison for the second most goals scored among returning players. Voss appeared in 16 games and started in 14, and both of those numbers should increase this season along with her role within the team.† Junior midfielder Christine Maurer, who, despite only scoring two goals last season, finished second on the team in shots and shots on goal, with 41 and 19 respectively, could be another key cog for UCSB.  With just a few adjustments and some off-season improvement we might see Maurer take a big leap this year in terms of offensive efficiency.  We will also get our first look at some of the 14 freshmen that will be donning the Gaucho uniform for the first time this Friday. The competition between newcomers for playing time is sure to be fierce and this match could be a determining factor in who wins a starting spot for Santa Barbara's season opener. While this matchup might have no actual bearing on the upcoming season, there's bound to be many interesting smaller takeaways as we get to see the team in action for the first time. The Gauchos will take on Cal State LA at Jesse Owens Stadium on Friday at 6 p.m..

sports,"Gauchos Return to Harder, Take on Westmont",17-Aug-19,3:44 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/gauchos-return-to-harder-take-on-westmont/,"Christine Maurer dives to intercept a pass. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus After a productive offseason, the UCSB women's soccer team will begin their season this Saturday against Westmont in an exhibition game at Harder Stadium. Santa Barbara is looking to build off of their successful campaign last year as they finished the year with a record of 13-7-1. The Westmont Warriors began their season this past Thursday when they fell to Southern Oregon by a score of 2-1. Despite a hot start with senior midfielder Brooke Porter scoring in the eighth minute of the contest, the Warriors gave up two second-half goals and were unable to get the equalizer. The Warriors are led by junior goalkeeper Gabi Haw, who is the reigning Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) Co-Player of the year. She finished with four saves against Southern Oregon. Senior forward Maddi Berthoud and sophomore midfielder Teagan Matye have led the offensive attack for Westmont and will look to make more of an impact this upcoming Saturday. Even though the result will not count toward the Gauchos' overall record, it will be crucial for Santa Barbara to remain focused and play hard as they develop an identity for this season. There is a lot of hype around this Gauchos' squad as they have been picked to finish second in the Big West Conference this upcoming season. Many attribute this to senior forward Shaelan Murison, who finished last year with ten goals. In order for the ""òChos to have success this year, they will look to Murison to finish off scoring opportunities in addition to being a playmaker for her teammates. With seven starters returning for Santa Barbara, there is a sense that the team will be able to build on their chemistry from last season. One of the biggest returners is senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese is the anchor of the Gauchos' defense and has proven to be a force in front of the goal with her quick instincts and decisive decision-making. Despite the return of several starters, there are a couple of newcomers who will surely have a role this upcoming season. Junior defender Emma Vanderhyden seems to be a popular choice for being the player who could potentially have the biggest impact early on in the season.† The Eastern Washington transfer has already played two years at the collegiate level, making it seem likely that she will be in the starting lineup. UCSB will look to Vanderhyden to stabilize the back end of the field and slow down the transition counters by their opponents. In order for the Gauchos to improve from last season, it will be key for them to continue to grow on the offensive end of the field. With Murison most likely to be doubled by the Warriors when she enters the box area, it will be crucial for other Gauchos to step up and find the back of the net. This will not only take pressure off of Murison but also give the other Gauchos the confidence to know that they are† just as capable to score. If UCSB is able to play each game with consistent energy and attention to detail, they will not only have a chance to win most of their games but potentially win the Big West as well. Since the team is composed of both veterans and young talent, many believe this will be the year the Gauchos win the conference title. Head coach Paul Stumpf will surely look to his seniors to provide leadership for his younger players on the pitch as well, especially in times of adversity during a game. It all starts this Saturday when the UCSB women's soccer team faces Westmont in an exhibition match at 5:30 p.m. at Harder Stadium.

sports,UCSB Opens Up Season Against Westmont in Bryant and Sons Cup,17-Aug-19,3:07 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-17/ucsb-opens-up-season-against-westmont-in-bryant-and-sons-cup/,"Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus Summer soccer is here as the Gauchos seek to get things started on the right foot with their annual home matchup against the Westmont Warriors. This will be one of UCSB's two exhibition games before the start of non-conference play on Aug. 30. The Gauchos are building off of last season where they finished with a 10-6-2 record. They managed to close out their previous campaign with a nice five-game undefeated streak; however, their postseason aspirations were cut short due to a penalty shootout which led to Cal State Fullerton advancing ahead of them. After a successful spring season, ending in a four-game winning streak, the Gauchos will look to keep the momentum rolling into fall. Westmont also finished last year with an overall record of 10-6-2. Still, their playoff hopes ended in a 2-1 loss to the Vanguard Lions in their conference's semifinals. This will be the Warrior's third game of the preseason, coming off a pair of scrimmages against their very own alumni and the Trinity Western Spartans. Starting off the season against Westmont has become a tradition of sorts for UCSB ""î this is now the 57th edition of the game sponsored by Bryant & Sons. Their last meeting went heavily in favor of the home side as the Gauchos routed the Warriors by a score of 7-0. UCSB does have the historical advantage when it comes to this matchup however. As of their last meet, the Gauchos now lead the Warriors by a record of 28-24-4. Junior forward Rodney Michael will definitely be a player to keep your eye on for the Gauchos. In the 18 games he played last season, Michael contributed a team-leading total of seven goals and also threw in three assists, earning himself a spot on the 2018 All-Big West First Team and 2018 All-Far West Region First Team. Michael is primed to fill up the scoresheets once more this season as the former 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year looks to play a vital first-team role for Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg. In the middle of the pitch, senior midfielder Thibault Candia seems to be the man pulling all the strings. The French playmaker tallied a team-leading seven assists last year, along with a goal, in the 18 games he featured in. At the backline is senior center back Faouzi Taieb, who made his presence known at both ends of the field considering he finished last season as the team's second-highest goalscorer from a defensive position. He was also one of only three players who started all 18 games consecutively. Taieb's potential impact for the Gauchos this season is just another exciting storyline we'll have to wait to see unfold as the new season progresses. The kick off time is slated for 7:30 p.m. on Saturday Aug. 17, with the preseason promo including schedule posters and post-game autographs for fans.

sports,Gauchos Squeak By Warriors in Physical Season Opener,18-Aug-19,8:09 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-18/gauchos-squeak-by-warriors-in-physical-season-opener/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus The UCSB men's soccer team outlasted the Westmont Warriors 1-0 in their first exhibition match of the season.† Although this was the second year in a row that the Gauchos were able to win the annual Bryant and Sons Cup matchup between these two Santa Barbara teams, this game couldn't have been any more different than the 7-0 blowout a season ago. The two teams combined for 28 fouls, 10 yellow cards, and one red card in what turned out to be an extremely chippy ""úfriendly""ù match.† The match started out rocky, but not due to any bad blood between the two squads. Because of NCAA guidelines, both teams only had around three practices with their full coaching staff prior to the game, which meant that the chemistry and crispness that comes along as the season progresses really wasn't there for either side. UCSB opened up the match by sending a few long-balls over the top to star forward Rodney Michaels, compensating for their lack of technical sharpness by attempting to take advantage of their speed at the forward position. Westmont held strong however, and came out of the gates playing an extremely physical style of defense that actually managed to stifle the Gauchos for most of the game. This aggressiveness came back to bite them pretty quickly however, as in the 9th minute of the game a questionable foul call on the Warriors gave the Gauchos a free kick about 22 yards out from goal. Senior midfielder Thibault Candia stepped up and sent a perfectly curled ball to the back post which senior defender Faouzi Taieb headed home after leaping over the Westmont defense, giving UCSB and Taieb their first goal of the year. As the first half wore on, a couple of patterns began to emerge that would continue to play out until the final whistle.  The Gauchos would typically maintain possession on their side of the pitch, but just couldn't complete the final pass once they got into the attacking third. Westmont was more than happy to stay back and aggressively cut off passing lanes hoping to create some fast-break opportunities. One such opportunity arose in the 20th minute when Warriors' midfielder Jose Vargas intercepted a sloppy clearance by senior Kaya Fabretti on the Gauchos' side of the pitch. Vargas seemed to have a clear path to goal but Fabretti raced back to make a tackle and eventually push the ball up-field. UCSB just seemed to be a step too slow throughout the whole game, although how much of it was rust and how much was simply underestimating their NAIA opponent can't really be calculated, and the Westmont D led by the stone wall that is senior defender Tim Heiduk made sure that openings were few and far between in the first half. The Gauchos came out of the locker room in the second half with a revamped intensity, partially sparked by the play of freshman Lucas Gonzalez. The LA Galaxy Academy product was all over the pitch in his first official game for UCSB, playing with not just energy but also a surprising composure that will potentially earn him more minutes as the season wears on.† Gonzalez set up Candia with a beautiful pass in the 48th minute that led to a cross into the middle that was easily cleared by a Warrior defender. This clearance would prove to be significant however, as it went out to Westmont's Justin Nakaoka who was then fouled and shoved by Kaya Fabretti. A small scuffle ensued when Jose Vargas came running and shoved senior forward Ignacio Tellechea to the ground, and eventually Fabretti, Vargas and Tellechea all received yellow cards. The scuffle seemed to serve as a spark plug for both teams, as the intensity of the match drastically increased right after. This culminated into one of the more exciting sequences in the game in the 70th minute.† Westmont midfielder Samuel Toscano intercepted a bad pass in the back-half and streaked across to the right side of the box leaving nobody between him and UCSB goalie Alan Carrillo. He then sent a wild cross in that somehow ended up at the feet of Rodney Michaels, who took the ball the entire length of the pitch the other way and sent a perfect pass to a wide-open forward Carter Clemmenson who banged the ball off the near post. While the last twenty minutes did have a few close opportunities for both teams, the most interesting part might have been junior defender Omari Fontes' five minutes of action. He entered in the 80th minute, received a questionable yellow card for a seemingly mundane tackle one minute later, then was ejected in the 85th minute after getting another yellow card for shoving a Westmont player in the back. The Gauchos were then forced to play out the rest of the game with ten men, but they eventually came out with the win. It's tough to draw too many conclusions from an exhibition match but UCSB does need to be weary of a few things moving forward. Problems with creating goals and finishing offensive sequences in the final third have haunted this team since last season, and were a big reason that they couldn't advance further in the Big West Tournament. While rust and a lack of chemistry definitely played a role in this last game, there will have to be a quick return to form for the Gauchos as they prepare for a tough upcoming slate of games including matchups against UNLV, CAL, Virginia Tech, and Gonzaga.

The Gauchos' offense relentlessly attacked the opposition and their defense limited the Warriors' goal-scoring attempts in a great all-around effort. UCSB got out and attacked early, as they put seven shots on goal in the first 22 minutes of action before senior Shaelan Murison got behind the keeper and scored to put the Gauchos on the board first in the 26th minute. Santa Barbara did not have to wait long to get some more offensive production as they extended their lead thanks to junior Angelica Ortega's goal at the 40-minute mark, assisted by sophomore forward Jessica Wright.† The Gauchos coasted into halftime with a comfortable lead and a dominant half of soccer under their belt. UCSB's ten shots compared to only one for Westmont showed the clear advantage that the Gauchos held on both sides of the ball and it was a trend that continued for the rest of the game as Westmont only managed one shot on goal for the entire match. Head Coach Paul Stumpf used this exhibition as an opportunity to spread around the playing time amongst players, and with a comfortable 2-0 lead, it proved to be the perfect time to get some of the reserves and younger players into the game.† The first major substitution made came right after the half, as sophomore Natalie Hill relieved the starting goalkeeper, senior Hanna DeWeese. Hill remained in goal for about 23 minutes before freshman keeper Evann Smith relieved her and played out the final 22 minutes, where she recorded the team's only save of the night. The rest of the starters remained in the game until the 54th minute, when Stumpf pulled them all to get other players some minutes. Westmont was able to keep the game somewhat interesting as they outshot the UCSB reserves 4-1 in the final 36 minutes of action, but they could not turn any of those opportunities into goals and time expired to give the Gauchos the 2-0 win. Murison lead the way for the Gauchos with a game-high eight shots, six shots on goal, and one goal that gave Santa Barbara an early lead. Wright finished second on the team with four shots, two on goal, and she assisted on the Gauchos second and final goal of the game. Ortega scored the second goal of the game in the 40th minute, and it was one of her two shots on the day, with both of them being on goal. As for Westmont, there were not many shots to be had on offense, as the Gaucho defense gave them trouble all game, and senior Maddi Berthoud was the only Westmont player to have more than one shot attempt, with two. Midfielder Brooke Porter was the only Warrior to take a shot on goal, and her attempt in the 85th minute was blocked by Smith of UCSB. Westmont's junior goalie Gabi Haw probably had the busiest day out of any player who took the field, as she had to defend the 16 Gaucho shots and 11 shots on goal. She played the full 90 minutes and finished with nine saves and two goals given up. This match served as a productive final tune-up before the regular season begins and the Gauchos embark on a very tough non-conference schedule. UCSB will play their next game back at Harder Stadium against the Minnesota Golden Gophers on Thursday, August 22, at 7:00 p.m.

Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus The UCSB Gauchos women's soccer team will open their 2019 non-conference schedule this Thursday against the Minnesota Golden Gophers at Harder Stadium.† Santa Barbara will look to slow down a talented Golden Gophers squad that made it all the way to the second round of the NCAA Tournament a year ago. Minnesota finished seventh in the Big Ten in 2018, but they managed to pull off three straight wins in the Big Ten tournament and secure their NCAA tourney birth. They are expected to be more of the same this season, as the Golden Gophers were picked to finish sixth in the Big Ten Women's Soccer Preseason Poll.† Minnesota returns no All-Big Ten performers this year; however, three of their players have been selected to the 2019 Big Ten Women's Soccer Preseason Honor's List. Junior midfielder Athena Kuehn, junior midfielder Celina Nummerdor, and senior defensemen Nikki Albrecht will be tasked with leading the Golden Gophers back to the tournament this year. Last season, the trio combined to miss only one game the entire season and totalled three goals and twelve points during that time. Another player to watch on the Golden Gophers is junior goalkeeper Maddie Nielsen. Nielsen played in all 23 games and finished fourth in the Big Ten with 77 saves to go along with 9 shutouts, a number that ranked second in the conference. It will be fascinating to see how Nielsen will continue to improve throughout this season, but for now she will be tasked with stopping the offensive onslaught of the Gauchos. Santa Barbara and Minnesota have met three times prior to Thursday's action, with Minnesota taking each of the first two contests in 2010 and 2011, before falling to the Gauchos 1-0 in 2017.† The ""òChos will look to take the momentum from their 2-0 exhibition win over Westmont on Saturday and translate it to success against a superior opponent.† On the offensive end it will most likely be senior Shaelan Murison who leads the charge for UCSB. Based on what we saw in the match against Westmont, Murison will be getting a lot of touches and taking the bulk of the shots for the Gauchos. This likely trend would be no surprise as just a season ago, Murison lead all Big West players in shot attempts by nearly double, and her 10 goals ranked second in the conference. Senior forward Katherine Sheehy will also be highly involved on offense based on her stats from a season ago, where she finished second in the Big West with five assists.† On the defensive side of the field, senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese is the player to watch. In 2018, DeWeese proved herself to be an elite keeper when she allowed only 15 goals on the season, good enough to rank second among all goalkeepers in the Big West. Her .800 save percentage and .94 average goals-against also placed in the top three in the Big West. DeWeese will look to take the next step in her senior year and compete for the Big West's goalkeeper of the year award.† Another player to keep your eye on in this season-opener is Lauren Hess. Hess was named to the All-Freshman team in 2018 as a defender after seeing the field in all 21 games and making an impact on a team that came very close to the NCAA tournament. On Thursday it will be interesting to see how Hess has improved during the off-season and if her role has expanded at all after a stellar freshman campaign. The game will be played at 7:00 p.m. on Thursday at Harder Stadium.

sports,2019-20 Season Preview: Continuity and Consistency Keys to Winning for Men's Water Polo,22-Aug-19,7:36 AM,"['Spencer Ault', 'Jesse Morrison']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-continuity-and-consistency-keys-to-winning-for-mens-water-polo/,"Nexus File Photo/Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara men's water polo team is coming off of one of its best seasons in recent history. The team finished with an 18-8 record overall, while going 3-1 against Golden Coast Conference opponents. The Gauchos earned the No. 4 ranking in the country after several notable wins against teams like Long Beach State, Pepperdine and UC Irvine. UCSB saw great success last year thanks to their skilled offensive attack and the team's unified defense. The Gauchos will look to ride that momentum entering the 2019 season. Hoping to end the season strong, the Gaucho's final home game against rival Pepperdine was unfortunately canceled because of the tragic fires that raged down the Southern California coast. Entering the 2019 season, men's water polo should continue to rack up W's and climb the ranks, after losing only one senior. Entering this 2019 season, the Gaucho's will be led by star senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic. Coming off of a career year in which he scored 48 goals, Gvozdanovic should continue to see offensive success in his final season at UCSB. Perhaps the part of his game that doesn't get recognized or talked about enough is his spectacular all-around defense. Gvozdanovic is often given the responsibility of matching up against the opponent's best scorer, and he does not usually disappoint. Last season he led the team in steals, tallying 37 swipes in only 26 games played. Another player to look out for this season is the third-year big man out of Chicago, Illinois: Mason McQuet. The 6'3""ù and 200-pound center defender has turned heads in his first two seasons for his solid all-around game and tenacious defense. Mcquet is well known for his tremendous work ethic in the weight room and the classroom, and it shows in his efficient yet gritty style of play. McQuet should see an increased role amongst the team's minutes rotation as he enters his third season. Lastly, watch out for second year transfer student Danny Roland. The 6'3""ù sophomore out of San Rafael, California transferred from UCLA, the team that won the 2017 NCAA championship. Roland has quick hands and very strong legs, allowing him to cover shooting angles and pick up saves. Roland played for a very well-respected NorCal club team known as SHAQ (Sleepy Hollow Aquatic Club). His time in the club pipeline has helped prepare him to compete against the high-level athletes at the D-1 level. Difficult matchups dot the UC Santa Barbara schedule. UCSB is scheduled to play nine games against teams that finished last season ranked in the top 20 nationally, including one game against each member of last year's top four. Those four ""î USC, Stanford, UCLA, and Cal ""î were responsible for† seven of UCSB's† eight losses last year, so there will be opportunities for both revenge and resume building. The top-ranked team on the UCSB schedule, however, is Golden Coast Conference foe Pepperdine, who visit Campus Pool on Sept. 19. Just under a month later, on Oct. 6, the Gauchos will play host to USC, the defending national champions. The Trojans roughed up UC Santa Barbara in two separate games last season, so the early October clash will serve as a test of UCSB's mettle heading into the bulk of conference play. The Gauchos will take on each one of their conference foes after facing USC, beginning with the University of the Pacific on Oct. 19 and ending with Pepperdine, again, on Nov. 16. Pacific was the only non-top five team to beat UCSB last season, setting up the game at Campus Pool as another chance for UC Santa Barbara revenge.

sports,2019-20 Season Preview: Highly Lauded Men's Soccer Team Looks to Claim Big West Throne,22-Aug-19,8:27 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-highly-lauded-mens-soccer-team-looks-to-claim-big-west-throne/," Although last season ended in a heartbreaking fashion, the UCSB men's soccer team will be looking to build on the positive aspects of their run this past year as they begin their quest for the 2019-20 Big West title. The Gauchos finished the 2018-19 season in second place in the Big West with a 4-2-1 conference, 10-6-2 overall record. They both started and ended the season on a three-game win streak, yet close losses in the middle would come back to bite them as they ended just one game out of first place, and with a tough first-round matchup in the conference tournament against Cal State Fullerton. For the second year in a row, UCSB would go on to lose their first game of the tourney at home, this time a missed penalty kick away from advancing. Looking ahead, the Gauchos do have plenty to be optimistic about. One of the keys to success in any college sport is continuity, and the Gauchos are returning with a strong core including players such as senior defender Faouzi Taieb, senior midfielder Thibault Candia, and junior forward Rodney Michael.† Taieb has been a key component in the Gauchos' defensive and offensive gameplans ever since he transferred from St. Francis Brooklyn a year ago.† He tallied the most minutes on the team last year with 1642, and started every match he played. The French defender plays such a huge role because of his ability to not just orchestrate the defense, but also because of his nose for the ball on set-pieces. Whether it be his game-winning tap-in last year against Gonzaga, or his header in UCSB's exhibition win over Westmont last weekend, Taieb's physical strength and knack for being in the right place at the right time makes him one of the most dangerous players on the field when it's time for a free kick. His production has made it possible for UCSB to almost depend on set-pieces as the primary form of goal-scoring however, which is an issue I'll get back to a little later on. Moving to the middle of the field, fellow transfer Candia has developed into one of the top playmakers in the entire conference.† Candia's seven assists led the Big West last year and he has the sole assist of this season for the Gauchos in their win against the Warriors. The Parisian midfielder has been a mastermind on offense for UCSB, earning a Big West Player of the Week award last season and notching a game-winning goal against UC Davis as well. He's usually all over the attacking third, mixing curled long balls with quick through passes that keep the defense on their feet. He is also the free-kick taker for the Gauchos, who as I mentioned before are one of if not the most lethal teams in the Big West. Lastly, star forward Michael has re-energized and added a new dimension to UCSB's offense. While his accolades (2018 All-Big West First Team, 2018 All-Far West Region Team, and 2017 Big West Freshman of the Year, to name a few) speak for themselves, you really don't understand just how quick and skilled Michael is until you see it with your own eyes. The junior commands a double team in almost every game, and still manages to burst through the backline and score, as evidenced by his team-leading 17 goals last season. The pressure he puts on defenses is unlike any other player in the conference, and he is the key piece that makes this team run. These three players are certainly invaluable to the Gauchos, but they're not the only big names on the team. Reigning Co-Big West Freshman of the Year Ben Roach, who is a wall of a goalkeeper; senior defender Noah Billingsley, who anchors the defense; and senior forward Sahid Conteh, who both playmakes and finishes at an elite level are just a few examples of other players who will be essential to success in the upcoming season. As a team, the Gauchos will have to get over some of the hurdles that haunted them all of last season. As mentioned earlier, UCSB's overreliance on set-pieces to produce goals extremely limited their goal-scoring ability. Far too often last year the team would get out into transition, or string together nice passes in the midfield for it to just fizzle out as they reached the attacking third. They lost four games by the score of 1-0 last season, which is unacceptable when putting out the amount of offensive talent that they do on the field. It also cheapens the impact of the amazing defense and goalkeeping that they consistently play night in and night out, and allows teams to stick around that they should beat handily. UCSB will also have to make sure to maintain their composure as the season goes on. They received five yellow cards and a red already in their exhibition match against Westmont, and they just can't afford to shoot themselves in the foot because of their temper. Finding that middle ground between playing with passion and losing control can be difficult, but the Gauchos will need to keep it cool in order to get far. This next stretch of non-conference games, including matchups against big teams such as Virginia Tech, UC Berkeley and Gonzaga, will give UCSB a good opportunity to get back into playing shape and get some positive momentum going into the conference season. Once Big West play starts, the two Blue-Green Rivalry games against Cal Poly, which they play at Harder Stadium on Oct. 5 and Alex G. Spanos Stadium on Nov. 2, will of course be must-watch television. There is always no love lost between these two squads and they typically bring out the best in each other. Another game to circle on your calendar will be the Gauchos' matchup with UC Irvine at home on Oct. 19. The reigning Big West Champion Anteaters are the only team in the conference to be voted into the Top 25 by the United Soccer Coaches Preseason Poll, and will give UCSB a great opportunity to measure themselves against some of the top talent in the country.

sports,2019-20 Season Preview: Well-Balanced Women's Soccer Team Aims Sights on the Big West Title,22-Aug-19,6:43 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-well-balanced-womens-soccer-team-aims-sights-on-the-big-west-title/," The time has finally come for the UCSB women's soccer team to begin their quest for a Big West Title. After a successful season last year in which the Gauchos finished with an overall record of 13-7-1, Head Coach Paul Stumpf will look to increase his team's win total with an extremely well-rounded squad. UCSB got off to a quick start last year as they began the season on a five-game win streak. Of those five matchups, the ""òChos were able to keep a clean sheet in three of them. This was a major trend throughout last season as the Gauchos did not give up more than three goals in any game. Much of this success can be attributed to senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese, who came off the bench against Cal early in the season to help lead Santa Barbara to the win. Gaucho fans can expect DeWeese to be a force in front of the goal who will make her opponents earn their goals. After finishing last year with 60 saves and a save percentage of 80%, there is a lot of excitement around her potential for this upcoming season. On the offensive side of the ball, UCSB will be led by senior forward Shaelan Murison, who was recently named to the Big West preseason All-Conference Team. Murison was fantastic last year as she finished with 10 goals and four assists. In order for Santa Barbara to improve offensively, it will be crucial for Murison to not only provide veteran leadership but also create opportunities for her teammates as well. Although Murison will be key to the offensive attack, she will surely be double-teamed which means that her teammates must step up as well. Senior forward Katherine Sheehy seems to be a player that could potentially have a breakout year and help ease the pressure off of Murison. Sheehy is a playmaker and will look to push the ball with pace on the counter attack to catch opponents in a poor position defensively. For UCSB to compete for the Big West Title, the squad will need to have more of a balanced attack on the offensive side of the field. Last season, Murison had a total of a 100 shots with her next closest teammate coming in with only 19 shots. For Santa Barbara to have a chance to compete against the top teams in the country, other players must step up as opposing teams will place all their attention on Murison. That being said, there is strong optimism within the program that players like Sheehy will provide production offensively to make the team even more dynamic. With respect to this year's schedule, there is one matchup in particular that Gaucho fans should be excited about, which is a home game against the California Golden Bears on Aug. 30. In last year's contest, UCSB won in a thriller by a score of 3-2 behind strong play from DeWeese. Cal will surely be out for revenge in this game, making it a very intriguing matchup. Santa Barbara has already started this season strong in terms of exhibition games as they beat Westmont by a score of 2-0. Murison was able to break through in the 26th minute and junior midfielder Angelica Ortega added on with a goal in the 40th minute. With this game in control fairly early, UCSB was able to play more of their younger players to get them real game experience, which could prove to be important later down the road. The Gauchos will look to keep up their winning ways against Minnesota this upcoming Thursday at home in Harder Stadium at 7 p.m.

sports,2019-20 Season Preview: Women's Volleyball Team Hoping to Turn Individual Accolades Into Team Success,22-Aug-19,8:39 PM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-22/2019-20-season-preview-womens-volleyball-team-hoping-to-turn-individual-accolades-into-team-success/,"Olivia Lovenburg sets for Zoe Fleck. Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Volleyball season is just around the corner as the Gauchos get set for their first games of the season this weekend. UCSB will be looking for its first Big West title since 2013 and will be hoping to build off of their improvement in the previous season.. The Gauchos finished 2018 with an overall record of 17-12 and a conference record of 9-7 helped in part by the surprising play of freshman setter Olivia Lovenberg, who led the league in assists per set while also posting four double-doubles with assists and digs in her first six career games. After a rocky 2-3 start to the season, the Gauchos quickly turned it around, rattling off 10 wins in their next 13 games and earning them a 12-6 record a little over halfway through the season. With Lovenberg leading the Big West in assists per set at 11.21, star senior Lindsey Ruddins and now-graduated Emilia Petrachi played significant roles in the turnaround as well. Ruddins led the Big West in total kills and kills per set at 587 and 5.34 respectively, while Petrachi found herself at the top in both digs and digs per set at 555 and 4.96 in her senior year. The story here is that the 2018-19 Gauchos were able to rebound after a tough 2017-18 season which saw a measly 8-20 record overall and a 7-9 record in conference play. The rebound was a team effort that featured top-level contributions from a variety of positions and experience levels. The Gauchos were ultimately invited to the National Invitational Volleyball Championship after finishing 9-7 in league play and winning their last three games, including two back-to-back sweeps. UCSB's 9-7 league record was their best since the 2013 season and they will be looking to improve as they begin the 2019-20 season this weekend. It should be an uphill battle though, as conference rivals Cal Poly, Hawai'i and UC Irvine finished last season with conference records of 15-1, 14-2 and 10-6 respectively. An eleven-game stretch near the start of the season features one matchup with Irvine and two with Hawai'i, as well as two Blue-Green rivalries. That means five of those eleven games will be against last year's top three conference teams including UCSB's archrival. This stretch also features two matchups with UC Davis and two with Long Beach State, the two schools who finished just below UCSB in the Big West standings. UCSB split the two-game series with both schools last year. This stretch will almost guarantee UCSB's position as an elite club or expose the team as a one-season wonder. The Gauchos will have to be especially careful not to let their emotions get the best of them in the games against Cal Poly, as the Mustangs' defense was frustrating to play against last year and their offense was efficient. Cal Poly's Torrey Van Winden led the Big West in hitting percentage at .365 while teammate Meredith Phillips was ranked fourth with a .328. The Big West's leader in blocks per set was also led by Mustang Madilyn Mercer who posted a 1.12. Not a single Gaucho was in the top five of either category. Cal Poly's stingy defense and crazy efficient offense catapulted them to a 15-1 conference record and a 25-3 overall. Individual efforts were the premier highlights for the Gauchos in 2018-19, and they will be looking to put it all together into team success this season. The Blue-Green matchup will showcase some of the league's best talents as well the Big West's fiercest rivalry. Each game will be a must-watch. The Gauchos begin the season on Friday, Aug. 23 with a home scrimmage against CSU Bakersfield. Regular season play begins on Friday, Aug. 30 when UCSB travels to Boulder to take on Long Island University in the Colorado Tournament.

sports,Gauchos Tie With Golden Gophers in Double Overtime Thriller,23-Aug-19,2:21 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-23/gauchos-tie-with-golden-gophers-in-double-overtime-thriller/,"Daily Nexus File Photo The UCSB women's soccer team officially began their regular season with a draw in a thrilling double overtime match against Minnesota. While it may not have been the result the Gauchos were looking for, there were many positives to take away from the game, including the team's resiliency despite being down a goal. Santa Barbara started the game off strong as senior forward Shaelan Murison found the back of the net two minutes into the game. Murison continues to be a nightmare for opposing teams as she is constantly putting pressure on goal. This not only forces teams to play more defensive but also allows UCSB to play more freely in the midfield area. Although it is early, one thing that has been noticeable is the aggressive press that the Gauchos have played with. By constantly pressuring the ball, it makes it more likely for their opponents to turn the ball over, especially in their own half of the field. After the first ten minutes being dominated by Santa Barbara, Minnesota began to find their rhythm behind strong play from junior forward Makenzie Langdok. Langdok had her first shot blocked in the 19th minute but was able to put away a goal in the 18th minute to the level the matchup at 1-1. Despite a quick start, UCSB was unable to keep their momentum primarily because they were constantly being called for fouls. This ended up stagnating their counterattack and allowing Minnesota to increase their time of possession. Langdok took advantage and scored her second goal of the match in the 57th minute behind a lazy pass in the back end by the ""òChos. Minnesota had seemingly taken full control of the game at this point and shifted toward a defensive formation. UCSB responded by putting constant pressure on the Golden Gopher's goalkeeper Maddie Nielsen. Nielsen successfully blocked two Gaucho attempts but was unsuccessful in the 83rd minute as sophomore forward Jessica Wright pushed the ball through to knot things up. Neither team would be able to create many chances following this goal in either overtime, leading to the final score of 2-2. It was an encouraging sight for Head Coach Paul Stumpf as it is clear that this squad not only competes at a high level but also has the maturity to not panic when things are not going their way. There were a couple instances where this was clear but one in particular was when the ""òChos were constantly being called for fouls throughout the first half. Rather than allow this to take themselves out of the game mentally, Santa Barbara was able to keep their composure, a characteristic that will be necessary to maintain for UCSB to make a run for the Big West Title. Next up for UCSB will be a matchup against San Jose State, who are also coming off of a draw against Cal Poly. The Spartans are led by Jamilecxth Becerra who finished last season with a team-leading five goals. For the Gauchos to have success in this matchup, it will be important that the defense shadows Becerra as she is extremely dangerous in the penalty box area. In front of goal for the Spartans is sophomore Ariana Romero who recently transferred from Seattle University. In her first start for SJSU, Romero had an impressive three saves which helped lead to a clean sheet. UCSB will need to constantly put pressure on goal in their upcoming matchup to take Romero out of her comfort zone. Santa Barbara will look to get their first win of the season at home this Sunday against SJSU at 12 p.m. inside Harder Stadium.†

sports,UCSB Victory over LMU Marks End of Preseason,25-Aug-19,4:16 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-08-25/ucsb-victory-over-lmu-marks-end-of-preseason/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus UCSB faced LMU Saturday night for their second, and final, preseason exhibition match of the new season. Ultimately, the victory went to the away side as a Gaucho set piece halfway through the first half granted them the go-ahead goal in a 1-0 win over the visiting Lions. The game against the Lions also featured a couple of new faces for the Gauchos, as senior forward Will Baynham and junior forward Ameyawu Muntari made their debuts as starters for the Blue and Gold. Baynham is from Brisbane, Australia, and joined UCSB this season from Arizona's Yavapai College. Muntari is Ghanaian and has previously played his soccer here locally as he joins the Gauchos from Santa Barbara City College. The match began fairly even with both sides playing with intensity as they fought for possession. UCSB's first attack came after twelve minutes as 6'5""ù defender Hunter Ashworth delivered a shot at goal following a corner kick.† Soon after, junior forward Rodney Michael kept the pressure on for the Gauchos as he also took a shot that sailed just left of the goal. Minutes later, LMU responded as freshman midfielder for the Lions, Noel Caliskan, returned a shot at goal. The visiting team's bright spot had to be their play at the middle of the pitch, as Caliskan's midfielding partner, sophomore CJ Neville, had to be fouled twice consecutively by the Gauchos within a span of three minutes. Then, at the 21-minute mark, UCSB capitalized on an awarded free kick as senior defender and New Zealand international Noah Billingsley netted a brilliant strike that bested the opposing keeper and brought the hosts up to a 1-0 lead in the first half of regulation. Following this, the Gauchos' confidence in their play seemed to increase as an accurate strike by Baynham demanded a save from LMU's junior goalkeeper Alfredo Cortez. The Gauchos' first and only booking of the match went to Ashworth following a foul in the 32nd minute. A couple of off-target shots from the Lions then closed out all the action as the halftime whistle closed out the first. Considering the match's significance as a preseason exhibition, both teams' head coaches called for several substitutions, prior and throughout the start of the second half of play, in order to see what their depth players had to offer. To start things off in the second half, Michael tested the new keeper on goal, LMU sophomore Jacob Jackson, with a ball to the top right that required a save. Although both teams shared possession, UCSB dominated the majority of attacks as Michael's shot was followed by five more strikes from the Gauchos. In the end, the home side's offense couldn't score another but the defense came to play that night as the Lions were held to only one strike in the entire second half of play; Gaucho goalkeepers were hardly tested at all as none of LMU's shots were on-target. UCSB had earned the 1-0 victory to close out a solid preseason with high expectations following them into the start of the regular season. In addition, UCSB just recently became the projected favorites to win the Big West Conference for the new men's soccer season. The Gauchos are set to kick off this year's regular season next Friday, August 30, as UCSB hosts UNLV with a 7:30 p.m. kickoff time. Correction [8/26]: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the Gauchos hosted the Lions in this exhibition matchup. The game was played at Sullivan Field in Los Angeles.

In Sunday's game, the ""òChos could not find the back of the net and ended up in a 0-0 draw against San Jose State at Harder Stadium. With this result, UCSB moves to 0-0-2 on the season and is still searching for its first win. The Spartans' start to the season has been similar to the Gauchos, as they tied 0-0 in their first regular season game against Cal Poly last Thursday. San Jose State has high expectations for this season after being picked to finish second in the Mountain West Conference Preseason Poll. They will be looking to build off of the successes of 2018 by repeating as conference champions and making the NCAA tournament for the second year in a row. SJSU is an elite team mainly due to their excellent crew of defensive stoppers who man the backline, and they showed it by not allowing the Gauchos to find the net. Last season the Spartans had one of the best defenses in the country, lead by now-senior Kristen Amarikwa, a 2018 All-Mountain West First Team selection. Her teammates Jada Wilson and Natasha Harris were selected to the All-Conference and All-MWC Tournament teams respectively last season, and they're back to hold down the fort defensively.† Sunday's game saw the Gauchos get off to a solid start that left them with nothing to show for it. During the first 31 minutes of action, UCSB managed four shots and limited the Spartans to zero attempts of their own. Angelica Ortega and Shaelan Murison both got decent looks, but Spartans keeper Ariana Romero came up with the save both times. Aside from the few shots from both teams, the first half set the gritty tone of this game with lots of physical play and a heft number of fouls called as both teams combined for 11 of the game's 33 total fouls in the first 45 minutes of action. In the second half, Santa Barbara continued to get solid looks to score but again it was keeper Romero with another pair of saves in the first 18 minutes of the second half. SJSU did not get many great looks all game until the 81st minute, when the Spartans' Darrian Reed and Natalia Nava got a couple of shots on goal within a two-minute span that were both saved by Gauchos keeper Hanna DeWeese. Each team had one more shot to win in regulation as shots by Murison of UCSB and Alison Gallant of SJSU were saved in the final minutes and the match went to overtime.† Neither team scored in overtime even though the Gauchos kept the pressure on and managed six unsuccessful shots in twenty minutes before the game was called.† This marathon overtime game gives the Gauchos a 0-0-2 record, and they will look to get their first win of the season at 5:00 p.m. on Friday when they return to Harder Stadium to face the Cal Golden Bears.

Starting with this matchup against the Rebels, all regular season games will begin to count toward each teams' overall record; the Gauchos will face a total of 11 regular season opponents before their first conference matchup versus Sac State on Oct. 9.† The Gauchos enter their new campaign after coming off a 10-6-2 overall record the previous season, as well as a most recent 2-0 preseason record which included clean sheets in both bouts. With the greater expectations considering they are the early favorites in the Big West Conference, the team is poised for an excellent year that'll hopefully carry them deep into the postseason.† In addition, UCSB's home venue will surely be an added boost as Harder Stadium proved to be a fortress last year. The Gauchos went undefeated when playing at home last season, finishing with a 9-0-1 overall, an impressive feat, but the team will only begin to reach their full potential once it can clean up its away record.† As for UNLV, their 2018 campaign finished right at the .500 win percentage mark and a first-round WAC Tournament exit during the postseason. Having won more away games than at home, the Rebels' overall record of 10-10-1 shows they'll be a formidable foe that's worthy of kicking off the Gauchos' new season at Harder Stadium.† Historically, UNLV has the edge in this one as UCSB trails in the all-time series with a record of 11-16-4. The last time these two sides faced off came in a regular season confrontation, back in 2004, where the Gauchos also hosted and proved to be too much as they bested the visitors by a score of 4-0.† With the 2019 UCSB men's soccer roster all ready to go, it'll be interesting to see who will make Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg's starting 11 for Friday's opener. The battle for playtime on the defensive side of the ball will be a difficult one as players like junior Hunter Ashworth and seniors Noah Billingsley and Faouzi Taieb have proven that in order to see the field you'll have to get the ball in the opposing net as much as you defend your own; together, the trio of defenders have combined for an impressive total of 10 goals and 9 assists across their career stats.† Similarly, we'll be eager to see how the offense lines up as Vom Steeg will have a number of playmakers and goalscorers to choose from. The attacking newcomers in junior forward Ameyawu Muntari and senior forward Will Baynham, will also be thrown into the mix after making the most of their preseason debuts.† On the visitor's end, the danger man for UNLV appears to be junior midfielder Marco Gonzalez, who finished with 10 goals and three assists last year for the Rebels. Gonzalez's goal-poaching threat will also be accompanied by sophomore midfielder Nico Clasen's playmaking ability, as Clasen had a team-leading 10 assists to his name in 2018.† There'll be plenty of positional battles all night and we'll see if Harder Stadium can still continue to be a fortress as we enter a new season of men's soccer.† UCSB hosts UNLV this Friday, August 30, with kickoff time set for 7:30 p.m.†

Even before playing a single game the Gauchos face an immense amount of pressure to play up to the expectations league-wide. The team has lost one of its premier players Emilia Petrachi who is a vocal veteran leader. It's even more imperative now more than ever that the ""òChos get out to a good start and don't fall behind early and play catch-up like last season. Without the consistent leadership presence of a veteran like Petrachi the team needs less-featured players to take the next step and fill the void if they want any chance to come close to their expectations.† This weekend, look for sophomore Gigi Ruddins and her older sister senior Lindsey Ruddins to make a statement. Lindsey is as decorated as any player in the league ""ì boasting a three-time AVCA All-American Honorable Mention selection and putting up an outworldly 5.34 k/s which ranks her as the second-most efficient outside in the country. Gigi will be looking to take that next step as she fills the role Petrachi played. After putting up an impressive freshman season (All-Big West Freshman Team) the ""òChos desperately need her to post another stellar season for them to reach anywhere close to their potential.† The main weakness for this Gaucho team at the moment seems to be their blocking with their lineups featuring an undersized setter, Olivia Lovenberg, who is 5'8""ù. Her efficiency on offense negates this as she leads the conference in assists and became the second player to reach 1000 assists. Expect games this season to become Big 12 football-style shootouts, as Lovenberg airs out sets to premier hitters. With such a star-studded offensive unit we would also be remiss if we did not mention middle Rowan Ennis. With the elite Ruddins sisters playing outside and a facilitator like Lovenberg, expect Ennis to put up big numbers as well, especially considering the amount of defensive pressure Lindsey absorbs on her own.† The Long Island University team the ""òChos will play against has a roster with a very high upside. Outside of their blocking, the LIU team runs a high octane offense run by setter Amanda Hubbard. In order for the Guachos to win tomorrow look for them to use their high tempo offense to beat out the LIU blockers to generate long point streaks and keeping the LIU team from getting in system. Where ""úin system""ù refers to being capable of setting the middle in a given play. Without being able to set the middle, the opposing blocking middle has an easier time cheating to either end to put up a block ""ì which greatly improves the outcome for the defending team. With a team this young there are a lot of x factors, but the biggest one will most likely be Ennis. If she can take her offensive efficiency up a notch and continue to be an unstoppable force on defense, the sky's the limit for this group of ""òChos.†

sports,UCSB Women's Soccer Shut Out by Golden Bears,1-Sep-19,4:29 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-01/ucsb-womens-soccer-shut-out-by-golden-bears/,"Christine Maurer dives to intercept a pass. Stephen Manga/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team was unable to grab their first win of the season this past Friday against Cal as they lost by a score of 2-0. With only one shot on goal, Santa Barbara was unable to establish any kind of rhythm, leading to a comfortable win for the Golden Bears. 

Cal was last in action against Weber State where the Bears dominated and won by a score of 5-0. Junior midfielder Luca Deza was able to find the back of the net twice against the Wildcats. Although it was only the first game of the season, it was very clear that Cal's roster is filled with talented players across the board and that the Gauchos would have to be on top of their game in order to upset the Bears. 

Throughout the first half, both teams struggled to find opportunities on the offensive end. Much of this can be attributed to the stout defense on both sides, particularly the on-ball pressure in the midfield area. That being said, Santa Barbara had their chances as they had five corners in the first half but were unable to execute in the final third of the field. 

After a scoreless first half, Cal would finally convert a goal three minutes into the second half after a header from redshirt sophomore Denae Antoine that was able to just get past the outstretched arm of UCSB's senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. It was a momentary lapse in concentration by the ""òChos defense as they let Antoine find space in the penalty box where she was able to redirect the ball into the back of the net. 

Twenty minutes later, the Bears would get their second goal of the night as junior forward Emma Westin converted a cross to put Cal up by two goals, essentially putting the game out of reach. 

It was a struggle throughout the entire game for Santa Barbara on offense as UCSB struggled to put pressure on Cal's freshman goalkeeper Angelina Anderson. Anderson only had to save one shot on goal as the rest of the Gauchos' seven shots were off the mark.

In order for Santa Barbara to get their first win of the season in the next week, it will be important for them to develop an identity on the offensive side of the field. While the squad is very effective on the defensive side of the field, they will not be able to win most of their games without finding the back of the net multiple times in a given game. 

Senior forward Shaelan Murison will be one of the key players regarding whether UCSB will be able to find consistency on the offensive end. As the team's leading goal scorer from a year ago, there is a lot of responsibility that has been put on her shoulders as the team looks to take the next step towards a Big West Championship. Even though Murison is an important piece, her teammates must also find a way to make an impact as well as opposing teams will surely double team her inside of the box. 

One positive takeaway from this matchup was the play of DeWeese as she had a total of five saves. DeWeese has proven to be extremely consistent in front of the net and has cemented her role as a leader for the team as well.

Santa Barbara will look to pick up their first win of the season as the ""òChos are back in action next Friday in their first away game of the season against Montana at 4:00 p.m.

sports,Gauchos Claim First Victory and Suffer First Loss in Challenging Weekend,2-Sep-19,6:19 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-02/gauchos-claim-first-victory-and-suffer-first-loss-in-challenging-weekend/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's soccer team had a roller coaster of a weekend as they outlasted the UNLV Rebels for their first win of the year on Friday night, and only 48 hours later took their first loss of the season against the No.16 Virginia Tech Hokies. The Gauchos are now 1-1 on the season, the Rebels sit at 0-1 and the Hokies end their West Coast road trip at 2-0. The Friday night matchup against UNLV was a battle of attrition for the Gauchos, and although they ended up with the 2-1 win in double overtime, they suffered some big injuries that will certainly impact the team these next couple weeks. Freshman defender Lucas Gonzalez got the first start of his career at left-back after playing great in both of the exhibition games prior to Friday. The LA Galaxy product is a promising prospect for UCSB, giving the team some speed and goalscoring ability in the backline. He started off playing great against the Rebels however in the 8th minute he contested a ball in the air and awkwardly landed on his ankle when he came down. This took him out of the game, and could hold him out for an extended period of time. His injury sucked the life out of the Gauchos early in the game, but their defense held strong for most of the first half. The Rebels had their best goalscoring opportunity in the 44th minute when junior midfielder Marcos Gonzalez rocketed a shot off the post, and the Gauchos actually went into halftime leading 55-45 in possession even though they hadn't played their best soccer yet. UCSB came running out of the gates for the second half, and in the 47th minute looked to have their first goal of the regular season when forward Rodney Michael sent a perfect chip to a wide-open Thibault Candia in the box. Candia was one-on-one with goalkeeper Enrique Adame, yet the midfielder whiffed on the volley leading to an easy save. The inability to convert in the final third was a concerning theme for the Gauchos for the first 87 minutes. There were three plays in the first ten minutes of the second half alone where UCSB had the ball in the box with a clean look that they couldn't put in the back of the net, and although chemistry and sharpness will surely improve as the season goes on, the team really can't afford to keep missing opportunities if they want to win. The second major roadblock for the Gauchos came in the 54th minute when senior defender Faouzi Taieb left the game with an apparent hamstring injury. Taieb is a key player both on offense and defense for UCSB, and with him out for the next few games the team will have to put that much more effort in on both ends to keep things running smoothly. As the game wore on and injuries piled up for the Gauchos there was a huge momentum swing in favor of the Rebels. Starting in the 63rd minute UNLV had an almost 20-minute stretch of straight up pressure on the UCSB defense, until the 80th minute when freshman Hayden Prasad curled in a cross which forward Bryan Martinez-Serrano headed home. The goal was a wake-up call for the Gauchos, and they turned on the jets themselves, eventually leading to an Ignacio Tellechea strike in the 87th minute past the Rebels goalkeeper's outstretched arms to send the game into overtime. UCSB almost put the game away in the first four minutes of OT when junior transfer Ameyawu Muntari was brought down in the box, however Michael sent the penalty kick that they were awarded soaring over the bar. Finally with just three minutes left in the second overtime period, forward Will Baynham got to play hero for the Gauchos when he knocked in a loose ball in the box to give them the 2-1 victory. It was a quick 48 hour turn-around for the Gauchos as they had to face off against a tough Virginia Tech team on Sunday night. UCSB struck first in this game in the 4th minute when Muntari took the ball down the left wing and sent a cross in that took a slight deflection off of a Hokie defender and found the back of the net. The Ghanian transfer from Santa Barbara City College has been a pleasant surprise early on this season, using his speed and technical ability with both feet to create a ton of opportunities on offense. It was all downhill from there for the Gauchos however, as Virginia Tech would go on to score three unanswered goals to win the game 3-1. Senior Jon Ingason would be the one to open up the scoring for the Hokies in the 7th minute as he struck a free kick from 25 yards out into the upper right corner of the goal. The second goal would come in the 65th minute when senior forward James Kasak, who just terrorized the depleted Gauchos backline all game long, crossed the ball into the box and UCSB defender Hunter Ashworth's attempted clearance rocketed into the back of the net for an own goal. While the last goal for the Hokies in the 74th minute, a tap-in by forward Jacob Labovitz after a Ben Roach free-kick save, essentially put the game out of reach, the setup to the free kick actually had larger implications.† Virginia Tech was awarded a free kick only because of a frustration foul by Ashworth after a verbal altercation with Hokie forward Brendan Moyers. The Gauchos have struggled with keeping a lid on their tempers before, but they really can't afford to give up set-pieces and fouls out of anger, especially with Taieb out for the foreseeable future. Although they let their emotions get the best of them on Sunday night, UCSB will look to get back on track this Saturday when they take on UC Berkeley at Harder Stadium.

Nexus File Photo UCSB finished opening weekend with a 2-1 record after sweeping Long Island University Brooklyn just before taking one of two on the final day of the tournament. Colorado hosted the Buffs Invitational this past weekend, and the Gauchos got off to a strong start Friday afternoon as they swept LIU Brooklyn 3-0 (25-17, 25-17, 25-20). Lindsey Ruddins was at her best again with a team-high 15 kills on 30 attempts. Right behind her was Tallulah Froley, Deni Wilson and Kjia Rivers with nine, seven and six kills respectively. It was a team game for the Gauchos as Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch's squad featured five players with three or more kills while LIU only had Kora Schaberl, 16, and Jovana Stekovic, nine. While Schaberl did lead both teams in kills, she also led both teams in errors at seven and LIU also posted eight more errors overall than the Gauchos. The Gauchos were evidently the better team and perhaps no stat reflects this as well as each team's hitting percentage. The Gauchos rattled off a .318 (40-12-88) clip while also holding the Sharks to a .133 (34-21-98) on the day. Hanging on the edge of a 2-1 set deficit to Wyoming on Saturday morning, UCSB held onto two tight leads to win the match 3-2 (25-21, 20-25, 26-28, 25-16, 15-11). They came out strong in the fourth set after a heartbreaking third. Ruddins post a trio of kills to bring the score to 7-3 and the Gauchos would eventually hold on. The fifth set was back and forth, but clutch plays by Wilson, Ruddins and Rowan Ennis would prove to be the deciding moments of the set and match. It shouldn't be too hard to appreciate the depth that this team has. Contributors from all over the court were once again shining. Wilson followed up her nine-kill debut on Friday with a new career-high 11-kill performance. She added four blocks too while Ennis led the team with eight. Ennis was not afraid of scoring either and had eight kills herself. Zoe Fleck and Torre Glasker put on defensive masterclasses as they posted 28 and 21 digs respectively while Ruddins added 16 for the double-double. As for the helpers, Olivia Lovenberg's 27 and Romoni Vivao's 24 assists were the result of a very solid pair holding the setting duties for Welch's squad. Froley and Rivers added seven kills each and the Gauchos were just rolling. Ruddins was once again the story as she moved into second all-time in UCSB history in career kills. She entered the day just one kill behind Kristie Ryan (1989-92), but posted 21 to bring her career total to 1,567. Roberta Gehlke's (1996-99) 2,153 are most in Gaucho history. UCSB fell to host Colorado in the second of two Saturday games 1-3 (16-25, 19-25, 25-22, 21-25). Two long runs (10-3 in the first set, 8-1 in the last) by Colorado gave them the edge in what was a fierce showdown between two very deep squads. †Ruddins was once again at the top of her team in kills with 19, but Ennis, Froley, Wilson and Tasia Farmer all tallied seven apiece. More impressive was Vivao's 17-assist, 11-dig double-double that also included seven blocks. A tough and deep Gaucho squad was defeated thanks to an inferior hitting percentage and dig count. Colorado was able to outhit the Gauchos .227 (50-21-128) to .144 (51-30-146) while also finishing with 10 more blocks at 58-48. While the weekend proved that UCSB is more than capable of standing their ground, kill efficiency was the reason they lost this game and almost lost to Wyoming. If the Gauchos are to have sustained success, they must add efficiency to their already deep and versatile squad. The Gauchos will look to take on NC State this Friday, Sept. 6 at 11:30 a.m. to open the VCU Invitational.

sports,Gauchos Head North Searching for First Win of the Season,5-Sep-19,7:52 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-05/gauchos-head-north-searching-for-first-win-of-the-season/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team will hit the road for the first time this weekend and travel north to face the Montana Grizzlies on Friday and the Idaho Vandals on Sunday. In all-time matchups, Santa Barbara is 2-0-0 against Montana and 6-1-1 against Idaho, so they have fared well against these teams in the past. The Gauchos are still searching for their first win of the season as their loss to Cal last week dropped their overall record to 0-1-2.† The ""òChos' next opponent is also still aiming to get into the win column, as Montana has lost their last two games after draws in their first two, bringing their record to 0-2-2. Friday's game will be Grizzlies' first back at their home stadium in Missoula, which should surely give them a boost.† Montana has high expectations this season after being picked to finish third in the Big Sky. They return a pair of Honorable Mention All-Conference performers in junior goalkeeper Claire Howard and junior midfielder Kennedy Yost. Howard enjoyed a stellar sophomore campaign in 2018 that landed her on the Big Sky All-Tournament team in addition to her success in the regular season. She recorded 10 shutouts including three consecutive shutouts against higher-ranking opponents in the conference tournament to punch the Grizzlies' ticket to the NCAA tournament. Yost started all 22 matches a season ago for the Grizzlies, scoring five goals on 45 shots. She has yet to put the ball in the net this season and she'll definitely be looking to get off the schneid against UCSB.†† The Gauchos must look to attack offensively and limit the impact of these two key players for Montana if they want to leave Missoula with a victory. UCSB's second game of the weekend will be played on Sunday in Moscow, Idaho against the 2-2 Idaho Vandals.† Idaho is also a member of the Big Sky, and this season they have enjoyed wins over both CSU Bakersfield and Oregon Tech, and they also suffered one-score losses against Boise State and Mississippi State. The Vandals finished 9-7-3 a season ago and missed the NCAA tournament, and experts expect them to be a solid team this year because they were picked to finish fourth, behind Montana, in the Big Sky preseason polls.† Idaho returns two All-Conference members from a season ago: first-teamer senior forward Myah Merino as well as second-teamer junior midfielder Hadley Sbrega. The two both appeared in all 19 games for the Vandals, and combined to score six goals and tallied 14 points over the course of the season. Over the first four games of this season Merino recorded one assist along with one goal in their last contest against Mississippi State. So far this season it has been sophomore Maddie Haas who has jumped out for Idaho, who, after not scoring a goal in 16 games during her freshman year, has two goals and one assist in the Vandals' first four games to start 2019.† With Idaho being the Gauchos' second quality opponent in three days, Sunday's match is sure to be a battle of stamina and serve as a good early-season test for a team still trying to find its way. UCSB has struggled mightily with scoring the ball over the past two games and it is possible that too much of the offensive responsibility is currently falling on the shoulders of their star Shaelan Murison. Murison has attempted 17 shots in the Gauchos' first three games, 12 more than Jessica Wright and Cate Post, who are tied for second on the team in shots taken. So far, Cal has been the only opponent who has outshot the Gauchos in a game, but the large amount of shots taken have yet to translate to goals scored for the Blue and Gold. It will be interesting to see what adjustments Head Coach Paul Stumpf and his staff decide to make heading into this road trip to try and maximize the offensive production.

The three-day slate of games begins this Friday as the team takes on Concordia Irvine. The Gauchos' opponent in their succeeding games will be determined based off of Friday's first match.† Concordia is coming into 2019 with a fresh mindset after finishing their 2018 campaign with a 5-19 record. On the other side of the pool, the Gauchos are coming into their season opener looking to start off on the right foot.  A new poll was recently released that ranked UCSB number one in the Gold Coast Conference, and number seven nationally. Several freshmen are competing collegiately for the first time this weekend, and seniors like Jacob Halle and Tommy Fellner will look to help take off some of the pressure that comes with learning a new system.† The Gaucho men's team begins their season each year by competing in this Triton Invitational, and for good reason.  Some of the universities that will be taking part in the invite include USC, UCLA, Long Beach State and UC Davis, several well-respected water polo programs who have been near the top of the national ranks for most of the past decade. UCSB will need to play smart and together if they want to win this stacked tournament. A strong showing this weekend could potentially propel the team into the top five when the next national ranks are released.

This will be the final matchup of a three-game homestand in which the Gauchos hosted UNLV and No. 10 Virginia Tech; the team will face a doubleheader on the road next week as they visit Gonzaga and Oregon State. UCSB enters this week of play looking to finish on the right side of .500 following their split in performances last week. First, they had a 2-1 victory against the UNLV Rebels which had to go to double overtime until a late golden goal by senior forward Will Baynham secured it for the home side. Then, the Gauchos suffered a 3-1 loss to a Virginia Tech side that has been climbing the national rankings as of late. Nevertheless, the Gauchos will want to get back on track and they'll seek to do so against a Cal team who stands at a .750 win percentage after winning their opener and drawing in their most recent game. Looking back at the record book, there is an added incentive for the Gauchos considering their last victory over Cal came all the way back in 2003 following a 2-0 postseason win in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. UCSB trails in the all-time series against Cal by a record of 11-18-3, and a win here will snap an ongoing four-game losing streak versus the Bears. Ones to watch for the Gauchos include a pair of senior strikers in Ignacio Tellechea and the aforementioned Baynham; both Tellechea and Baynham lead the team in scoring with a goal each to their name. In addition, midfielder Thibault Candia is responsible for supplying the threat as the senior playmaker has a team-leading 2 assists. Coming into this weekend's game a roster update is in order, as several key Gauchos may not be suiting up against Cal. Junior defender Hunter Ashworth and senior defender Noah Billingsley, who are both starters in Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg's squad, will be attending to international duties after being called up to the U-23 New Zealand team. UCSB has also sustained a couple of injuries with freshman defender Lucas Gonzalez and senior defender Faouzi Taieb both unable to finish the match versus UNLV. The Gauchos' backline will be tested considering these four potential absences on defense. As for Cal, they have a team-leading duo of their own in freshman midfielder Paolo Carrillo-Weisenburger and junior forward Tommy Williamson. Both also have a goal each on the season and will look to make a difference for their team playing on the road. It'll be an exciting Saturday night for soccer as the Gauchos will fight for another home win in hopes of bringing their regular season record to 2-1. It'll also be ""òGaucho Gives Elementary School Night', at the Thunderdome, with a youth t-shirts promo and post-game autographs.

Nicole Wallace/Daily Nexus The UCSB women's volleyball team finished 3-0 after having defeated North Carolina State (25-17, 25-23, 23-25, 25-22), Navy (25-15, 20-25, 25-23, 25-21) and host Virginia Commonwealth (25-23, 21-25, 21-25, 25-22, 15-13) at the VCU Invitational this past weekend. Lindsey Ruddins, Tallulah Froley, and Rowan Ennis each had over ten kills and led the Gauchos to a narrow victory over NC State, who has struggled since opening the season 6-1 in sets in their first two games. A 0-3 showing against VCU as well as 1-3 losses to UCSB and Alabama means NC State now sits at 2-3 overall while posting an 8-10 record in sets. Meanwhile, a clean sweep at VCU this weekend means UCSB is sitting at a comfortable 5-1. Ruddins has been the standout performer thus far, having posted 114 kills up to this point with at least 15 in each game. Aside from Aug. 30's LIU matchup, Ruddins has at least 18 kills in the last five games. Although NC State's Kaylee Frazier led both teams with 21 digs, it was the Gauchos who took the win in overall digs at 69-67. A slight edge in kills and a much better kill efficiency proved to be the deciding factors here, not to mention that NC State also had one more error. The Gauchos won the first two sets before NC State staved off the attack and managed to win the third 25-23. An eight-error set by the Wolfpack and a 0.294 kill percentage by the Gauchos meant it was game over. Much has been the same for the Gauchos this year and another superior showing in hitting percentage, blocks, digs and aces meant that Navy had little to no chance of coming back. After a season of individual success that often got in the way of complete team fluidity, the Gauchos have proven to be much improved as a whole. While Ruddins once again showed out with 20 kills, Olivia Lovenberg posted a double-double with a team-high 22 assists and 12 digs. Throw in 14 digs by Torre Glasker and 12 by Zoe Fleckand you don't even need freshman Romoni Vivao's 17-assist, seven-dig, four-service ace game to know that the Gauchos were dominant ""î though it certainly helped. ESPN+ viewers were treated quite well as the UCSB-VCU matchup provided the perfect platform for Ruddins to showcase her skills. She posted a 20-kill, 17-dig double-double en route to a 3-2 Gauchos victory. Unlike previous games where the Gauchos have won thanks to a superior hitting percentage, VCU had the upper hand with a 0.184 versus UCSB's 0.15. An edge in digs and aces meant UCSB just had to prevent VCU from going on any big runs and they could come back. And they did just that. UCSB won the first set 25-23 before narrowly losing the next two 21-25. The Gauchos won the third set 25-22 before holding VCU to 13 points in the final set. UCSB finished the match with four double-figures in digs, by Ruddins, Glasker, Fleck (who had a team-high 22) and Vivao. Don't forget UCSB's slight edge in blocks and the Gauchos' stout defense gave them the win and the weekend sweep. UCSB (5-1) returns for its home opener this Friday, Sept. 13 at 6 p.m. against the University of San Diego as it hosts the Thunderdome Classic.

With the loss the Gauchos now sport a 1-2 overall record while UC Berkeley remains undefeated with a 2-0-1 record. There were plenty of questions surrounding UCSB's defense coming into this matchup given the fact that all four members of the team's backline are either injured or playing for their international squad.† Cal answered them pretty quickly. The Golden Bears found the back of the net only 45 seconds into the match when redshirt sophomore forward Alonzo Del Mundo took the ball down the left wing and floated a cross into the box which dropped right in front of senior forward Simon Lekressner, who banged a shot into the upper right corner of the goal. UCSB's† back four really struggled to start off the game, especially with crosses coming in from the left wing. Although there were some experienced defenders out on the pitch, like junior defenders Kavian Kashani and William Gillingham, the lack of synchronicity and chemistry that only comes with playing together for extended periods of time made it too easy for the deadly Berkeley offense.† Del Mundo in particular just punished the Gauchos on the left side of the field. In the 14th minute he took the ball down the left wing again and sent a hard cross on the ground which was hammered home by freshman forward Arman Samimi, doubling the Golden Bears' lead. The Richmond native ended† the first half with a whopping three assists after his corner kick was headed in by junior forward Tommy Williamson in the 33rd minute. While the defensive woes for the Gauchos at least can be partially excused by some key absences, the larger and more alarming issue for the team at the moment has been their inability to deliver on offense. On paper there didn't seem to be too much of a discrepancy between the two squads: UCSB took nine shots with five on target compared to UCB's 13 shots with six on goal, but the results (and the eye test) show that many of the offensive woes from the past year have followed the team into the new season. The issue hasn't really been producing opportunities, but rather it's been capitalizing on them when they appear. Senior forward Will Baynham tried to jumpstart the Gaucho offense to kick off the second half, sending in a strike that was easily corralled by Cal senior goalkeeper Drake Callender in the 47th minute. That would be UCSB's last shot until the 87th minute, however, when the game was already far out of reach. Baynham has been one of the few silver linings for the Gauchos on offense so far this season, using his big frame and surprisingly technical touch to put constant pressure on the opposing defense. The Australian forward has at the very least put in the energy and effort necessary to make things happen on the opposing team's side of the pitch, like his game winner against UNLV in the season opener. UCSB can only go as far as its best players take it however, and with set-piece beast and senior defender Faouzi Taieb sidelined with an injury, junior star forward Rodney Micheal has not stepped up to the plate yet.† Coming off a stellar campaign last season which put him in the conversation for best player in the conference, Micheal has not been able to produce the same magic so far in these first few games. Defenses are definitely game-planning for him now, and most teams are sending double teams as soon as he gets the ball. The great players take what the opposing team gives them and adjust, however, and whether it means trying to play off the ball more or looking to create and facilitate rather than solely attack, the Gauchos are going to need Micheal to be great if they're going to have any chance of making it deep into the Big West Tournament. While this result certainly wasn't what UCSB was looking for, the tough slate of games coming up means that there's no time to dwell on bad performances. Coach Vom Steeg selected an extremely challenging non-conference schedule for the team, including upcoming matchups against Gonzaga, Seattle University and Stanford all by the end of September. There might be a sharp learning curve, but if the Gauchos can pull it together and compete or possibly win a few of the games coming up they should be in great shape once conference play gets underway.

Through a balanced attack, Santa Barbara was able to net three goals in the first 20 minutes of the matchup, putting the game out of reach early on. Idaho, 2-4 on the year, came into this game on a two-game losing streak in which they only scored one goal between both games. In their most recent loss to Seattle, the Vandals struggled to find any sort of offensive rhythm which led to only eight shots on goal. Despite struggling out of the gate, Idaho's roster boasts extremely talented players, including sophomore midfielder Maddie Haas, who has two goals and an assist thus far. Santa Barbara set an aggressive tone early in the matchup as the Gauchos' pressure led to early turnovers for the Vandals in their own half of the field. UCSB netted their first goal of the game at the nine-minute mark as freshman midfielder Dylan Lewis was able to sneak the ball behind the defense, leading to sophomore forward Jessica Wright pushing it past the outstretched arm of the Idaho goalkeeper. The squad kept up their pressure and were rewarded soon after as junior midfielder Christine Maurer was able to score her first goal of the season. Maurer is one of the key players who many believe will keep the pressure off of senior star forward Shaelan Murison and provide consistency on the offensive end for Santa Barbara. Shortly after in the 20th minute, Murison would score a goal to put the Gauchos up 3-0, giving her squad a comfortable lead with over 70 minutes left to play. It was an encouraging sight for UCSB as the team stepped up offensively and used their defense to create opportunities for goals on the transition attack. Moreover, Idaho had a difficult time getting past the Gaucho defense as the Vandals only had two shots on goal that were both comfortably saved by senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese tallied her second clean sheet of the season and has looked extremely confident in front of goal. There were a lot of positives to take away from this matchup, but the one that stuck out the most was the growing chemistry among the players. It is apparent that as each game goes by, the starters will be more comfortable playing with each other, and this will hopefully lead to more wins. With both youth and experience currently on the roster, the expectation for UCSB is to win and compete for a title. While that is a tall task, this group has shown signs that they can accomplish that feat. Even though Murison will surely be double-teamed inside of the box in future games, there is a strong belief amongst the team that they can find the back of the net even if Murison is not directly involved in the play. As her teammates find more opportunities to score, it will be difficult for opposing teams to continue to double-team Murison as well. It will be crucial for Santa Barbara to continue to develop their identity as well, but it is starting to look like they will rely on their defense to create offensive opportunities for themselves. As this team becomes more consistent, it will surely be fun to watch them develop and hopefully contend for the Big West Title as the season goes on. UCSB is back at home this upcoming Friday against Grand Canyon at 7 p.m. inside Harder Stadium, as the 'Chos look to get their second win of the season.†

sports,No. 7 UCSB Men's Water Polo Finishes Undefeated At Triton Invitational,9-Sep-19,3:32 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-09/no-7-ucsb-mens-water-polo-finishes-undefeated-at-triton-invitational/,"Blocked by a defender, Ivan Gvozdanovic aims for the goal. Nexus File Photo The UCSB men's water polo team stormed into La Jolla for the Triton Invitational on Saturday and came out on Sunday with a sterling 4-0 record, their best start in six years. It was the first time UCSB has emerged from the Invitational undefeated. The No. 7 Gauchos soundly defeated one of their main conference rivals, beat a national juggernaut for the first time in 15 years and went undefeated in a tournament featuring several top-10 ranked teams. All in all, it was a pretty successful weekend. Although 14 different Gauchos scored during the tournament, just about half of the scoring was concentrated among four players: sophomore attacker Cole Brosnan, freshman attacker Sam Nangle, freshman driver Nathan Puentes and junior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic. Brosnan and Nangle led the team with six goals apiece, while Puentes and Gvozdanovic† followed close behind with five and four goals, respectively. Nangle and Puentes are both underclassmen , giving the UCSB attack the youthful flavor it will be looking for this season to replace Boris Jovanovic, last year's lead attacker. The Gauchos opened the Invitational with a 12-7 victory over Concordia, their only unranked opponent of the weekend. Second quarter goals from freshman attacker Nick Taylor and junior driver Marius Jakimcikas pushed the Eagles out to a 5-3 lead early, but it was almost all UCSB from there on out.† Six different Gauchos scored in the second quarter as Santa Barbara erased the deficit and ran up an 8-5 lead going into halftime. Brosnan completed the hat trick with his third goal of the match in the third quarter, and three more UCSB goals in the fourth locked in the victory. UCSB never trailed in the team's second game of the day, an 11-5 victory over No. 7 Pepperdine, a major Golden Coast Conference rival. The win gave the Gauchos their fifth straight victory against the Waves, who finished third in the conference last year. Nangle and sophomore attacker Tommy Hawkins paced UCSB with two goals apiece. Both of Hawkins' goals came at the end of the second quarter and rebuffed a Pepperdine surge that had cut the lead to one earlier in the quarter. The Gauchos kept pushing after halftime and added four goals from four different players over the final two quarters. The Waves were able to muster just one second-half goal in response, allowing UCSB to coast to a comfortable win. Invitation play picked back up on Sunday, when the Gauchos took on their toughest test of the tournament: the No. 4 Cal Golden Bears. Coming into the game, UCSB hadn't beaten Cal since 2004. They'd come close a number of times, including a 13-12 loss just last season, but it had been a mostly one-sided relationship. On Sunday, however, the Gauchos ended the decade-and-a-half-long streak with an 8-5 victory.† It was an even match in the first half, which saw UCSB fall behind 3-1 early, then claw back into a 4-3 lead and then enter halftime tied at four, all after a last-minute Cal goal. Goals from Nangle, Puentes, Ivan Gvozdanovic and Ryan Brosnan made for a balanced first half Gaucho attack. UCSB flipped a switch in the third quarter, however, and left Cal behind with four goals to take a commanding and durable 8-5 lead. Gvozdanovic and Puentes both scored again in the third, and goals from sophomore utility Connor Moynihan and senior attacker Jacob Halle added some breathing room for the Gauchos. Goalkeeper Danny Roland made sure UCSB didn't need much of that breathing room with nine saves in the match, including one five-meter penalty shot save late in the fourth quarter. Riding high from their streak-snapping win, the Gauchos avoided any sort of letdown just a few hours later, as they defeated No. 5 Long Beach State 12-9 for first place in the Triton Invitational.† The victory didn't just secure first place, but it also allowed the Gauchos to make a powerful statement of conference supremacy. LBSU entered this season tied with the University of the Pacific as the top-ranked Golden Coast Conference team, and they won the conference tournament last year.† The two teams see-sawed through the first quarter. Long Beach State opened up the scoring with a goal from sophomore utility Matt Morris just over three minutes in, but UCSB responded 20 seconds later with a Brosnan goal. The two teams went silent for a few minutes after that salvo but picked up again with a flurry of final minute goals that left the Gauchos ahead 3-2. While the first quarter was an even, tit-for-tat showdown, the second quarter was more of a Gauchos-only affair. UCSB scored five goals to LBSU's one and ran out to a healthy lead. Brosnan and Halle both notched their second goal of the game in the second quarter, and Gvozdanovic, Nangle and junior attacker Leo Yuno each chipped in a goal apiece as well. Roland, meanwhile, was a wall on the other end with five saves in the second quarter alone. It takes more than one good quarter to beat a top-five team, however, and Beach made that clear with a lopsided quarter of their own in the third. LBSU scored four goals to UCSB's one, cutting the deficit to 9-7 at the end of the third. Long Beach State added two more goals to start off the fourth quarter and tie the game at nine apiece. With just two minutes to go, UCSB redshirt freshman center Adam Lott stopped the slide and put the Gauchos back in the lead with his third goal of the tournament. Puentes found the back of the net just a few seconds later on a penalty shot, and one more insurance goal from senior driver Tommy Fellner gave UCSB their 12-9 victory. Roland finished the match with 18 saves, and Brosnan, Halle and Mason McQuet all finished with two goals each. The Gauchos travel to Redlands this coming weekend for the Inland Empire tournament where they'll look to keep their hot start going.

sports,UCSB Heads North for Doubleheader Matchup Against Gonzaga and Oregon State,11-Sep-19,6:23 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-11/ucsb-heads-north-for-doubleheader-matchup-against-gonzaga-and-oregon-state/," The regular season for Division 1 men's soccer continues this week as UCSB will test their away form in a doubleheader matchup on Thursday and Sunday.† First, the Gauchos will get the chance to snap their current two-game losing streak and return to a .500 win percentage against the struggling Gonzaga Bulldogs. Then the team will look to get an all-time series first-ever win, as they visit an on-fire Oregon Beavers side.† Following last week's disappointing 3-0 loss at home versus the Cal Bears, the Gauchos now find themselves at an overall record of 1-2 on the season.† In terms of NCAA D1 RPI, which ranks the top teams in the country by their record and strength of schedule, this ranks UCSB at 63rd in the nation ""ì with Gonzaga coming in at 185th and Oregon State at 32nd. And just like the Bears, the Beavers will prove to be yet another challenge worthy of being circled on the calendar as both sides received votes in the latest United Soccer Coaches poll.† As for the Bulldogs, the start to their season hasn't gone quite as planned considering the team's current four-game losing streak places them at a 0-4 overall record on the year. With Gonzaga's only home game resulting in a 1-2 loss to Sacramento State, a Big West Conference opponent to UCSB, this potential trap game features the Gauchos' best odds at getting back on track. Although this matchup looks favorable on paper, the record book preaches otherwise. UCSB trails in the all-time series against Gonzaga with an overall record of 2-4-1, as the Gauchos' previous victory occurred back in 2012; last time out, the Bulldogs were victorious on the road in a 2013 regular season matchup that ended 2-0.† The Beavers are in a much better situation at the moment, as Oregon State started their regular season at an overall record of 3-1. Following a 4-1 victory over Pacific earlier in the week, Oregon State has now extended their winning streak to three consecutive games.† Their team will face Grand Canyon University on the road Thursday before returning home to host the Gauchos and wrap up their tripleheader. UCSB has a unique opportunity here to notch a historic first-ever win versus Oregon State, as the Gauchos also trail in this one with an overall record of 0-2-1 in the all-time series; these two sides' last matchup featured a 2-2 double overtime result in the 2012 Gonzaga Nike Classic in Spokane, Washington.† Gauchos to keep an eye on for this week are junior defender Hunter Ashworth and senior defender Noah Billingsley. Both players were absent during the loss to Cal due to international duties for the New Zealand squad ""î they'll surely make a key impact in returning to Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg's side.† Theo O'Malley is the one to watch for Gonzaga, as the junior midfielder is tied for team-leading in both most goals (one) and most shots (seven) in his third year for the Bulldogs. The sophomore defender from Spain and Valencia C.F.'s youth system product, Adrian Crespo, is what makes Oregon State tick. The second-year man has a team-leading five total assists and is tied for most goals for the Beavers with two to his name.† UCSB first visits Gonzaga this Thursday, Sept. 12, then plays away again at Oregon State on Sunday, Sept. 15; both games are set to kick off at 7:00 p.m.

sports,Gauchos Return to Harder For Challenging Weekend Matchups,12-Sep-19,6:55 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/gauchos-return-to-harder-for-challenging-weekend-matchups/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team will be looking to build off of their first win of the season last weekend against Idaho as they return home to face Grand Canyon on Friday and Stanford on Sunday.† The 1-5 Antelopes of GCU are in a bit of a tailspin after losing five consecutive matches by a combined score of 16-3. They have been unable to find any rhythm this season, and they likely view this upcoming game in Santa Barbara as a chance to end this streak.† The ""òLopes are a very young squad with ten freshmen and only one senior on the roster and were voted to finish fifth out of nine teams in the WAC. This means that many people view GCU as a middle-tier team, and it will likely not be long before they end up on the right side of a few games.† When examining the struggles the Antelopes have faced this season, you must take a look at their defense and goals allowed. GCU has allowed several high-scoring games from opponents, such as their 1-7 loss against FAU and their 0-4 loss at the hands of UTSA. The Gauchos will look to attack early and often in order to gain the upper hand in this match. However, even with their struggles Grand Canyon is a team that attacks relentlessly on the offensive end, where they average 12.2 shots per game. These attempts have only resulted in four goals so far this season, but their offensive attack is something that can give teams issues, especially if it is not prepared for and taken seriously.† The Gauchos' first big test of the season will come on Sunday as they go head-to-head with the No. 2 ranked Stanford Cardinal. Stanford is undefeated in their five games so far this year, with two of those wins coming against top-15 opponents.  Stanford is a perennial powerhouse in women's soccer due to their 21 consecutive NCAA tournaments berths and two national championships victories over the past decade. The Cardinal have once again been picked to win the Pac-12, mostly due to the return of five All-Conference players from a season ago as well as the return of two-time ESPNW Player of the Year and MAC Hermann Trophy winner junior Catarina Macario. Macario has picked up right where she left off last year as she has scored nine goals in the Cardinal's first five games, good for second in the nation. Not far behind her is senior Carly Malatskey, who has five goals on the season. Stanford has five players with multiple goals so far in 2019, which shows just how potent their offense can be. As a team, Stanford is second in the NCAA in goals with 26, third in assists with 29, and first in shots per game with 24.6. UCSB will surely have their hands full dealing with that much firepower. Stanford is an elite team in all aspects of the game, and while a true challenger has been difficult to come by this season, their one possible weakness might be at the goalie position. The Cardinal's keeper for the last two seasons graduated last year, and the three keepers on their roster for this year have yet to see much action over the course of their careers. Senior Lauren Rood and redshirt freshman Katie Meyer have split playing time over Stanford's first five contests, with Rood starting three games and Meyer starting for two.  Both goalkeepers have only 18 combined starts for their careers, and while they are competent and skilled players, they will be more prone to mistakes that UCSB could take advantage of. The Gauchos will look to notch their second and third win of the season against GCU on Friday at 7:00 p.m. and against Stanford on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. Both games will be played at Harder Stadium.

sports,UCSB Women's Volleyball Set to Host Thunderdome Classic,12-Sep-19,3:56 PM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-12/ucsb-womens-volleyball-set-to-host-thunderdome-classic/,"After receiving a quick set, Rowan Ennis hits down the middle. Nexus File Photo UCSB hosts the Thunderdome Classic this weekend where they will look to stay hot against some tough competition. The Gauchos will play University of San Diego on Friday, a team that has played much better than their 2-3 record would suggest. Despite the Gauchos owning an impressive 5-1 record up to this point, the Toreros have the upper hand in kills per set, assists per set, ball handling errors and service errors. UCSB will have to be clinical and composed if they are to go into Saturday with another win. UCSB will host both La Salle University and Harvard University on Saturday in what should prove to be an exciting weekend. La Salle is coming off a 1-3 loss to Northern Arizona last weekend, but had previously swept both Seton Hall and Binghamton in their two matches prior. While Seton Hall and Binghamton have combined for a 2-12 record, La Salle did take down 5-2 (currently) Bowling Green at the Golden Dome Invitational at Notre Dame in week two of the season. Harvard meanwhile has only played three games, but are 2-1 with wins against Sacred Heart and Rhode Island and a loss to Colgate. Harvard is led by junior Evelyn Gray who has posted 35 kills in three games. The Harvard lineup will feature five players who currently have 20 kills or more, though the Gauchos have six such players, including Tasia Farmer with 19. While it isn't necessarily fair to compare these types of statistics considering the difference in games played, it is important to note that if Gray were to keep her pace in the next two games, she would still be far off from UCSB star Lindsey Ruddins, who has 114 through six games. Harvard posses a much superior hitting percentage thus far (.259 to .199), though UCSB's higher kill count and better digs per set clip (15.48 to 9.85) suggest the Gauchos will be able to secure victories from extended rallies. Over in Santa Barbara, Ruddins has taken home her first Big West Player of the Week award for 2019 and the 10th of her career. She is now tied for second all-time with Hawaii's Nikki Taylor and only one behind Cal Poly's Kylie Atherstone. Ruddins managed 59 kills and 34 digs in 13 sets this past weekend and will look to lead the charge into UCSB's first home tournament of the season. While much of the talk here at the Nexus has been centered around Ruddins, the supporting cast, or rather the phenomenal depth of this lineup, features a variety of players who have dominated at their positions. Sophomore Zoe Fleck has racked up 24 assists and 87 digs, the latter number being a team-high, all the while committing just a single error. Freshman Deni Wilson has had a successful start to her collegiate career to say the least, as she is second on the team in blocks per set while also only committing the fourth-most errors on the team. Awareness and athleticism are her game and she'll look to stay in stride heading into the weekend. Sophomore Olivia Lovenberg leads the team by far with 151 assists with second place going to freshman Romoni Vivao and her 109 helpers. Lovenberg is also fifth in digs per set and a composed eighth in errors committed. Lovenberg is an all-around player and, at the sophomore level, has plenty of room to grow. Expect a big season from her. As previously mentioned, another freshman gets the spotlight as Vivao is second on the team in assists and hasn't committed a single error. That's right, not a single one. The Gauchos thus far have taken a huge step forward thanks to a much composed lineup that is years ahead of personal and team expectations. While Ruddins is a senior, that conversation will have to wait. This is a young team with talent up and down the lineup that will look to make its mark in Gaucho history. The Thunderdome Classic kicks off Friday night at 6:00 p.m. while games against La Salle and Harvard will start Saturday at noon and 7:00 p.m. respectively.†

Nexus File Photo The UCSB men's water polo team has already knocked off two of the top four teams in the country. This weekend, they'll be gunning to knock out another. In fact, the No. 4 Gauchos will be gunning against the top team in all the land: the No. 1 USC Trojans. UCSB will take on last year's national champions on Sunday, in the team's fourth game out of five at the Inland Empire Classic at Redlands and La Verne. The Gauchos enter the tournament on a mission to keep their good early-season vibes rolling. A clean sweep of last weekend's Triton Invitational has UCSB at 4-0 to start the new year, with a first-place tournament finish under their belt as well. The successful showing in La Jolla included an 8-5 victory over then-No. 4 Cal and a 12-9 victory over then-No. 5 Long Beach State. Those victories helped push the Gauchos up three spots in the Collegiate Water Polo Association rankings, from No. 7 to No. 4. A matchup against the Trojans this weekend presents the Gauchos another chance to make a big jump in the rankings, but it's just one of five games UCSB will play on Saturday and Sunday. First up is Fresno Pacific, whom UCSB last played almost a year agoon Sept. 15. The Gauchos won that game in Davis 17-10, and they'll look to repeat that result 364 days later this Saturday. The Sunbirds had a much less successful Triton Invitational than the Gauchos did. Fresno Pacific went 0-4, including a 19-6 thrashing at the hands of Long Beach State.† Redshirt junior driver Jacob Fairchild led the Sunbirds in goals last season with 38 and returns this year as the team's primary offensive threat. Junior center Uros Pelemis, meanwhile, had the strongest game of the invitational of any Fresno Pacific player with six goals in the four games. After playing Fresno Pacific, the Gauchos will take on Occidental at 11:40 a.m. on Saturday. Occidental is the No. 9 Division III team in the country and sports a 4-0 record of their own so far this season. Those four wins are all against Division III teams, but the Tigers showed off a powerhouse attack in each victory. Occidental scored a total of 73 goals, including 23 in just one game against Citrus College. UCSB gets a couple hours to rest after taking on Occidental but then dives right back into the action at 4 p.m. Saturday afternoon when they play Redlands. The Bulldogs are 2-2 and ranked No. 6 in Division III. Redlands split its four games last weekend at the Rare Air ""ì Air Force Invitational on divisional lines, winning two games against Division III teams and losing to its two Division I opponents. One of those Division I opponents was No. 15 George Washington University, who just squeaked by the Bulldogs 10-7. Senior center Cooper Krause was likely Redlands' MVP in the Air Force Invitational and punctuated his weekend with a five-goal showing against Salem International. The center tossed in two more goals against GWU, showing off an ability to score against top competition. The next day, the Gauchos will finally get their chance to take on the defending national champions at 10:20 a.m. USC has yet to play a game this season, but they'll have played twice on Saturday before taking on UCSB. Sunday's game will be a chance for major vengeance for the Gauchos. The two teams met twice last season and the Trojans won both times, by a combined score of 26-5. Keeping that recent history in mind, even a close loss on Sunday would be evidence of significant growth for UCSB. Of course, the Gauchos will be striving for more than just significant growth and a moral victory. To pull off the upset, UCSB must limit the USC attack, which returns its top three contributors from 2018. Junior driver Jacob Mercep led the Trojans last season with 62 goals, while sophomore driver Hannes Daube and junior driver Marko Vavic weren't far behind with 58 and 57, respectively. USC is also bringing back its top goalie, sophomore Nic Porter, who registered 164 saves in 19 games last season. This is, in other words, a very similar Trojan team to the one that handled the Gauchos so easily in 2018. UCSB has one more game after taking on USC, a 2:20 p.m. matchup against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Colleges. CMS also participated in the Triton Invitational last weekend and went 1-3, but is still ranked No. 3 among all Division III schools. That's in large part because two of those three losses were to teams now ranked ninth in Division I. The first team, UC San Diego, gave the Stags a 12-2 walloping, but CMS came close to pulling off the upset against the second, UC Irvine, before falling 8-7. Senior attacker Zack Rossman scored seven goals across the four games of the invitational, leading the team and was the Stags' best attacker last season with 44 goals. The UCSB defensive gameplan, then, will likely be focused on limiting Rossman's opportunities in what should be a contested inter-divisional match. UCSB plays its first game of the Inland Empire Classic on Saturday at 10:20 a.m. against Fresno Pacific. Live stream links for most of the tournament games can be found here.

Nexus File Photo The UCSB men's soccer team picked up their second win of the season Thursday night, beating the Gonzaga Bulldogs 1-0 in a chippy matchup. The Gauchos moved up to 2-2 with the victory while the Bulldogs fifth straight loss dropped them down to 0-5. The conversation surrounding UCSB these last couple weeks has been dominated by speculation on how the team was going to be able to survive with key absences on the defensive end. In the past two games, the Gauchos have had to play without the entire starting backline and gave up six goals, or half of the goals they let in all of last season. While freshman defender Lucas Gonzalez and senior defender Faouzi Taieb are still out with injuries for the foreseeable future, the Gauchos got back defensive stalwarts Noah Billingsley and Hunter Ashworth from international play, and they made a huge difference in last night's game. The Gauchos were on the attack from the jump on Thursday night, seemingly emboldened by their new-look defensive line to play a more aggressive brand of offense.† No one took advantage of this free-flowing style of play more than junior transfer Ameyawu Muntari, who simply controlled the left side of the pitch for the first 15 minutes. The Ghanian forward almost picked up his first assist of the season just five minutes in, when he burned a Bulldog defender on the left wing and lobbed in a cross that narrowly missed the leg of Gaucho forward Rodney Michael.† UCSB was able to settle in, slow the game down a bit and play more of a possession style offense in the first half, something we hadn't really seen from the team this season.† Ashworth and Billingsley's ability to calmly yet forcefully bring the ball up from the defensive end was key to opening up the field for the Gauchos. The game must have looked slow for the two defenders after having just played with some of the best young players in the world as part of the U-23 New Zealand international team.† Billingsley in particular seemed to always be just a step ahead of the Bulldog players. In the 36th minute he took the ball up from the defensive third, crossed over three Gonzaga defenders and snuck a pass to a streaking Thibault Candia, who set up Muntari with a perfect pass which he curled just to the right of the goal. The senior did a great job of balancing his offensive attacks with smart defensive plays, something that Gauchos had been missing in these last couple games. UCSB didn't score in the first half but dominated possession. The team took five shots as a whole, only gave up one shot to the Zags and sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach did not have to make a single save in the entire period. Although their record might not show it, the Bulldogs are a tough team and they came out strong to start the second half. Gonzaga began to ramp up the pressure on the Gauchos in the first few minutes, but this also left them more prone to UCSB counterattacks. In the 49th minute, the Bulldogs cleared a UCSB freekick and sent numbers downfield to attack the Gauchos' defense. Gonzaga midfielder Joe Corner then initiated one of the strangest sequences of the game when his shot ricocheted off the post, was centered back in and almost knocked in for an own-goal by Hunter Ashworth. Ashworth cleared it back out to Corner who slammed a shot straight at Ben Roach who then popped the ball up directly to Bulldog midfielder Frankie Ljucovic, who eventually headed the ball off the post and out of play. Just as momentum seemed to be shifting to the Zags, the Gauchos finally notched what would be a controversial yet game-winning goal. In the 57th minute, Muntari took the ball down the right-wing and rocketed a cross straight into the Bulldog defense. The defenders botched the clearance and sent the ball straight up into the air, and both UCSB midfielder Finn Ballard McBride and Gonzaga goalkeeper Cole Rovegno jumped to make a play on the ball only to end up colliding with no call being made. As this was happening, sophomore forward Carter Clemmensen slid through the defense and pounced on the ball when it fell in front of him, knocking in his first goal of the season. The Bulldog players and coaching staff let the referee have it for the rest of the match, even after a favorable call went their way in the 66th minute when Ashworth got mostly ball on a slide tackle but was called for a foul just outside of the box. Ljucovic struck a curling free kick into the upper right corner of the goal which was saved by Roach. From that point on, the Bulldogs never really threatened again. This was a great win for the Gauchos as it both stopped their two-game losing streak and gave them confidence for some tough matchups in the next couple weeks. Games against Oregon State, Seattle U and Stanford will surely test UCSB before they start up conference season, but this past game showed that when fully healthy, this team is going to be very tough to beat.

Nexus File Photo The UCSB women's volleyball team came out of the Thunderdome Classic 3-0 and ultimately victorious. The weekend kicked off as the ""òChos played the University of San Diego on Friday Sept. 13. After starting out a bit slow and eventually dropping the first set to USD, the ""òChos went 3-0 to emerge victorious 3-1.† The win was highlighted by an impressive 20 kill- and 14-dig-double-double from senior outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins, which marks her third straight 20-kill match. Rowan Ennis continues to come up big in key moments by adding 10 kills and eight blocks while allowing UCSB to put away USD late in the contest by catalyzing an 8-1 run which put the third set out of reach.† Freshman Romoni Vivao posted 25 assists and nine digs in her first ever home game putting the cherry on top of a commanding win. USD put up a good fight, but ultimately could not match the offensive onslaught of the ""òChos ""î with Megan Jacobsen putting up 16 kills and the rest of the team much farther behind that. La Salle University was UCSB's second challenger in the Thunderdome Classic.† La Salle seemed to be the biggest threat to the ""òChos with the high offensive output from outside Samantha Graver, who went on to put up 20 kills. Other than Graver, the rest of La Salle was unable to play at a high enough efficiency throughout the game to get the win. The ""òChos swept La Salle 3-0. Ruddins was two kills short of pushing the 20-kill streak to four straight games, but still provided the majority of the Gaucho offense.† Ennis put up an impenetrable blocking wall, boasting seven kills out of the 50 total Gaucho kills. Ennis has frankly played on another level these past few weeks. She has really been able to cement herself as a defensive force on the court that teams are going to have trouble scheming around.

Nexus File Photo The No. 4 UCSB men's water polo team had an eye-opening showing over the weekend at the Inland Empire Classic. The Gauchos' confidence was riding high coming into the weekend's slate of games following their first place finish at the Triton Invitational last week. The match of the weekend would end up being No. 4 UCSB versus No. 1 USC, a gritty battle until the final whistle. Basically the Gauchos came in hoping to make a statement and prove that they were one of the top teams in the country, and they did just that, coming out on top in the tournament and finishing with a 9-0 record. The Gauchos opened up their five-game weekend on Saturday when they took on Fresno Pacific. Almost every player got minutes in this matchup as UCSB handled Fresno easily by a score of 25-5. One of the benefits of starting off the season strongly is the leeway that gives the team to experiment with different line-ups and give younger players a chance to get acclimated. This played out in one of the most exciting sequences of the match when redshirt freshman John Rankin and Sean Rosenberg each recorded their first career D-1 goals.†† The next two contests went much like their opener, as the Gauchos would go on to defeat Occidental 22-7, and Redlands 18-4. UCSB's depth was on display again as all 20 field players recorded a goal in one of the three opening day games. As scoring came at ease, it was the way the Gauchos defended and controlled the tempo that was impressive. The fact that they can combine a high-scoring offense with this ability to pick their spots and maintain possession is what makes this UCSB team so dangerous.† Day two of the tournament started off with the heavyweight matchup of UCSB and No. 1 USC. There was a lot of buzz around this matchup as both teams are in serious title contention this year. UCSB jumped out to an early lead after one period, but were only up one at the half.  The second half is when the Gauchos took over. Junior attacker Cole Brosnan was key to the second-half surge, putting two huge shots away. The third-year southpaw out of Newport Beach would finish with five goals, as UCSB beat top-ranked USC 13-9. This was UCSB's first regular season win versus USC since 1990.† UCSB's final game of the tournament was against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. Sophomore center Sam Nangle anchored the team, finishing with four goals, and 11 other Gauchos notched goals. This would would end as a 15-4 win for UCSB. With this win, the team won the tournament and improved to 9-0 on the season, tied for their best start in school history.† The Gauchos will look to make it 11-0 after a double header this Thursday as they match up with Ottawa at 12:00 p.m. and Pepperdine at 5:00 p.m.

sports,"Gauchos Look To Get Back On Track, Face Fresno St. and LMU",19-Sep-19,5:15 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/gauchos-look-to-get-back-on-track-face-fresno-st-and-lmu/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team, 1-2-3 on the year, is back in action this week as the squad takes on Fresno State at home this Friday and Loyola Marymount on Sunday in LA. After a disappointing past week, Santa Barbara will look to get back on track by creating more opportunities on the counterattack where the squad has struggled as of late. Fresno State has been extremely impressive this season as the team has an overall record of 3-1-1 thus far. In their most recent matchup against Weber State, the Bulldogs dominated with a 2-0 victory. Sophomore midfielder Mariona Segales and redshirt junior Emma Chivers lead the way offensively for Fresno State with two goals each. On the defensive side of the ball, freshman goalkeeper Milena Zink has accumulated 10 saves already on the season with a save percentage of 83.3%. In order for UCSB to have success against Fresno State, it will be important for the ""òChos to pressure the bulldog midfielders into turning the ball over on their side of the pitch. This will allow Santa Barbara to find more opportunities for transition offensive attacks against a very talented bulldog team. Loyola Marymount has struggled mightily this season as their current record is 0-5-2 ""î the team is on a two-game losing streak as well. The Lions lost to No. 13 Washington State in Pullman this past Sunday as the team was unable to score an equalizer. Junior midfielder Maki Kono had the only goal of the night for Loyola Marymount and is currently the team's leading goal scorer. Santa Barbara will need to be on their top game against the Lions who are much more talented than their record would indicate. The Gauchos will need to find ways to win close games, especially with the team already having three ties thus far. That being said, the squad is extremely young and is still trying to find their identity as a team. With more game experience, not only will the chemistry increase but so will the confidence of the team. One of the issues that Santa Barbara has faced primarily has been the inability to create opportunities to score. Senior forward Shaelan Murison seems to be one of the few players on the roster who can consistently find the back of the net but has now been taken out of the game as opposing teams have double teamed her inside the box. In order for UCSB to contend for the Big West title this year, another forward must emerge as a consistent goal scorer.
Sophomore forward Jessica Wright seems to be the most likely candidate to step up for the ""òChos as she has two goals already this season. If more players start to score for the Gauchos, this will inevitably free up Murison for her own opportunities to find the back of the net. Defensively, the Gauchos have been strong as the team has produced three clean sheets and has given up an average of only one goal per game. Much of this can be attributed to the strong play in front of the goal by senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese has looked confident in front of the goal, leading to her save percentage of 80%. The senior was just selected as the Big West Defensive Player of the Week, a fitting reward for a week which saw her give up a stingy .9 goals per game to go along with a .846 save percentage on average. Moreover, UCSB's defenders have been formidable as well as opposing offensive players have struggled to get past them. UCSB will face Fresno State at home this upcoming Friday at 7 p.m and Loyola Marymount on Sunday at 1 p.m, where the Gauchos will try to get back in the win column at Harder.

sports,No. 2 UCSB Men's Water Polo Aiming For Best Start in Program History,19-Sep-19,5:00 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-19/no-2-ucsb-mens-water-polo-aiming-for-best-start-in-program-history/,"Nexus File Photo The season is still less than two weeks old, but this year's UCSB men's water polo team is off to one of its best starts in program history. With four games this weekend, including games against No. 6 Pepperdine and No. 1 Stanford, the Gauchos have a chance to stake a claim on the best start outright. A 9-0 start to the season and wins over then-No. 4 Cal and then-No. 1 USC have propelled UCSB into a tie for the No. 2 ranking with UCLA. It's the first time the Gauchos have been ranked No. 2 since October 2012, and the 9-0 mark is tied for the best record to start the season since 1988. The Gauchos will get their chance to break the record on Thursday afternoon, when they host Ottawa University ""ì Arizona. The Ottawa squad is 1-7 so far this year, including a 16-5 loss to the University of Redlands. UCSB crushed Redlands 18-4 this past Saturday, providing an indication of how Thursday's match might go. Ottawa gets much of its scoring from freshman utility Shaine Sargis, who tallied four goals and four assists in their most recent match. Zackery Whiddon serves as the team's 6'6""ù freshman goalkeeper and has had an up-and-down go of it so far this season. The Arizona branch of Ottawa University opened in 2017 as an offshoot of the main campus in Ottawa, Kansas. As a result, the Spirit team is quite young: all but four of the team's players are freshmen. Those freshmen, and their four elder counterparts, will be facing a tall task on Thursday. The trick for UCSB will be to avoid seeing the game as a simple warm up to the main event, a 5 p.m. game that same day against Pepperdine. One of the Gauchos' foremost rivals, the Waves are 8-1 on the season. UCSB provided the one blemish with an 11-5 victory over Pepperdine at the Triton Invitational. Pepperdine has bounced back, however, taking down No. 9 Long Beach State, No. 11 UC San Diego, No. 14 Loyola Marymount and No. 19 California Baptist since then. Sophomore attacker Balazs Kosa has provided the main force behind the Waves' attack with a team-leading 25 goals and 15 assists. The Gauchos held Kosa scoreless in the first meeting, but Kosa put on a show last weekend at the Inland Empire Classic, scoring eight goals in three games on Sunday alone. If UCSB is able to silence Kosa again, or at least muffle him, the Gauchos stand a good chance of a repeat verdict and another powerful statement in early season Golden Coast Conference play. Another win over Pepperdine would be one more strong point on UCSB's growing resume, but the real opportunity comes Friday, when the Gauchos travel to Palo Alto to take on Stanford, the number one team in the nation. The Cardinal are 5-0 so far this year with wins over two ranked teams: No. 12 Princeton and No. 18 San Jose State. No team has finished within 10 points of Stanford so far. Stanford has two 2018 first-team All-Americans, redshirt junior two-meter Ben Hallock and senior driver Bennett Williams, returning to this year's team; both have excelled so far this season. The goalkeeper position is a bit more tumultuous, with third-team All-American Oliver Lewis now graduated, but the Cardinal have rotated between senior Andrew Chun and sophomore George Hagestad so far to solid results. UCSB will look to take advantage of the turnover in goal to become the first team not only to crack the 10-point firewall, but to pull off the upset. The Gauchos last defeated Stanford in 2016, but the team has broken longer losing streaks already this season. The Gauchos cap off their weekend with a rematch against Fresno Pacific at Campus Pool on Saturday. The two teams met last Saturday at the Inland Empire Classic, where UCSB trounced Fresno 25-5. With just a week between the two matches, it's unlikely that this Saturday's result will be much different. The Gauchos maintained a consistent and scorching barrage on the Sunbirds' goal the first time around, scoring seven times in the first quarter and nine times in the fourth. Fans should expect more of the same at Campus Pool this weekend. It's a proper gauntlet run of a week for the Gauchos, complete with a warm up and a cooldown. Should the team make it through unscathed, or at least unembarrassed, they'll have made history and continued perhaps the hottest start in program history.

Nexus File Photo The No. 2 ranked UCSB men's water polo team made history on Thursday evening following a convincing 19-2 victory at Campus Pool over Ottawa University of Arizona. With the win, the Gauchos are now 10-0 in the season and officially hold the school record for best start to a season beating the 1988 UCSB team which also started 9-0. ""úIt is great to do. It's not something we were focused on but it came along the way, so we are happy to have it. We have played some really tough games, so it wasn't like we coasted to it and that makes it really satisfying,""ù Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. UCSB was on fire from the start, taking an 8-0 lead in the first quarter. Senior driver Tommy Fellner scored two goals in the opening frame and also had help from Sam Nagle who also tallied two thanks to two great passes from Ryan Bronson. By halftime, the Gauchos were up 14-1. Strong play down low was a key reason for the Gauchos success as most goals in the first half were scored in the red area. UCSB's offense slowed down in the second half, only scoring five goals, but the team did more than enough in the first half to get it done pulling out the 17-point victory. The top scorer for UCSB was sophomore utility Connor Moynihan who notched four goals in the match. 11 other Gaucho players also got on the board against Ottawa, showcasing the depth this UCSB team has compared to the last few years. ""úWe have just never had a team where we are strong at every position and then also we are about three-deep strong on every position so we have all the bases covered. We only lost one player from last year so everyone is playing better,""ù Wigo said. UCSB has one more match, at 5 p.m. against No. 6 Pepperdine, at Campus Pool today. Comments are closed.

The Gauchos are 3-2 after having taken down Gonzaga and Oregon State in their last two games, while the Redhawks own a very symmetrical 2-2-2 record to kick off the season. UCSB is coming into this matchup looking to continue to build positive momentum with a tough final slate of non-conference games looming at the end of the month. The biggest question for the Gauchos so far has been the presence, or lack thereof, of their defensive players. Early injuries to senior defender Faouzi Taieb and freshman Lucas Gonzalez, along with Hunter Ashworth and Noah Billingsley being called up to play for the New Zealand U-23 squad, left the team with a depleted backline to start off the year. While there is no official return date for Taieb or Gonzalez (who seemed to have the more serious injury of the two), both Billingsley and Ashworth returned last weekend and have already made a world of difference. UCSB conceded six goals in two losses prior to their return; since they have been back, they have scored four goals while conceding only one with two wins. The Kiwis' sturdy defensive presence allows players in the middle like Sahid Conteh and Thibault Candia to have more of an attacking mindset instead of having to worry about supporting in the back third. Their ability to push the ball up has helped create space for the wingers and forwards as well. Seattle University has had a textbook roller coaster start to the season. The Redhawks have notched impressive wins against USF, who they handily defeated 5-0, and the University of Portland. Their .500 record is slightly deceiving however, as both losses were to quality teams (No. 16 Notre Dame and No. 12 University of Washington) and they tied one of the best teams in the country in No. 4 Indiana University. The team is led by redshirt junior forward Noe Meza, who has been a scoring phenom to start this season off. The Washington native leads both the team and the Western Athletic Conference in goals (four), and is also fourth in the conference in shots. Meza led the team in scoring last season as well (eight) and is not new to the Seattle U/UCSB rivalry. He scored the pivotal goal in their 2-0 win over the Gauchos last year and will certainly be on the hunt for another against this season against the depleted SB backline. One of the key facets of this game might actually not even have anything to do with the players themselves, but rather where the game is being played. The Redhawks still haven't picked up a win on the road this year, losing their only away game and tying their only game on neutral ground. UCSB is trying to get Harder Stadium back to the fortress it was last season, when they posted an undefeated 9-0-1 record, but early injuries hindered them in their two latest home matchups against UC Berkeley and No.17 Virginia Tech. The crowd might not be as large as this move-in weekend when the team takes on University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), but if enough students are back to kick off the quarter then it could be one of the deciding factors. The Gauchos will have their work cut out for them on the defensive end but their offense will determine how well they can compete against a high-powered Seattle squad. Goalscoring has been by committee so far this year, with six different players scoring so far and no player scoring more than once. One notable absence from the stat sheets this season has been star forward Rodney Micheal, who led the team in scoring last season but has yet to notch a goal so far this year. Whether defense has been honing in on him more or it's just a personal slump, Micheal has not been the attacking force that the team is going to need to have a successful year. Watch for him to try to take advantage of a Redhawk defense that just gave up three goals in their last game. This game might not count towards UCSB's conference record, which will ultimately determine the team's chance at making it to the NCAA Tournament, but the Gauchos need to get some positive momentum as Big West play approaches. With a matchup against powerhouse No. 2 Stanford drawing nearer, this game will be a good test to see how close this squad is to being able to compete against the top teams in the country. UCSB versus Seattle U kicks off at 7 p.m Thursday night at Harder Stadium here on campus. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 19, 2019, edition of the Daily Nexus.

Nexus File Photo The Gauchos finished with a 3-0 record overall this past weekend and suffered just two set losses, one to San Diego and the other to Harvard. A dominant showing by UCSB's junior middle blocker Rowan Ennis was enough to earn her Big West Defensive Player of the Week honors. Ennis finished the weekend with 30 kills, 22 blocks and 11 digs while hitting .423. A monstrous .650 hitting percentage and 13 kills easily put away Harvard in the last game of the tournament. UCLA came to town Wednesday night to take on UCSB on Gauchos Give night. The Bruins were coming off a 0-3 loss at Hawai'i and looking to get back on track before they face their infamous rival USC next Wednesday. Despite their 5-3 record overall coming into this matchup, UCLA had previously won five straight games thanks to junior Mac May and her 112 kills. The Bruins continue to be one of the few teams nationwide to have only played three sets each game, but the Gauchos were able to turn the tables in this matchup with a dominating performance that led to their first victory over UCLA since 1998. UCSB ended up sweeping the Bruins (25-16, 25-16, 28-26), finishing with a season high in kill percentage (.394) and a season low number of errors (nine). Lindsey Ruddins was yet again the most dominant player on the court. The senior outside hitter posted a monstrous 17 kills which led both teams and was also the leader in total points with 19. Ruddins has been on a tear to kick off her senior year, landing in the top-30 nationwide in both points per set and kills per set so far. While her individual success is almost expected at this point, the way that the team has produced around her is what has really been special so far. ""úI'm so excited for this team and for the future of this program,""ù Ruddins said postgame. ""ú I think that everyone is super dialed in to play their best, and just going out and taking it to these [top-ranked] teams.""ù Ruddins' performance was not even the most intriguing storyline of the night for the Gauchos however. That distinction belonged to freshman outside hitter Tallulah Froley. The Half Moon Bay native had a career night, posting her career high in kills (15) and coming through for the team when they needed it the most. Froley closed out the first and last sets with crucial kills that guaranteed the win for UCSB, and posted an extremely efficient .667 kill percentage which she made sure to point out was partially a result of the great sets she received from her teammates. ""úI honestly think if I'm in the mindset of ""òjust go out there and kill it,' I'll hopefully get [kills],""ù she explained. ""ú[Setter] Olivia Lovenberg just gave me perfect opportunities and it was just fun to put away the ball.""ù The Gauchos were actually down to set-point in the last set, trailing by a score of 21-24, before roaring back to claim the set 28-26 and finish off the historic sweep. ""úWe've had our backs against the wall a few times this season, even in five set matches, and that's been good practice for us because we found ways to preservere,""ù Coach Welch pointed out postgame. ""úAnd it happened again tonight in a bigger moment.""ù Looking ahead, 4-6 Pepperdine come to town Friday night coming off four straight losses and will be looking to right the ship before it's too late. UCSB has the upper hand in almost every major category, but it is the ability for teams to win the games they need to win that defines their mentality. A win over the Waves is a must if this team is to compete with 9-0 Hawai'i and stave off 7-2 Fullerton. UCSB's seven-match win streak now puts them into a tie for the 12th best record in the nation and is their best start since 2002. After a season that saw individual efforts win some games, the Gauchos have surged up the standings 10 games in and have proven to be cold-blooded killers. With a 28-9 set record thus far, UCSB has excelled at punishing opponents early and keeping the pressure on. The upcoming match against Pepperdine will kick off at 6 p.m. on Friday night at the Thunderdome. A version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Sept. 19, 2019, edition of the Daily Nexus.

Thursday night's match began neck and neck as both teams peppered in early shots with none hitting the mark or really testing the goalkeepers. By the 14th minute of play, several set pieces were earned as each corner kick posed a threat to open the score for either side.† However, it was UCSB's incessant pressure at the middle of the pitch that caused the visitor's first, and determining, error of the game. And at the 24-minute mark, it was senior forward Sahid Conteh who scored the crucial goal for the Gauchos ""î bringing the home side up one nil.† It was Conteh's brilliant work rate that caused Redhawks midfielder Hamish Ritchie to force a pass back to his teammate, Nkosi Burgess. All Conteh had to do at that point was to dispossess Burgess, dribble to the right of the penalty area to get Seattle goalkeeper Akili Kasim out of position, and then slot in the ball perfectly across to the opposite post ""î which he did, and made it look easy whilst doing so.† This was Conteh's first goal of the season, as he shares the team-leading goalscorer spot with six other Gauchos. The remainder of the first half of play saw a bit more confidence in UCSB's play, with the team dominating possession more and more.† Sophomore forward Carter Clemmensen for the Gauchos received the first yellow card of the match as UCSB closed the half with their 1-0 lead.† Highlights of the second half include two spectacular saves by UCSB's sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach, not to mention a shot by Seattle University that bounced off the crossbar. Burgess did his team no favors after being sent off in the 55th minute due to a studs-up challenge.† This was a match ridden with fouls ""î 34 in total ""î but the unnecessary red card had the Redhawks playing down to 10 men for the majority of the second half. Ritchie also went on to get booked in the 76th minute.† As for the Gauchos, Conteh and sophomore midfielder Sam Fletcher were also painted yellow for their fouls in the second half.† Still, UCSB managed to hold off Seattle University for a solid 1-0 victory at Harder Stadium and they'll look to take this momentum into this weekend's matchup.† The Gauchos will be staying at home again this week for their seventh regular season installment as UCSB hosts the UMBC Retrievers this Sunday, Sept. 22, at 7:00 p.m.

What makes this win even more impressive is that UCSB essentially flipped the script from last Sunday's match, where they were unable to muster any shots against Stanford's stellar defense, as they held Fresno State to only two shots for the whole game.† The Gauchos set the tone for this game at the outset as they immediately penetrated the Fresno State defense by taking three shots in the first eight minutes, and ultimately set up senior Lynsee Voss to score their first goal of the game. With an early lead to play with, the Gaucho defense locked down, and Fresno State took their final shot attempt of the game at the 28-minute mark in the first half as they had no answer for UCSB's defensive attack. The defense limited Fresno so much that senior goalie and reigning Big West Defensive Player of the Week Hanna DeWeese only needed to save one shot on goal on Friday in order to achieve her third complete-game shutout of the season.† In the second half the Gauchos got on the board again as senior Shaelan Murison scored her team-leading fourth goal of the season at the 51-minute mark. Then, just nine minutes later Murison assisted on Isabella Viana's first goal of the season to extend the lead to 3-0 at the 60-minute mark in the second half.† UCSB got two more shots on goal but were unable to convert and the game ended with the final score 3-0 in favor of the Gauchos. The Gauchos will now hit the road on Sunday for a date with the struggling Loyola Marymount Lions, who are winless on the season with a record of 0-6-2. Head Coach Paul Stumpf will likely attempt to replicate Friday's game plan in hopes that the defensive strategy that shut down a team with some firepower like Fresno State will also work wonders against an LMU team that lacks talent and depth compared to some of UCSB's previous opponents.† This game will serve as an opportunity for UCSB to build momentum both offensively and defensively after they dominated on both sides in their last game.† The Lions have put eight balls in the net so far this year for an average of one goal per game. Their leading goal-scorer is junior Maki Kono, who has two goals on the season on a team-leading 12 shot attempts. She's one player the Gauchos must focus on containing in order to come out on top. Redshirt sophomore forward Simone Handy has been one of Loyola Marymount's breakout performers this year as she has been upgraded to an everyday starter compared to a season ago when she only started nine of the Lion's 20 games. So far this year Handy has the team-lead in assists with two and one goal of her own to go along with it. She is a very versatile player that Santa Barbara must keep an eye on. For the Gauchos they will continue to count on their two stars, DeWeese and Murison, to continue their consistent production on offense and defense and continue to build on every game as we move closer to conference play.

sports,No. 2 UCSB Men's Water Polo Continues Record-Breaking Run,23-Sep-19,9:15 PM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/no-2-ucsb-mens-water-polo-continues-record-breaking-run/,"Photos Courtesy of Estefani Zuniga What a week for the UCSB men's water polo team! After winning last week against USC for the first time since 1990, the Gauchos jumped from No. 4 to No. 2 in the country. This week the team faced a challenge of a similar stature, and rose to the occasion yet again to maintain a perfect record. The ""òChos had a four-game week, which included a doubleheader on Thursday and two games over the weekend. In Thursday's contests the Gauchos played Ottawa and No. 6 Pepperdine at home. Over the weekend they battled No. 1 Stanford and capped off their road trip against Fresno Pacific.† UCSB began their home doubleheader against Ottawa. The Gauchos jumped out to an 8-0 lead after one and showed no signs of slowing down. The team controlled this game, securing a 14-1 halftime advantage. The second half went much like the first, and UCSB finished with the 19-2 win. The win proved to be record-breaking as it gave the team a 10-0 record for the first time in program history. The Thursday night match turned out to be a thriller when the Gauchos faced off against rival Pepperdine. Like many of their previous matchups, this was a chippy one throughout, as several yellow cards were given and nearly 30 exclusions were drawn between the two teams. Picking things up in the second half, UCSB had a 12-9 lead late in the 4th quarter. When adversity hit the Waves, Pepperdine stayed true to its gritty nature and was able to rally off three goals in the final minutes. This one headed to OT.† The overtime period was utter chaos as the lead changed several times. Pepperdine converted a penalty early in OT to take a 14-13 lead. The Gauchos would respond when reigning GCC player of the week Cole Brosnan was able to find the back of the net. After both teams would convert their next offensive opportunities, the game was tied at 15 apiece. UCSB only had one more opportunity to win this one and they would make the most of it. Coming out of the timeout huddle, it looked as though Head Coach Wolf Wigo drew up a play to get Brosnan a good look at the goal. The ball was thrown to Brosnan and actually was initially stolen. With only a few seconds left on the clock, Brosnan was able to regain control of the ball and launch a backhand from nearly eight meters out. The Pepperdine goalie never saw it coming as it snuck in the corner of the cage. The standing-room-only crowd at Campus Pool erupted as they knew UCSB had won. The Gauchos improved to 11-0 and called it a night before taking off for Stanford the next morning.† Saturday saw the biggest match to date in college water polo, with No. 2 UCSB playing at No. 1 Stanford. UCSB did what they do best and lit up the scoreboard in this one. The Gauchos got two early stops and were able to convert both of those opportunities into goals. The ""òChos were rolling, leading the Cardinal 5-1 after the first period. Junior attacker Leo Yuno led the way for UCSB, putting away four goals and finding teammates for two assists in the contest.† In the second half, Stanford made a strong run at a comeback, bringing it to 10-7 at one point. But ultimately, it was too much offense for the Gauchos as they would begin to score at will. Sophomore attacker Nathan Puentes had an impressive day as he would put away three goals in the contest. And for the second time in two weeks, UCSB would take down the No. 1 team in the country. This one would end as a 15-10 victory for the Gauchos.† This NorCal road trip concluded with a matchup versus Fresno Pacific. Coming off of a monumental win, the Gauchos rode that momentum into this one. Jumping out to a 7-3 lead after one, UCSB would ultimately coast through the second half, winning 21-7. Freshman attacker Colton Gregory had a promising showing, netting five goals in the match. UCSB now improves to 13-0, setting the school's single-season win streak record. Along with this, UCSB should move up in the ranks to the number one spot in the nation. A truly remarkable feat for a school of Santa Barbara's size.  The Gauchos will head down to Spieker Aquatic Center at UCLA this upcoming weekend to compete in another tournament with the top collegiate teams. The team will be looking for yet another strong showing, this time as the new No. 1.

Ultimately, the Gauchos routed the visitors by a score of 4-0, in a very one-sided affair that saw senior forward Will Baynham's second goal of the season and a career-game for senior midfielder Thibault Candia who went on to score a hat trick.† Following the win over UMBC, the Gauchos now extend their winning streak to four in a row. In addition, this now improves UCSB's overall record on the season to 5-2, or a win percentage of .714.† The combined defensive efforts of UCSB's backline and sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach are also worth highlighting since the team has now earned back-to-back clean sheets ""î with no goals allowed against the opposition in three of their previous four encounters.† It was all Gaucho ball early on into Sunday night's match as UCSB attackers tested the UMBC goalkeeper, Quantrell Jones, several times within the first 15 minutes of play. Then, by the 16th-minute mark, the Retrievers finally found their shooting boots and had their first shot of the match ""î which was blocked.† Only a few minutes had passed before the Gauchos' response, and respond they did as Candia opened up proceedings in the 20th-minute after his cross was deflected into the back of the net by a UMBC defender, thus bringing the score to 1-0 on the night.† A second strike from the Gauchos came soon after as junior forward Rodney Michael forced a headed save from Jones, but the ball rebounded and rolled into the way of an incoming Baynham who then brought the tally to 2-nil. The remainder of the first half of play saw some substitutions from both sides and the first booking of the night which was served to Gaucho senior defender Faouzi Taieb.† Commencing the second half, the home side kept its foot on the pedal and continued to test Jones with shot after shot. Naturally, UCSB's imposed presence within UMBC's 18-yard box was rewarded as the Gauchos were awarded a penalty at the 61st-minute. Once more, Candia was clinical from the spot and netted in his second of the match and extended UCSB's lead to three.† The third goal seemingly sucked the life out of UMBC, but the fourth was truly the nail in the coffin as Candia made two enemy defenders look foolish and put more than enough power on† his shot from a distance to beat the Retrievers' goalkeeper, thus securing his hat trick and UCSB's 4-0 victory at home.† To close out the second, two UMBC players were given yellows and UCSB managed to carry the clean sheet into the final whistle ""î senior forward Ignacio Tellechea was also booked in the 53rd-minute.† Overall, the Gauchos are picking up steam and will hope to carry this momentum into next week's difficult doubleheader.† UCSB travels for an away game at the University of the Pacific this Wednesday, Sept. 25, before hosting No. 1 in the nation Stanford at Harder Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 28; both bouts kick off at 7:00 p.m.†

sports,UCSB Women's Soccer Takes Down LMU for Third Consecutive Win,23-Sep-19,1:05 PM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-soccer-takes-down-lmu-for-third-consecutive-win/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team recorded their third win of the season this past Sunday to put them at an overall record of 3-2-3. Behind a hat trick from senior forward Shaelan Murison, Santa Barbara was able to find the back of the net four times to give them a comfortable win over Loyola Marymount. 

Loyola Marymount entered this game winless and on a four-game losing streak, putting them at an overall record 0-7-2. It has been a disappointing season thus far for the Lions as the team has been unable to form an identity on the offensive end of the field. With an extremely young team, Loyola Marymount has steadily gotten better in terms of their chemistry as they look to improve every game. 

UC Santa Barbara started off with an intense amount of pressure early on as the squad looked to cause turnovers in the Lion's half of the field. Santa Barbara was able to score in just fifteen minutes as Murison scored her first goal off of a lead pass from junior forward Isabella Viana. Viana has played well as of late, as it seems that she is stepping up in terms of being a playmaker on the offensive end of the field. 

Murison would score her second goal in the 24th minute and third goal in the 56th minute of the contest to complete her hat trick. This was an encouraging sight for the Gauchos as despite Murison finishing all three goals, the goals were assisted by three different players. UCSB has struggled to find players to emerge on the offensive side of the field next to Murison but that narrative seems to be changing. 

Loyola Marymount was able to get on the board in the 66th minute of the contest as sophomore forward Sydney Schultz netted her first goal of the season. Just five minutes later, junior midfielder Olivia LaCasto scored to get the Lions within one goal of tying the ball game. Throughout their season, the Lions have struggled to finish their opportunities inside the penalty box. 

UCSB would put the game away with a goal from Viana putting the ""òChos up 4-2 in the 89th minute, effectively putting the game out of reach. Although the game became close toward the end, it was an overall solid performance from the young team that has aspirations for a Big West title. 

Santa Barbara has seemed to have caught fire as of late as the squad is now riding a two-game win streak in which the team has outscored its opponents by two and a half goals. Much of this can be attributed to not only the improved offensive play but the steady play of senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese. DeWeese's confidence and quick hands combined with the Gauchos' stout defenders has led to an extremely formidable defense as a whole. 

With just two games left until conference play begins, UCSB will need to keep up their high level of play in order to hit the ground running in their first interconference matchup, which is just a couple weeks away. 

In order for the Gauchos to continue the success that they have been having as of late, it will be crucial for the squad to remain poised and continue to persevere even when facing adversity. For younger teams, it is more difficult in general but there are seniors on the roster who can ensure that the team remains calm in those moments. 

Santa Barbara is back in action this Thursday against Santa Clara in an away game at 7:00 p.m. where the Gauchos will look to add on to their two-game win streak against a very talented Broncos squad.

sports,UCSB Women's Volleyball Looks to Keep Eight-Game Win Streak Alive,23-Sep-19,7:10 PM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-23/ucsb-womens-volleyball-looks-to-keep-eight-game-win-streak-alive/,"Torrie Glasker prepares to spike the ball against Hawaii. Nexus File Photo The UCSB women's volleyball team will play Cal State Northridge, UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton after having defeated both UCLA (3-0) and Pepperdine (3-2) this past weekend.† UCSB swept UCLA last Wednesday on the back of Lindsey Ruddins, who continues to dominate offensively.† Ruddins posted 17 kills against the Bruins and added another 19 in Friday's win over Pepperdine.†† Unlike UCLA, who hadn't lost to UCSB in 21 years, Pepperdine had much more success. The Waves actually won the first two sets (25-17, 25-20) before the Gauchos caught fire, winning three straight (25-23, 25-20, 15-12).† In fact, prior to their matchup, only three teams had won two or more sets against the Gauchos this season. Wyoming won sets two and three before conceding the fourth and fifth while VCU also lost the fourth and fifth sets after going up 2-1. Aside from the loss to Colorado back in August, the Gauchos have began to truly separate themselves from the teams that are simply good, and they are becoming great.† UCSB will face off against CSUN this Tuesday in what should be a tough matchup, but nevertheless, should end in a win. CSUN is 5-7 on the season, but are in the midst of a remarkable turnaround that has seen them win five of their last seven games and four of their last five.† The Matadors are led by sophomore Seyvion Waggoner and her 172 kills. It is hard to believe that CSUN has even lost seven games considering the depth of their lineup. Ruddins currently leads UCSB in kills with 188, but second place Tallulah Froley has 104, far off from Nicole Nevarez, who is second on the Matadors with 123. CSUN is right on par with the Gauchos as their top three in digs have posted 166, 123 and 115, barely shy of Zoe Fleck, Torre Glasker and Ruddins, who have posted 166, 133 and 108 respectively.† If this matchup is anything like the statistics, expect long sets and devastating kills.† The Gauchos will travel to UC Irvine on Friday to face what should be one of their less difficult matchups of the season having lost both fixtures against the Anteaters last season.† The Anteaters have stumbled out of the gate to a 3-9 record, including three losses in their last four games. They were swept by Pepperdine just last week, a team the Gauchos took down just a few days ago. If that's not a telling sign of what's to come, I don't know what is.† Ruddins posted a combined 44 kills in the two games against UCI last year including a double-double in both kills and digs (23, 18) at the Thunderdome. She'll be looking to continue her hot streak against a very beatable team.† Standout performers for the Anteaters last year include Ali Koumelis and Haley Desales, who have since graduated.† While the Anteaters were able to pull away with two wins in two games against the Gauchos last season, they've been forced to shuffle their lineup while the Gauchos have seemingly done nothing but strengthen theirs.† UCSB will hit the road again where they will face Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. Fullerton's 7-3 record in their last 10 is perhaps a bit kind. They've lost two of their last four, including a sweep by North Texas, after having only lost back in August. Further, both of those two wins were reverse sweeps, suggesting that the Gauchos should be able to capitalize early.† The difference between this season and last for UCSB is how clinical they've been. This season has shown us that the Gauchos aren't too happy about being down in a match, that they've rallied from behind to win and that they've shut down opponents without fear.† A quick recap of last week's matches would show that UCSB sophomore Olivia Lovenberg has continued to impress, posting 24 and 27 assists against UCLA and Pepperdine respectively, while Romoni Vivao was not far behind with 18 and 24. The Gauchos also posted 109 digs over the two games and once again proved they can hold their focus. Look for a composed Gaucho team to show up and play.† UCSB will take on CSUN Tuesday night at 7:00 p.m. while games against UCI and Fullerton will kickoff Friday and Saturday at 7:00 and 5:00 p.m. respectively.

sports,Gauchos Head North Looking To Build Up Win Streak,26-Sep-19,10:20 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-26/gauchos-head-north-looking-to-build-up-win-streak/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus Now on a two-game winning streak, the 3-2-3 Gauchos will head up to the Bay Area on Thursday to take on the 4-5 Broncos of Santa Clara.† After a somewhat slow start to the season, the UCSB women's soccer team has lost only one of their last five contests and their last two wins came in a rather convincing fashion.†† This improved stretch of play for the Gauchos is largely due to the play of senior Shaelan Murison, who notched four goals and two assists over the last two games and was awarded with the Big West Conference Athlete of the Week award. Murison currently leads the Big West in goals, and she is tied for fourth in assists. Murison's play on the offensive end is key for the Gauchos to win games and her elevated play over this improved stretch for the team only proves that point even more.† Junior forward Isabella Viana is the other Gaucho along with Murison to have recorded a goal in each of the past two games; the two goals are also the first two scores in her Gaucho career. Over the last four games the Gaucho defense has been stellar and put the team in a position to win every game. The defense is spearheaded by senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese, who is currently fourth in the Big West with a .771 save percentage and fifth with 27 total saves. DeWeese has also been a catalyst for UCSB's recent success by posting a .8 goals-against average over the last five games, lower than her overall season average of .92.† This is a great time of the year for the ""òChos to hit their stride as a team with conference play on the horizon. They will want to be running on all cylinders by the time they have to face their Big West rivals. However, until conference play officially begins, the UCSB women's soccer team must take things one game at a time, and that means putting their entire focus into what will be a difficult road matchup against Santa Clara. Don't let the sub-.500 record fool you; Santa Clara is a talented team that has played a very difficult schedule to start the season. The Broncos were picked to finish first along with BYU in the WCC preseason poll this year, which makes sense because they are returning six All-WCC players from a year ago, including the reigning WCC player of the year in senior Kelcie Hedge.† But even with all the returning talent, the Broncos' star player so far this season has been freshman Izzy D'Aquila, whose eight goals on the season ranks 13th in the country and second among freshmen. D'Aquila has scored a goal in six of her team's nine games this season and recorded multiple goals in two of those six games, good for an incredible start to her freshman campaign. Not far behind D'Aquila is junior Kelsey Turnbow, who has six goals and six assists so far in 2019. Turnbow and D'Aquila are by far the team's scoring leaders for the Broncos, but what makes this team especially difficult to handle is the multitude of other capable playmakers they have on the roster, with six other players having recorded a goal in the team's first nine games. Santa Clara's deep and talented roster will pose a unique challenge for the Gauchos, which means Santa Barbara will have to make the most of their opportunities on offense while also limiting the scoring chances for the Broncos on the other end. The Gauchos and Broncos will face off in Santa Clara on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m.

Nexus File Photo. The No. 1 UCSB men's water polo team travels south this weekend to Spieker Aquatic Center at UCLA to compete in the SoCal Invitational. The three-day series of games begins this Friday when the team takes on No. 20 San Jose State. The Gauchos' opponent in their succeeding games will be determined based off of Friday's first match. San Jose State (SJSU) will be coming into this match looking to pull off a huge upset. The Spartans enter the contest with a 2-6 regular season record but are trending upwards with wins in their last two matchups against Whittier College and Ottawa University ""ì Arizona.† UCSB will be trying to continue its historic run. The team currently holds an astounding 13-0 record and has claimed the No. 1 spot in the national rankings for the first time since 1979.† To reach this point, Santa Barbara has been eliminating top teams weekly and climbing the ranks the entire season. They started off their 2019 campaign as the No. 7 team in the nation. Since those preseason ranks were released, they have beaten Cal to move to No. 4, knocked off USC to move up to No. 2 and eliminated Stanford to claim the No. 1 spot.† The Gauchos have been firing on all cylinders as a team this 2019 season and will look to continue this unified style of play this weekend. Senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic has remained lights out on the defensive end of the pool this season, kickstarting the team's fast-paced offensive attack by getting stops on the other side of the pool. The offense, which has scored goals in bunches this season, is propelled by junior attacker Cole Brosnan who has been scoring at will as of late. Brosnan was named Golden Coast Conference Player of the Week, as well as Santa Barbara Athletic Roundtable Athlete of the Week for his remarkable play as of late.† Potential opponents for UCSB in the later rounds of the invitational include No. 6 Pepperdine, No. 7 UC Berkeley and No. 3 Stanford, all teams that the Gauchos have beaten so far this season. One particularly intriguing potential matchup could be the No. 2 UCLA Bruins, who are seemingly the only top team that UCSB hasn't defeated during their record-breaking run. The Bruins are currently undefeated, coming into the invitational with a perfect 6-0 record, as well as an unofficial win over The Olympic Club earlier this year. The Gauchos are scheduled to take them on Oct. 11 but we could be looking at an earlier matchup between these two titans if they both advance deep in the invitational this weekend. The SoCal Invitational will be full of top teams from around California. Santa Barbara will come into this stacked tourney with a new test in front of them, playing as the No. 1 team in the nation. The first game of the tournament kicks off at 4:40 p.m. in LA. If you can't make it to Southern California to support UCSB, you can tune into TheFosh.net for the play by play and score updates.†

The Gauchos hung tight for the first half, but they were unable to keep the Broncos in check as two second-half goals by Izzy D'Aquila were enough to put the game away for the home team.† The game started out evenly matched and both teams had opportunities to score and get on the board first. At the end of the first half, UCSB had six shots and Santa Clara had taken seven, but neither team was able to find the back of the net. It was in the second half when freshman midfielder D'Aquila scored her 9th and tenth goals of the season in a three-minute span to ultimately put the game out of reach for the Gauchos. D'Aquila's goals were assisted by Kelsey Turnbow and Alex Loera. Broncos goalie Courtney Ogren also contributed to the win with three saves, good enough for her third complete game shutout of the season. The Broncos were able to put up 11 shots in the second half of play which dwarfed the three shots taken by the Gauchos. Santa Clara's relentless offensive attack coupled with their defense locking down and limiting opportunities in the second half is what separated them from UCSB and ultimately decided the outcome in this one. Shaelan Murison led the way for the Gauchos offensively with six total shots including one shot on goal, and Hanna DeWeese turned in another stellar performance, racking up six saves on the day. After falling back to .500, the Gauchos will hit the road again for their next matchup. This time they will face Cal State Bakersfield in their final game of the non-conference season.† The Roadrunners are 5-4-1 on the year and looking to bounce back from a loss on Sunday to Sacramento State.† CSUB is lead by senior Sophie Freeman and junior Eszter Toth, who both have three goals so far this season. Senior Aryana Harvey has yet to score but she does lead the team in assists with four. The Roadrunners also have a stellar freshman duo in Jaden Skinner and Chelsee Duran, who have each put the ball in the net twice. Bakersfield has found success this year behind an offensive attack constituting of many capable playmakers so they are not forced to rely on one single person every game. CSUB has managed to stay above .500 without scoring more than two goals in any game so far this year, which means they score goals when it's necessary and then they can protect their lead very well. Junior Andrea Neves has started nine of the 10 games as goalkeeper for the Roadrunners and she has allowed 13 in those nine games, good for a .717 save percentage on the season. This is a game where UCSB should look to attack early and get on the board so Bakersfield is forced to play from behind, and they cannot just sit back and protect their lead like they have before. It will be important for the Gauchos to spread the attack and get many of their players involved with their offensive attack. It can't just be Murison who takes all the offensive responsibility, because the ""òChos are at their best when everyone is getting chances to score. This game is another road test and an opportunity for UCSB to gain some momentum and be above .500 heading into Big West Conference play.† The Gauchos will face the Roadrunners on Sunday in Bakersfield at 12:00 p.m.

The team shut out Pacific by a score of 2-0 behind goals from Australians Finn Ballard-McBride and Will Baynham. The win boosted UCSB's overall record to 6-2 and its win-streak to a whopping five games. Looking ahead, on Saturday, the Gauchos will face their biggest test of the season against the highest-ranked program in the nation ""î No. 1 Stanford.† So far, Stanford has truly merited the No. 1 in the nation spot when looking at their overall performance on the year. The Cardinals boast an unblemished record of 7-0 on the season. At first glance, much of these results can be attributed to Stanford's repertoire as a goal-scoring machine, but it should also be noted they've allowed only two goals throughout the entire season. Stanford will be coming off their seventh win after defeating San Jose State by 3-0 on Tuesday. So a weekend upset, courtesy of the Gauchos, would be momentous ""î to say the least.† Stanford enters this one with both an immediate and historical advantage, as the Gauchos trail the Cardinals with an all-time series record of 6-14-2. However, UCSB was victorious when these two teams last met back in 2015, when the Gauchos hosted a 1-0 win at Harder Stadium.† Ones to watch for the Gauchos include senior midfielder Thibault Candia and senior forward Sahid Conteh.† Candia enters this week on fire after scoring a hat trick against UMBC last Sunday; because of this, he was named the Big West Co-Offensive Player of the Week. Candia now has a team-leading four goals to his name, as well as two assists which also places him tied for team-leading in playmaking.† Conteh continues his fine form after earning an assist last time out, which ended up being the set up to Candia's third goal of that game. With a goal on the season and also tied with a team-leading two assists, Conteh's dynamism will play a pivotal role in this week's doubleheader.† Players to look out for on the Stanford team are freshman forward Gabe Segal and senior midfielder Derek Waldeck. Segal leads all Cardinals in scoring with his four goals on the season, whilst Waldeck leads in playmaking with four assists. With two goals for Waldeck as well, he and Segal have both managed to fill up the stat sheets week in and week out; the Gauchos will definitely pay special attention to these two and will plan accordingly to cope with Stanford's explosive offense.† UCSB hosts No. 1 Stanford on Saturday, Sept. 28. The matchup is set with a 7 p.m. kickoff time.

CSUN also managed to win two sets, but were eventually shut down by this season's new-look Gauchos who seem hungrier than ever. The matchup against CSUN was the start of conference play and was also UCSB's ninth straight victory to give them an overall record of 11-1 on the season, an outstanding feat considering last year's team didn't win their 11th game until the 16th game of the season and had a season-high win streak of just four games. UCI (3-10) will host UCSB† this Friday in an attempt to right the ship before it's too late for the Anteaters, if it isn't already. The Anteaters did manage to win both games against the Gauchos last season, though they saw five players graduate all while UCSB has seemingly evolved into a clinical powerhouse. UCI is currently coming off a rough stretch of games that saw them lose four of their last five, including three sweeps by Loyola Chicago (7-6), Pepperdine (5-7), who the Gauchos of course just defeated, and most recently, Boise State (9-3). While losses against Loyola Chicago and Boise can be expected given the loss of talent UCI has experienced, the sweep by Pepperdine highlights the stark gap in talent and experience. The Gauchos will look for their tenth straight win in this matchup. Lindsey Ruddins posted 23 and 21 kills in each of last year's matchups against UCI and will be looking to stay in phenomenal form. The Gauchos will be hoping to dominate this game and any expectations of less are simply asinine. After Friday's match against UCI, UCSB will travel to Cal State Fullerton (8-4), who have split their last six matches dating back to Sept. 12. The Titans are led by standout freshman Julia Crawford who, in just her first season, has managed 171 kills up to this point to lead her team. She also just so happens to be second on her team with 131 digs, a ways away from junior Savahna Costello's 259, but nevertheless a showcase of her athleticism as an outside hitter. So while the Gauchos possess superior depth at the top end in terms of digs, the Titans will be playing Costello, whose 259 dig count clearly tops UCSB's Zoe Fleck's 182. The Titans' ability to extend plays is showcased no better than by the fact that they have recorded nearly 200 more digs than the Gauchos up to this point.† The Gauchos will have to capitalize on chances if they are to return home with a win. While Fullerton has greatly benefited from, or perhaps have been carried by, Crawford, she also leads the team in errors with 56. While Ruddins, Crawford's opposite, also leads her team in errors, her superior hitting percentage (.250 vs .217) suggests that not only has Ruddins been far more efficient, but that pressuring Crawford may be key to winning this matchup. On the topic of errors, freshman Gaucho Romoni Vivao has STILL not committed a single error. While she is one of two main setters for UCSB, with sophomore Olivia Lovenberg in the midst of a spectacular follow-up to her freshman year, she is simply not responsible for racking up kills. For the Titans, both Makenzi Abelman and Elizabeth Schuster have combined for 10 errors thus far, five times Lovenberg's two. Overall, this should be an exciting weekend for the Gauchos who will have two very different matchups that will ultimately teach us a lot about this team. After winning both of last season's meetings with UCSB, UCI has suffered from a mass exodus of talent while the Gauchos have just simply gotten better. Cal State Fullerton, on the other hand, has had more gas pumped in the tank thanks to the arrival of freshman phenom Crawford. Their 8-4 record is respectable and for a program that's been as strong as theirs, they'll be looking to compete.† UCI will host UCSB at 7:00 p.m. Friday night while Saturday's match at Cal State Fullerton will kick off at 5:00 p.m.

sports,"Gauchos Take Down UCI And CSUF, Extend Win Streak To 11",29-Sep-19,3:45 PM,['Nithesh Perumal'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-29/gauchos-take-down-uci-and-csuf-extend-win-streak-to-11/,"Nexus File Photo With back-to-back wins against UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton, the UCSB women's volleyball team push their win streak to 11 straight games ""î improving to 13-1 on the season.† The team's two-game road stint started at UC Irvine on Thursday. The Anteaters kept the first set close at 21-19, before the ""òChos overwhelmed the Irvine team with 4 straight points. After this point UC Irvine took themselves out of the game as their errors compounded one after the other leading to an almost effortless 25-11 second set win for the ""òChos. While the Anteaters got less and less efficient as the match progressed from the first to the second set, the ""òChos did the opposite, winning the hitting percentage battle .304 to .051 on the night.† In a league with as high parity as the Big West, it's very difficult and next to impossible to win any game hitting as poorly as .051, especially against a UCSB team who has cemented their place as one of the premier blocking teams and the most efficient hitting offenses in the country.† After getting down 2-1 the Anteaters made a valiant comeback and had the game tied at 20-20 in the third set. Ultimately they were not able to convert and allowed the ""òChos to end the set with a 5-1 run to complete the sweep. In the third set in particular, senior Lindsey Ruddins made her presence felt with a solo block, a kill and a joint block with Rowan Ennis to end the game. This game was also highlighted by a balanced setting effort by both Olivia Lovenberg and Romoni Vivao, who had 20 and 17 assists respectively. With nearly all cogs off the offense working at maximum capacity and Irvine making as many errors as they did, the Gauchos pushed their win streak to 11 straight games and aimed to carry this momentum over to their game against Cal State Fullerton the next day. The ""òChos ran away with the game against Fullerton from the start. The closest the game was was 3-3 in the first set, but after a quick 5-0 run the ""òChos went on to close out the first set 25-15. Fullerton was unable to hit efficiently, similar to Irvine, and also was unable to keep up with the ""òChos offense. Fullerton outside Julia Crawford logged 11 kills but with the all-around offensive output of the ""òChos, her 11 kills were not enough to offset the Gaucho efficiency. The ""òChos hit .321 to Fullerton's .032 and were thus blown out every set (the lowest point differential being 8).† A recurring theme for this Gaucho team is the extremely efficient hitting. With such a star-studded offense, opponents can seldom hope to negatively influence the UCSB hitting squad ""î and are thus required to try to match the offensive output themselves to have a shot at winning. It's hard enough to match the scoring output of a star player like Ruddins, but factoring in the bench depth and next to flawless setting ""î it's almost impossible.† As long as both Lovenberg and Vivao keep playing as well as they have, the ""òChos are head and shoulders above almost any opposition. Tallying 21 and 19 assists respectively, this setting duo has done a phenomenal job at running the offense and continue to excel. The ""òChos will definitely be coming back Friday, Oct. 4, with a lot of confidence for their game against UC Davis and look to extend their win streak even further to 12 straight.†

sports,UCSB Men's Soccer Ties No. 1 Stanford 3-3,29-Sep-19,5:14 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-29/ucsb-mens-soccer-ties-no-1-stanford-3-3/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB men's soccer team was six minutes away from taking down the top team in the country, but a late defensive mishap eventually led to a 3-3 tie against the No.1 Stanford Cardinal. The Gauchos pushed their no-loss streak to six, and now stand at a 6-2-1 overall record. The Cardinal still have yet to lose on the season and are now at 7-0-1 after the draw. Although Stanford came into this match as the undisputed best team in the nation, it was actually UCSB who dominated from the opening kick. The Gauchos were on the attack early, testing the Cardinal backline with two good looks in the first 13 minutes. Just 14 minutes in, UCSB was awarded two consecutive corner kicks following a Will Baynham shot on goal. Senior midfielder Thibault Candia curled the ball into the box for the second corner, and as players from both teams descended on the ball it was freshman Finn Ballard McBride who got to it first for the Gauchos, backheeling it past the Stanford goalkeeper to put UCSB up 1-0. To say that this early goal was surprising would be an understatement. The Cardinal had only trailed for 30 minutes out of the previous 630 that they had played, and they had given up a total of two goals prior to this matchup. The Gauchos would double that total just five minutes later, when forward Baynham headed home an Ignacio Tellechea free kick in the 19th minute to put UCSB up 2-0.† As the half wore on, both teams began to get into their offensive rhythms. Stanford in particular started to pass the ball around and open up the Gaucho defense, but if the backline just continued to hold their own and limit any mistakes UCSB had a great chance to take its lead into the halftime break. Unfortunately the Gauchos made a crucial mental mistake with just three minutes to go into the half, sending up numbers trying to score a third goal which left them vulnerable to a counter-attack. Stanford forward Ousseni Bouda took the ball down the length of the pitch and sent in a cross from the right wing which dropped right around the penalty spot. Because UCSB had sent so many players up the field, there were no defenders around to clear the ball, and junior forward Arda Bulut had a wide open shot on goal which he put in the back of the net. Although UCSB was essentially playing with house money at this point, it still was disappointing for the team to give up a goal when they just had to hold strong for a few more minutes. ""úIf we had gone into the half up 2-0 it would have obviously been better in terms of trying to win the game,""ù Coach Vom Steeg pointed out postgame.† Stanford came out strong to start off the second half, searching for an equalizer. The Cardinal would get it just two and a half minutes into the period, when defender Keegan Hughes charged through the Gaucho defense unmarked to head home a Logan Panchot corner kick. There's a reason that a 2-0 lead is known as the worst lead to have in a soccer game, because as the Gauchos learned the hard way, once the opposing team scores one goal, another one usually follows closely behind. This shift in momentum could have proved fatal for UCSB if it was a lesser team, but the squad's star power is what kept them in the game. And in the 62nd minute it was the star junior Rodney Michael who came through for the Gauchos as he has so many times before. After a Baynham shot that was blocked by the Stanford goalie, Michael received the ball at the top of the box, did a quick dribble move to get the ball to his right foot and rocketed the ball into the back of the net giving UCSB the 3-2 lead. It was at this point that the energy of the packed crowd at Harder Stadium reached its peak, and there seemed to be a great chance for the Gauchos to finish the job and give Stanford its first loss of the season. UCSB was able to hold strong all the way until the 85th minute, when redshirt sophomore Zach Ryan received a cross in the box and passed it over to fellow Cardinal Charlie Wehan who knocked the ball in for his second goal of the year.† It was a tough end to regulation for the Gauchos who had fought so hard to maintain their lead. ""úIt was really frustrating because obviously the whole team had battled so hard to get to that point where we were in the lead,""ù Michael said after the game. ""úIt was just those last five minutes that we weren't able to pull through.""ù The game then went into overtime, where both teams had chances to score that they couldn't put away. The most impactful event of the whole game actually came at the end of the first overtime, however, when UCSB senior defender Faouzi Taieb broke his leg after a collision in the box. Taieb was the team's rock on defense, and losing him with an already depleted defensive backline will be tough for the Gauchos to recover from moving forward. ""úAll in all it was a great effort from our guys. It is a positive result in terms of where we were,""ù Coach Vom Steeg said after the game. ""úBut [the team is] really disappointed about what happened to our star defender.""ù

sports,No. 1 UCSB Men's Water Polo Finishes Fourth at SoCal Invitational,30-Sep-19,3:14 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-09-30/no-1-ucsb-mens-water-polo-finishes-fourth-at-socal-invitational/,"Photo Courtesy of Estefani Zuniga After almost a month of running roughshod through collegiate water polo, the UCSB men's water polo team finally met their match last weekend at the SoCal Invitational. The Gauchos, who came into the tournament as the No. 1 team in the country, won their first two games of the tournament against No. 20 San Jose State and No. 6 Pepperdine before falling to both No. 2 UCLA and No. 4 Pacific in their final two games. The 2-2 split dropped UCSB to 15-2 this season and garnered the team a fourth-place finish in the Invitational. UCSB handled San Jose State with some ease in their 11-5 victory on Friday. The Gauchos never trailed, posting three early goals to jump out ahead in the first quarter, and then four straight goals at the end of the third and the start of the fourth to more or less seal the game. Senior driver Tommy Fellner notched two of those four late goals, and had a team-leading three goals in the game. Three different Gauchos ""î junior attacker Cole Brosnan, senior attacker Jacob Halle and sophomore driver Nathan Puentes ""î had two goals as the team showed off a wide array of firepower. Saturday morning's game against Pepperdine was UCSB's third matchup this season with the Waves, and their third victory. The previous game between the two was a 16-15 overtime nailbiter, but Saturday's 14-10 Gaucho win was much more sedate. Neither team was able to gain an edge in the first quarter, a high-scoring affair that ended with the Gauchos up 5-4. UCSB rattled the cage another five times in the second quarter against just two Pepperdine goals, which set the Gauchos up with a commanding lead they would never relinquish. The Waves kept fighting in the second half, but each Pepperdine goal was eventually answered by a UCSB tally. Senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic's two goals in the fourth quarter kept the Waves at bay, and, along with a first quarter tally, gave Gvozdanovic a hat trick. It was another balanced offensive performance for the Gauchos. Brosnan and Halle both scored twice again, and were joined in that category by sophomore driver Ryan Brosnan and junior attacker Leo Yuno. Junior defender Mason McQuet was a menace defensively with four steals and also handed out three assists, both team-leading tallies. Later that same day, the Gauchos took on UCLA and lost their first game of the season. UCSB never led, but also never trailed by more than two goals in the back-and-forth 9-8 loss. The Bruins scored first with a crucial first-strike just three minutes into the game. The Gauchos responded a few minutes later, but were never able to plant themselves in the driver's seat of the match. A UCLA goal from sophomore attacker Ashworth Molthen put the Bruins up 6-5 with two seconds left on the clock in the first half, and the two teams simply traded goals after that point. It was largely a defensive struggle, with only six goals total in the second half. Yuno scored midway through the fourth quarter to tie the game at eight apiece, but the Gauchos were unable to break the deadlock in their favor after that. It was another goal from Molthen, instead, that pushed the Bruins ahead one last time with under a minute left in the fourth. Gvozdanovic was again crucial to UCSB's performance, but in a very different way; the senior dished out three assists and tallied five steals against the Bruins. Sam Nangle led the Gauchos with two goals, while redshirt freshman goalkeeper Danny Roland made seven saves and snatched up three steals. The Gauchos closed up their SoCal Invitational with another tough loss, this one a tough 11-10 upset at the hands of Golden Coast Conference rivals University of the Pacific. Once again, UCSB never led but instead played catch-up all game. The Tigers by and large controlled the match from the jump with a 3-1 opening quarter, but UCSB kept them honest with four goals in the second to trim the lead to 6-5 heading into halftime. Pacific managed to stay at least a step ahead throughout the third period, relying on Jeremie Cote and his three third-period goals. Down 10-8 with just over three minutes to go, the Gauchos launched one last attempt at victory. Yuno and Cole scored back-to-back goals to finally even the ledger and give UCSB a shot at a comeback. One last Pacific goal, however, shut the comeback down with 1:04 to go in the fourth. The Gauchos were unable to muster another response, and earned their second-straight loss. Yuno and Cole both scored hat tricks and together accounted for more than half of UCSB's offensive output, a somewhat unusual result for the team. Gvozdanovic again led the team in steals with three, but no other Gaucho was able to do much to inhibit the Tigers' attack. UCSB hosts USC on Sunday at Campus Pool in their second meeting of the year. The Gauchos will look to reprise their earlier 13-9 victory when the game kicks off at 12:00 p.m.

sports,Blue-Green Rivalry Part I : No. 18 UCSB Set To Host Cal Poly,3-Oct-19,5:30 AM,"['Richard Benites', 'Omar Hernandez']",https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/blue-green-rivalry-part-i-no-18-ucsb-set-to-host-cal-poly/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The Gauchos continue their climb up the polls after once again going the distance with a nationally ranked team following a 2-2 tie in double overtime versus No. 25 San Diego. With this most recent result occurring on the road, the No. 18 UCSB Gauchos remain with zero losses on their away record and most importantly continue their undefeated streak of seven matches. Entering Tuesday night's game, the Toreros were staring at the chance to make it three consecutive wins before the Gauchos spoiled the party. The match began and ended as another heated affair as sophomore defender Ryan Johnson earned UCSB its first of four yellow cards on the night in the 23rd minute of play. Nearing the end of the first half, the Gauchos were the first to strike after junior forward Ameyawu Muntari found the back of the net off an assist by senior midfielder Thibault Candia. Seconds before the whistle, Candia then closed out the first half as the game's second player to be painted yellow.† It didn't take San Diego very long into the second half to respond as their junior midfielder, Ross Meldrum, brought the score to one-all at the 48th minute. The night's third goal then came minutes later as the home side took the lead in the 53rd thanks to senior midfielder Freddy Polzer. Following this, the Gauchos picked up the intensity and brought it back to two apiece off a score from junior forward Rodney Michael in the 63rd minute; senior forward Will Baynham was the provider on this play after being awarded a yellow card minutes prior. Michael's goal ended up being the decider as neither team could manage a third goal and the result was shared 2-2 after going to double overtime.† After also tying against No. 1 Stanford just the weekend before, UCSB fans were right in their hope of a potential national ranking as the Gauchos are now considered a top-25 team in the country according to Top Drawer Soccer. UCSB also received votes in the NCAA United Soccer Coaches' poll for Division 1 men's soccer. It doesn't stop here, however, as the next goal is for UCSB to be ranked within the top 25 programs in the nation in all official rankings ""î with the next obstacle in their way being a certain Blue-Green rival, Cal Poly.† With all the momentum in their favor as they find themselves in the midst of an undefeated streak of seven straight, UCSB enter this one at an overall record of 6-2-2 on the season ""î a win percentage of .700. Although the home-side favorites, the Gauchos know that this rivalry is never an easy task and will surely show their best form to the fans at Harder Stadium on Saturday night.† As for Cal Poly, the Mustangs maintain an overall record of 4-3-1, a win percentage of .563. Even with the visitors' recent string of favorable results, Cal Poly are still without a win when playing on the road.† The Gauchos hold the historical advantage in this one as UCSB leads in the all-time series with a record of 47-20-10 over Cal Poly. Last season, both teams split even as the Mustangs won their home game by a score of 1-0 and the Gauchos were victorious in the more recent match with a 2-0 result at Harder Stadium.† With a goal in back to back games, Rodney Michael will be one to watch as he now holds two goals and two assists to his name. Candia and Baynham both remain at the top of productivity as the pair have a team-leading four goals and four assists each.† Emmanuel Perez is the danger man for Cal Poly, as the junior midfielder boasts a team-leading seven goals for the Mustangs ""î along with two assists.† His partner in the midfield is the Mustang captain, Diego Alonso, who just recently returned from injury and has already made a huge impact on the team's playstyle. The Berkeley native already leads the team in assists with three in just six games and has re-energized a Cal Poly offense that was sputtering at the beginning of the season. Alonso scored the game-winner against the Gauchos in their first matchup last season, almost exactly a year ago to this date, so the depleted UCSB backline will have to keep an eye on him at all times on Saturday night. The key to this game will be, and has always been, which team can dominate the physical facet of the match. These two teams rarely produce beautiful games when they meet up, but they are always memorable. Players on both teams harp on the fact that strategy goes out the window during rivalry games, and while the home crowd certainly pumps up the Gauchos it will have the same effect on the Mustangs as well. It's time to claim bragging rights in the biggest college rivalry in soccer ""î at least until these teams meet again on month from now. The Blue-Green Rivalry kicks off this Saturday, Oct. 5 at 7 p.m. as UCSB hosts Cal Poly at Harder Stadium.†

Santa Barbara is coming off a win against CSU Bakersfield where the ""òChos were able to blank the Roadrunners and win by a commanding three goals. Long Beach State has struggled early on this season. The 49ers enter this game with an overall record of 2-7. In the most recent matchup against BYU, Long Beach State was unable to find any sort of rhythm on the offensive end of the field as the team only mustered seven shots, with only two of them on goal. Moreover, their defense was unable to make the Cougars uncomfortable as the 49ers gave up three goals as well. That being said, Long Beach State is still a very young team which consists of only three seniors. As the season goes on, the team will surely gain more chemistry and could potentially compete for the Big West title. Offensively, junior forward Kaylee Ramirez leads the way for the 49ers offensively with two goals on the year. Junior goalkeeper Marta Alemany Sanchez anchors the defense with a total of 29 saves and a save percentage of 74.4%. Santa Barbara was able to win fairly comfortably against CSU Bakersfield last game as the Gauchos were able to keep the Roadrunners from finding the back of the net. Three different players were able to score a goal for UCSB, giving the team a lot of confidence heading into this upcoming matchup. An extremely impressive statistic from the CSU Bakersfield game was the fact that senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese did not have to record a single save. With consistent pressure from Santa Barbara, the Roadrunners were not able to get behind the defense which allowed DeWeese to be extremely comfortable in front of the net. DeWeese has been one of the best players in the lineup as she now has five clean sheets on the year. One of the main struggles that the Gauchos have had this season is an inability to find the back of the net consistently. Santa Barbara took a step in the right direction in their past game as senior forward Shaelan Murison was not the only player to score for UCSB. By having a couple players that can consistently score goals for the Gauchos, this will allow Murison to have more space in the penalty box without getting double teamed. With their upcoming matchup against the 49ers, it will be crucial for the Gauchos to continue to keep everything in front of them on the defensive end. Much of their success this season has come from pressuring opposing teams into turnovers so the team can use them to get on the transition attack. By attacking in the transition, it allows the ""òChos to attack opposing defenses while they are not set. In order to ensure that the Gauchos can compete for the Big West title over the next couple of weeks, another important factor will be limiting the amount of fouls the team commits over the course of the game. When the team commits numerous fouls, primary in the first half, it tends to set the tone for the entire game, which leaves them unable to find a rhythm on both sides of the ball. UCSB is back in action this Sunday against Long Beach State at home inside of Harder Stadium at 1 p.m., where the Gauchos will look to start conference play with a victory.

sports,No. 5 Men's Water Polo Hopes To Bounce Back Vs. USC,3-Oct-19,5:06 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-03/no-5-mens-water-polo-hopes-to-bounce-back-vs-usc/,"Ivan Gvozdanovic aims for the goal. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus For the first time this season, the UC Santa Barbara men's water polo team is in need of a bounce-back performance. It's unlikely their next opponent will make it easy on them. The No. 4 Gauchos will host No. 5 USC on Sunday and will enter the match on a two-game losing streak. Those two losses came at the hands of first UCLA and then the University of the Pacific in the team's final games of last weekend's SoCal Invitational. As a result, the 15-2 Gauchos find themselves in unfamiliar territory as they prepare to take on a familiar opponent. UCSB defeated USC a little over two weeks ago at the Inland Empire Classic, a then-surprising upset that snapped a 29-year losing streak against the Trojans. Those Trojans, then, will jump into Campus Pool on Saturday with revenge and a return to the historical order in mind. USC, now 7-2, has rebounded from that earlier loss. The Trojans are 5-1 since then, with wins over No. 6 Cal, No. 8 Long Beach State and No. 18 Princeton. The one blemish came at the hands of Pacific in a 16-15 shootout to open up last weekend's SoCal Invitational. Junior driver Jacob Mercep leads the Trojans with 23 goals so far this year, while senior driver Marin Dasic isn't far behind with 20. Both players have scored multiple times in seven games this season, but only Dasic was able to pull that off against the Gauchos the first time around with two goals in the match. Limiting those two engines of attack again on Sunday will be crucial to a UCSB victory. The Gauchos forced other players to hurt them, and none proved capable of dealing a killing blow. One of those other players was sophomore driver Hannes Daube, who took eight shots in the first matchup, converting only once. Daube is USC's third-leading scorer and has scored in seven different games, so limiting his opportunities will be another Gaucho priority. ""úWe know we need to stop Daube and Mercep,""ù UCSB Head Coach Wolf Wigo said. UCSB will also look to replicate their success against USC's goalkeepers, particularly sophomore Nic Porter. Porter, who boasts 10.29 saves and 9.14 goals allowed per game, was in goal for the first matchup and unable to stop much of what the Gauchos threw at him with just four saves against the 13 goals. The Trojans have largely alternated goalies this season, however, so UCSB may be facing off against junior Vaios Vlahotasios in the cage instead of Porter. Vlahotasios has been less successful statistically with 8.6 saves and 9.2 goals allowed per game and was the main recipient of the Pacific onslaught last season. Whichever Trojan is in goal will be doing his best to prevent a repeat performance by junior attacker Cole Brosnan. Brosnan buried USC with five goals the first time around, including two in the third quarter to help push the Gauchos out to a decisive lead. ""úI am sure they will focus a little more on Cole this time,""ù Wigo said. ""úBut that will just open up our other shooters so we don't have any problem with that.""ù Brosnan has kept up the scoring since the first USC game. The junior scored eight times during the SoCal Invitational, with one goal in each game. ""úCole has a great shot,""ù Wigo said. ""úAnd if you do not mark him tight, he is deadly.""ù The Gauchos will have a home crowd at their backs on Sunday, something they didn't have in La Verne the first time they faced the Trojans. That should provide something of a boost to UCSB, which is 2-0 in Campus Pool so far this season. ""úIt will be a home game with a huge crowd,""ù Wigo said. ""ú ""¶ [We need to] just play relaxed and confident. Let the crowd do what they do and don't get distracted.""ù This UCSB team has never had to overcome defeat and keep moving forward, so Sunday represents a unique challenge. That both losses came by razor-thin margins to elite teams can provide some solace, and Coach Wigo is confident in his team's ability to press on: ""úI think we played great and lost in the final minute by one goal against top teams ""¶ It has not really affected us. We will continue to stay with our game plan and hopefully execute that.""ù On Sunday, the Gauchos will get the chance to prove their coach right.

After having earned her conference record-tying 11th Big West Player of the Week award, Lindsey Ruddins will look to lead the UC Santa Barbara women's volleyball team into this week's matchups against UC Davis and UC Riverside.† UC Davis will almost certainly be the tougher opponent as they currently sit at 10-5 and are coming off three straight wins against San Francisco, UC Irvine and UC Riverside. The Aggies are led by senior outside hitter Lauren Matias who has 192 kills and one less error than Ruddins. While Ruddins has been the more ferocious attacker, Matias in turn has proven to be quite a composed scorer herself. A small but not insignificant lead in hitting percentage means the edge in attack goes to Ruddins and the Gauchos.† Sophomore outside hitter Mahalia White is currently second on the team in kills with 176, a strong lead when compared to the Gauchos' second-leading attacker Tallulah Froley and her 135. The big difference between these teams is in their depth and UCSB junior Rowan Ennis has played her part quite well to say the least, as represented by her 26-kill advantage over Demari Webb's 86. The Gauchos lineup will feature not only the leading scorer but a player in Ennis who has been severely underrated due to Ruddins' phenomenal showing this year.† While the difference in records (13-1, 10-5) suggests UCSB has clearly been the better team, the Aggies have managed to sweep their opponents six times while the Gauchos have done it five times. But taking a closer look will reveal where the difference lies, as UCSB has been far more hungry in games where they were down.† The Aggies have been swept three times this season while the Gauchos have not once. An even closer look into the stats will show you that the Gauchos have won five games after having been down by one or two sets versus the Aggies' one. So while the Aggies do have one more sweep to their name, they've been unable to climb back up when down in games.† Looking back at last year's matchups, the two games were split with Davis taking down Santa Barbara 3-2 while the Gauchos made amends with a 3-1 victory later in the season, yet another example of the Aggies' inability to fight from the bottom.† An upperhand in scoring and scoring depth, hitting percentage, digs and track record all suggest the Gauchos should come out victorious; however, anticipating an easy win would be foolish.† The Gauchos will stay in Santa Barbara where they will host UC Riverside on Saturday, a team that has expectedly stumbled out the gate after a disappointing 4-14 finish in conference last year as well as a 9-19 record overall.† UCSB currently has the upperhand in kills, errors, assists, hitting percentage, service errors, reception errors, digs, every blocks category and total points. Throw in the records and UCSB is the clear favorite in this matchup. They've just been a much better team.† The Gauchos came out on top in both matchups last year including a 3-0 sweep in the latter parts of the season.† The highlight of the Highlanders this season has been freshman Amarachi Osuji whose arrival has translated to a team-leading 144 kills and a fourth-place standing in digs with 90. With two less errors than Ruddins and a measly .183 hitting percentage, she has proven to be an extremely talented player with perhaps too much weight on her shoulders. Don't expect her to steamroll this stout Gaucho defense, but don't be surprised when she shows up ready to win.† The Gauchos will host UC Davis this Friday at 7 p.m. while Saturday's game against UC Riverside will kickoff at 5 p.m., both right here at the Thunderdome.†

sports,No. 18 UCSB Men's Soccer Dominates Rival Cal Poly,6-Oct-19,4:06 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-06/no-18-ucsb-mens-soccer-dominates-rival-cal-poly/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The No. 18 UCSB men's soccer team dominated their Central Coast rival Cal Poly on Saturday night, cruising to a 3-1 victory that kept their eight-game unbeaten streak alive. With the win, the Gauchos moved up to a 7-2-2 overall record, while the Mustangs dropped to 4-4-1 just as conference season is set to get underway. UCSB controlled the ball from the opening kick and seemed to feed off the packed crowd of 9,748 fans who filled Harder Stadium last night.† Just like the team's previous home game against Stanford, the Gauchos came into this matchup ready to attack. They took eight shots in the first 30 minutes of the match, forcing Cal Poly to retreat further and further back to their own side of the pitch.† A large part of this aggressive mindset has to be attributed to the return of defenders Hunter Ashworth and Noah Billingsley from their international duties. The two Kiwis had a sharp turnaround this week, qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics with the U-23 New Zealand national team on Friday before flying back to Santa Barbara on Saturday to play in the Blue-Green rivalry game. Ashworth in particular made his presence known early on, making defensive stops and putting a couple of quick shots up in the opening minutes. The Gauchos continued to press the Mustang defense as the half wore on.† In the 31st minute, junior transfer Ameyawu Muntari shot a rocket toward the Cal Poly goal that ricocheted out to junior Rodney Michael on the right wing. Michael gathered the ball on his right foot and sent a perfect cross into the box towards an unmarked Carter Clemmensen who took the ball home to give UCSB a 1-0 lead. After a slow start to the season, Michael is hitting his stride at just the right time.† The star forward knocked in a goal in the Gauchos' last two matches, but he has also transformed into more of a playmaker as well. He opened up the second half with a shot on goal and in the 52nd minute, he took the ball down the right wing yet again and drove a low cross into the box towards Clemmensen. Clemmensen put a foot on the ball and it ricocheted off Mustang defender Josh Graham for an own goal, doubling the Gaucho lead to 2-0. Cal Poly wasn't ready to give up yet however, and the Mustangs revved up the physicality of the match in the second half. There were five yellow cards given out for both teams combined in the last 40 minutes of the game, including a second yellow and red card for Mustang midfielder Colin Hyatt. This increase in fouls shook the Gauchos off their game a little bit, and that small lapse was all that Cal Poly needed. With just about ten minutes to go, redshirt freshman Zack DiDonato was on the receiving end of a Mustang corner kick which he passed to forward Angel De Leon, who poked the ball into the back of the net. Just like that, the lead was down to one. Any dream of a Cal Poly comeback was dashed just a few minutes later however, when freshman phenom Finn Ballard McBride dribbled the ball out to around 23 yards and sent in a strike past the Mustang goalkeeper, putting UCSB up 3-1 and effectively ending the game. This was a much needed win for the Gauchos if they hope to work their way up the rankings and earn an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament. They will have to keep winning at home, especially as conference season kicks off this week when they take on Sacramento State on Wednesday. For now though, UCSB can celebrate knowing that we have the upper hand (and bragging rights) over our biggest rival.

The standing-room-only crowd had an electric atmosphere throughout, as these top-five water polo juggernauts faced off.† Kicking things off in the first, USC jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead after Trojan's Matt Maier and Hannes Daube found the back of the net. The Gauchos would not take long to respond as seniors Jacob Halle and Ivan Gvozdanovic evened things up after ripping off a goal a piece in merely 30 seconds of play.† Once things were tied up, USC's Jacob Mercep rallied off two goals by himself to regain the lead for the Trojans, now up 4-2. Just before the end of the first, a missed outside shot bounced off the post and landed right into USC's Matt Maier's lap, where he would draw an easy penalty. With three seconds left in the first, UCSB's goalie, Danny Roland, would come up huge to stuff the Trojan penalty. After the first quarter, USC had the 4-2 advantage over the Gauchos.† The second quarter saw a complete shift in momentum, as UCSB began to lock up the Trojan's offense. After several saves by Danny Roland and numerous Gaucho field blocks, the UCSB attack began to flourish. The Gaucho's would go on to score three unanswered goals, claiming a 5-4 lead late in the second. USC would eventually respond with their only goal of the quarter, making this one knotted up at five each going into the half. The second half was tight throughout, as goals went back and forth. In the third, we saw two huge goals by Ivan Gvozdanovic, who had a really efficient game. Gvozdanovic lead the Gaucho's in scoring with four goals in the contest. The offense was clicking for UCSB, but each time Santa Barbara saw a slight lead, it was erased by Trojan goals. After three, the game was tied at eight.† The final period began with a bang, as several really quick goals were scored. USC's Jacob Mercep scored on the first possession of the quarter and UCSB's Leo Yuno would come back with a beautiful strike of his own on a powerplay. After Yuno's goal, Jake Ehrhardt of USC would score with six minutes and 48 seconds left to recapture the lead. After those initial goals, the offense for both teams would stall dramatically. The fourth period turned out to be very physical as both teams ramped up their defenses and held each other scoreless. This one finished with No. 5 USC upsetting No. 4 UCSB, 10-9. UCSB's next game will be against UCLA this Friday, Oct. 11 at Spieker Aquatic Center. The game will kick off at 7 p.m. If you can't travel to support your Gauchos, tune into TheFosh.net for live stats.†

sports,UCSB Women's Soccer Team Blanks Long Beach State,8-Oct-19,9:40 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-08/ucsb-womens-soccer-team-blanks-long-beach-state/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team began conference play with a hard fought 1-0 win at home against defending Big West Champion Long Beach State on Sunday. This was their second win in a row and their fourth in their last five games. Dylan Lewis' goal in the 13th minute propelled the Gauchos to the win and improved their record to 5-3-3 overall and 1-0 in the Big West.† Long Beach State won the Big West regular season and tournament championship last year and they were picked to do it again in 2019, according to the Big West Preseason Coaches Poll. They came into Sunday's match with a 3-7 overall record and some momentum following a 2-1 win at Cal Poly on Thursday. Sunday's game was a chance for them to make a statement early on in Big West play. However, it was UCSB that attacked early, as the team put up four shots in the first 13 minutes, with the final attempt finding the net via the left leg of Dylan Lewis and assisted by Shaelan Murison. The goal was Lewis' second of the season and second in the last two games as she has been putting herself in good positions to score of late. Murison's four assists of the season lead the team and pair with her team-leading eight goals in their first eleven games.† That was the story of the first half, even though no one else found the net, because the Gauchos managed eight shots which dwarfed the two that Long Beach attempted.† The 49ers did have a great opportunity to even the score early in the second half, when junior Kaylee Ramirez attempted a penalty kick from inside the goal box in the 53rd minute, only for Gaucho keeper Hanna DeWeese to deflect the shot and send it wide right to protect the Gaucho lead. That shot was one of only two shots on goal that Long Beach managed during the match, and both attempts resulted in saves by DeWeese. Her two saves contributed to the second straight complete game shutout for DeWeese and her fifth in total on the year. DeWeese is currently all over the Big West leaderboard in goalkeeping stats; she is fourth in saves with 35, third in save percentage at .778 and first overall in goals-against average at 0.86 goals allowed per game. If her non-conference play can translate to the Big West portion of the schedule, the team will benefit and DeWeese will surely be an All-Conference player. UCSB won in part due to their offense's continued attack of the goal, and their 12 shots and six shots on goal tell the story when compared to LBSU's six shots and two shots on goal. This is the usual formula that Gaucho wins follow, where they are able to wear down the opposing defenders and goalkeeper until someone can slip a ball or two past the goalie. When UCSB is playing well like this, their offensive attack allows their defense to rest while the ball is on the other end, and they then have more energy to defend their own goal. Another big storyline for this game is that UCSB was without their usual starters Christine Maurer, Emma Vanderhyden and Lynsee Voss. This forced in a lot of new players into roles they are not entirely familiar with, and the reserves clearly stepped up, especially on the defensive end where the goalie never had to do too much work. Next, the Gauchos will travel up to UC Davis where they will face the Aggies, a team desperate for their first conference win. The game will take place on Thursday Oct. 10 at 4 p.m. in Davis.

sports,"UCSB Hosts Sac State, Visits No. 24 Fullerton as Big West Conference Play Begins",9-Oct-19,6:11 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-09/ucsb-hosts-sac-state-visits-no-24-fullerton-as-big-west-conference-play-begins/,"Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus The Gauchos are in top form as they take their undefeated streak of eight games in a row into the start of conference play for the men's soccer regular season. With the team's last and only pair of losses on the season occurring back in the first week of September, UC Santa Barbara holds all the momentum as they prepare to face Sacramento State and No. 24 Cal State Fullerton.† Currently at a 7-2-2 overall record on the year with a win percentage of .727, the Gauchos will want to keep their winning streak alive and start off conference play on the right foot. UCSB's first task in the Big West is a challenging one, as the team will first host a Sac State side that has won more games on the road than at home, and then travel south this weekend to Fullerton, where they have yet to lose a game at home throughout the entire season.† Although this will be only the second time UCSB has played a nationally ranked team, the first being the 3-3 tie to former No. 1 Stanford in double overtime, the Gauchos themselves are currently flirting with a spot in the nation's top 25. As of Oct. 7's update to the United Soccer Coaches' poll for NCAA Division 1 Men's Soccer, UCSB leads all teams in the ""òreceiving-votes' spot with 43. Another good set of performances, including potentially upsetting Fullerton in their own backyard, and the Gauchos will surely break into the top 25 by the end of the week.† As for Sac State, the Hornets have broke even at .500 with an overall record of 5-5-1 on the season. Statistically, the visitors have fared better when playing away from home; however, they find themselves in the midst of a three-game losing streak as they get set to face the on-fire Gauchos.† The record books also don't favor the Hornets in this one, as UCSB leads the all-time series by a record of 14-5-4. Nevertheless, this matchup is still a tricky one when considering Sac State took the W last time after beating UCSB the only time the two played last season by a score of 1-0.† Prior to their last home game, which resulted in a 1-1 double overtime tie to Loyola Marymount, Cal State Fullerton was perfect on the regular season with eight consecutive victories. Since then, the Titans have lost back-to-back games and are at risk of losing their No. 24 spot. They'll take on CSUN away from home on Wednesday before hosting UCSB this Saturday.† Historically, UCSB also retains the advantage in this one as they lead the all-time series by 33-26-4. A revenge game might be on the cards as UCSB took a 1-0 win last year during the regular season, but went on to lose against Fullerton in the postseason via penalty shootout.† Ones to watch for the Gauchos this week includes senior forward Will Baynham and freshman midfielder Finn Ballard McBride. At 6 feet and 3 inches, Baynham has excelled in a traditional striker role and has been productive on both ends of the scoresheet with at least a goal or assist in the past five games; he is currently tied for first in scoring with four goals to his name, and has a team-leading five assists. With two assists so far, Ballard McBride also joins Baynham as tied for top scorer on the Gauchos; Ballard McBride was also just awarded his third Big West Freshman of the Week accolade after being named the Big West Athlete of the Week the week prior.† For the Hornets, sophomore midfielder Oscar Govea leads Sac State in both scoring with three goals and three assists. Meanwhile, freshman forward Arath Chavez has scored twice this season and also is tied with Govea for team-leading in assists. The Titans will also see plenty of production out of their two stars, as junior forward Christian Pinzon and senior midfielder Oscar Flores lead the way for Cal State Fullerton. Pinzon has a team-leading five goals and three additional assists on the season. Whereas Flores matches him at the top of his team's scoring charts while earning the most assists for his team† by far at seven ""î enough to place him at second overall, behind CSUN's Julio Rubio, for playmaking in the Big West.† UCSB hosts Sac State this Wednesday, Oct. 9 and then visits No. 24 Fullerton on Saturday, Oct. 12; both matchups are scheduled for a 7 p.m. kickoff time.

sports,Gauchos Take 13-Game Win Streak Into Conf. Matchup With No. 19 Hawai'i,10-Oct-19,5:30 AM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/gauchos-take-13-game-win-streak-into-conf-matchup-with-no-19-hawaii/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara women's volleyball team will host No. 19 Hawai'i this Saturday after having swept both UC Davis and UC Riverside this past weekend. UCSB currently leads the Big West with a 15-1 overall record and will be hoping to continue their form against their toughest opponent yet. Hawai'i meanwhile is 13-2 and sits in third place.† After starting the season at 2-1, the Gauchos have been on an absolute tear winning 13 straight games including sweeps in each of their past four. Hawai'i has had similar success, though has lost two of their last five games including a meltdown at home against UC Irvine, a bottomfeeder team that was swept by UCSB just over a week ago.† Hawai'i had dominated early, winning the first two sets (25-11, 25-21) before the Anteaters were able to take three straight for the road win.† The win was a first for UCI, who had previously lost 40 straight matches to Hawai'i, and despite going down 0-2 early on, they were able to rally on the back of their offensive depth. Abby Marjama (14), Loryn Carter (13), and Onye Ofoegbu (13) all posted double-digit kills while Kelly Negron led both teams with 30 helpers.† I will, however, take a step back and say that those statistics may paint a different picture than what the fans saw on Friday. Hawai'i led both teams in every category save for blocks, while digs were even. Unfortunately for Hawai'i, they also committed seven more errors than the Anteaters and will surely be hurting after they let the game slip away with a 23-25 third set loss. They never recovered and posted a measly 29 points over last two sets. Hawai'i then hosted Cal State Fullerton, yet another team recently swept by the Gauchos, where they scraped by with a 3-2 win that saw them post more errors than their opponents for the third straight game.† In fact, Hawai'i had not committed more errors than any of their opponents during their 10-0 start to the season but have since committed more errors than their opponents in four of their last five matches. This stretch has seen Hawai'i's Rainbow Wahine volleyball squad go just 11-10 in sets.† While Hawai'i's surprise loss against UCI can be chalked up to be a small blemish, it is important to note that teams in pursuit of the title must win the must-wins. UCSB has done just that, dominating every opponent aside from University of Colorado who managed a 3-1 victory a mere three games into the season. The difference here is that CU is a solid but average 8-6 team while Hawai'i seemingly assumed they'd continue their winning streak over the 4-12 Anteaters.† UCSB and Hawai'i split the series last year with the road team coming out on top in both matches. Hawai'i pulled off a 3-2 win at the Thunderdome while the Gauchos vacationed to a 3-0 sweep in Honolulu.† UCSB's Lindsey Ruddins tied Hawai'i's McKenna Ross with 16 kills in the first match but led both teams with 11 at Hawai'i. Despite only posting 19 kills over last weekend's two games, Ruddins has been in phenomenal form this season and will be anticipating arguably the brightest spotlight yet as the Gauchos look to carry their momentum through a long stretch of conference play.† The games against against UCR and Davis proved that the Gauchos don't need insane firepower every game, but that their depth is composed of players young and old that are more than capable of competing at the highest level.† There was not a single double-double by a Gaucho last weekend and yet they still walked away with two sweeps. This team is legitimate and they're ready to compete.† Two of our nation's most ferocious programs will battle it out this Saturday at the Stan Sheriff Center in Manoa, Hawaii. The game starts at 7 p.m.

sports,Leading the Charge: Women of the UCSB Surf Team Turn the Tides Against Sexism,10-Oct-19,5:00 AM,['Hannah Jackson'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/leading-the-charge-women-of-the-ucsb-surf-team-turn-the-tides-against-sexism/,"Hannah Jackson / The Daily Nexus UC Santa Barbara is undoubtedly a surfer's paradise. Nestled in the Central Coast, Isla Vista is only a short drive from iconic surf locales like Rincon, Emma Wood, C Street and Jalama, while also boasting its own local gems like Sands and Devereux. The easy access of some of the best surf spots on the West Coast is one of the primary reasons fourth-year Surf Team members DaniRose Hill and Jessica Bixby chose UCSB over schools like UC Berkeley, where they were both accepted.† ""úI think just coming to Santa Barbara, and feeling how welcoming this community was, has to do with how close we are to the water,""ù Bixby explained. ""úI knew that my soccer career was coming to an end, so when I was visiting schools I was like, ""òI could start surfing all the time if I went here.' So I think that a huge factor for me was like I can be in the ocean all the time in Santa Barbara.""ù ""úThe water is what keeps me mentally balanced and happy, and I knew that I wanted to be around it,""ù Hill added. Even though I.V. may seem to be a haven to those who share a love of the ocean, struggles for female surfers lurk just below the surface. Kaira Wallace, co-captain of the UCSB Surf Team, noted that sexism runs rampant ""î even in a tight-knit community so focused on positivity.† ""ú[Sexism] comes in different forms. Men will paddle by you and be like, ""òOh, getting any waves?' and you're like, ""òYes, I'm getting waves. Did you ask this man over here if he was getting any waves?'""ù Wallace said.† ""úI feel like you definitely have to prove yourself a little bit more. Every time I go out I like thinking in my head like, ""òDon't fuck up.' Cause if someone's easy to fuck up then they're not going to take you seriously,""ù she added. Lily Day, a fourth-year Surf Team member agrees. ""úI feel like you really have to earn your place. You're marked from when you first paddle out. The first wave is so important, because if I fall or eat shit, then all the guys know they can drop in on my waves, or won't respect me,""ù Day said. The gender barrier didn't completely dissipate within the confines of the team. Even outside the water, gender roles in years past caused tension amongst team members.† ""úThere was a tendency for some older guys on the team to have the position and kind of play the mascot in this role, of getting to do the fun things and shout into a megaphone and kind of get all of the credit,""ù Hill noted.† ""úBut behind the scenes they weren't running any of the logistics and a lot of the girls for a lot of years had the job of being the bitch. We were the ones that were pestering people and getting things done and kind of doing all the grunt work that isn't fun and doesn't make you likable,""ù she said frankly. The gendered aspect of the sport is nothing new to the women. Growing up, all of them faced similar experiences of discrimination on the basis of sex. It certainly didn't help that by the time they reached high school, the number of female surfers dwindled to a number you could count on one hand.† ""úAs soon as you got into the high school surf team there was like maybe one or two other girls on the team tops,""ù Hill said.† Even though they constantly found themselves outnumbered during their formative years, the women all held out hope for a more female future in the sport.† ""úIn some ways it was a lot harder to build confidence because I wasn't doing it alongside other girls. I always knew that I was like standing alone and navigating it alone, despite guy friends that I had,""ù Hill said.† ""úI didn't feel like I had that pack to lean on. I didn't have other girls to look up to to go, ""òOh, I can surf like that one day.' I could only find that really through the media. But in another way, at times, I derive confidence from it just because I knew that one day there would be more girls, you know, if those few people that are on the team don't keep surfing, then there will be no foundation for more girls.""ù In spite of the negativity, both Bixby and Hill recall their late mentors ""î Bixby's father Mark and Hill's coach Stan Searfus ""î both of whom helped normalize women in the water. ""úThe first time I really felt my gender in the water, my mentor Stan saw how excited I was to surf. He invited me on a six-mile paddle and I was the only girl there. And some of the guys were kind of surprised that I showed up. There was classic boy banter. I wasn't supposed to hear it but one of them said, ""òWhat is she doing here?' Stan went up to them and said, ""òWell she's out here, she's doing this paddle and she's going to be surfing with us, so get used to it,' and that was so foundational to me.""ù For the women, the UCSB Surf Team proved a massive improvement, boasting a whopping five women their freshman year. It has since grown to more than 20.† ""úI think each year it's just more exciting. Getting to college, I remember even being so stoked to be on a team with like five girls ""î that was mind blowing. And then the next year it was 12 girls at a competition all surfing together, like in the water dominating the lineup. Each year it's increasing and it's just makes you feel so much more comfortable in the water. People are more accepting and it's more fun environment. Whereas I think when there's too many men present, it just feels so competitive and like quiet. But I think women really liven up that environment,""ù Bixby concluded.† Even though the surf team has increased four-fold since Hill, Bixby and Wallace first joined the team in 2016, the fight for equality isn't over yet. When asked to give advice to future generations of female surfers, Wallace doesn't mince words.† ""úDon't take shit from any fucking guy out there. Do not take shit from him because you just like being in the water, you've overcome so much more than he ever will.""ù
Print love this so much!  props to all the female surfers out there not taking shit from anyone! It's been awesome surfing with you girls all these years! I love the energy you all bring! What an amazing article highlighting amazing women. It's incredible to see UCSB's female surfers pioneering the way forward for other women in the sport. Challenging the status quo is never comfortable, but the benefit to future generations is invaluable. The Isla Vista community owes them a great deal.

sports,UCSB Women's Soccer Heads North to Face UC Davis,10-Oct-19,5:10 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-10/ucsb-womens-soccer-heads-north-to-face-uc-davis/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara women's soccer team will head to UC Davis this Thursday where the Gauchos will look to take on their second conference win of the season and add another win to their overall record of 5-3-3.† After an impressive win against Long Beach State, Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm as of late, which is an encouraging sight heading into the heart of conference play.

In their most recent matchup against Long Beach State, freshman midfielder Dylan Lewis netted the only goal in the thirteenth minute of the game. Lewis played an integral part throughout the game as she had a total of three shots on goal, putting constant pressure on the 49er goalkeeper. Multiple players had shot attempts in this matchup with Shaelan Murision leading the way with four.† Senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese continued her stellar play as she had two saves, which included a crucial save on a penalty in the second half. DeWeese has proven to be the anchor of the ""òChos defense as she now has a total of six clean sheets thus far. With the Gauchos' defenders constantly pressuring the opponent's teams forwards, there have been few shots on goal which has led to DeWeese finding her comfort zone in front of the net. 

UC Davis heads into this game on a four-game losing streak and an overall record of 5-7 including an 0-2 conference record. In their most recent matchup against UC Irvine, the Aggies took the lead in the fourth minute of the game but gave up two goals in the 10th and 34th minute. A common theme for UC Davis has been their inability to find ways to win close games as three of their last four losses have been by just a goal. 

That being said, the Aggies are extremely talented with sophomore Casey Palmer and redshirt freshman midfielder Leslie Fregoso leading the way offensively with three goals each. Defensively the squad is led by junior goalkeeper Nicki Rucki who has a total of 27 saves on the year with a save percentage of 73%. 

In order for UCSB to have success in this matchup, it will be crucial for players to continue to emerge offensively. Lewis was a key contributor last week and will look to continue playing at a high level this upcoming Thursday. This will take pressure off of senior forward Murison and allow her to operate in the penalty box without a double team coming. 

Moreover, the team will need to continue to keep up their pressure on the defensive end. With consistent pressure in the middle half of the field, Santa Barbara has limited the amount of opportunities that opponents have had on goal. By remaining disciplined, this will ensure that opponents do not become comfortable or create chances on a transition attack. 

As the season has gone on, the ""òChos have started to close out games rather than ending up with a tie. Much of this can be attributed to the team building their chemistry throughout the season, especially with this young of a group. It could not have come at a better time as well with conference play starting up as Santa Barbara will look to make a push for the Big West championship. With a team playing as hard as they are, surely good things will continue to happen for the talented squad.† UCSB is back in action this Thursday against UC Davis at 4 p.m. where the Gauchos will look to pick up their second win in conference play as well as their fourth win away from home.†

sports,UCSB Women's Soccer Beats UC Davis 2-1 For Third Consecutive Win,13-Oct-19,2:45 PM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-13/ucsb-womens-soccer-defeats-uc-davis-2-1-for-third-consecutive-win/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team prevailed on the road over UC Davis on Thursday thanks to a timely 85th minute goal by senior Shaelan Murison to break the tie and give the Gauchos their third straight win.† The ""òChos are now 6-3-3 overall and 2-0 in the Big West. This win adds to UCSB's recent stretch of great play, as they have now won five of their last six contests after a somewhat slow start to the season.† UC Davis came into this game with something to prove having lost four straight games, including two conference games, dropping their record to 5-7.† But even with the added motivation, it was Santa Barbara that struck first, as Murison punched in a free kick for her ninth goal of the season at the 13:55 mark in the first half. The score held up for a decent stretch until Aggie Junior Ana Williams knocked in the game-tying score in the 36th minute, her second goal of the season.† The first half ended with the score tied and the second half continued with much of the same, as both teams got some decent looks at the goal but could not convert. But even as both teams got opportunities on offense, the Gauchos were the ones who had the edge as their 19 shot attempts nearly doubled the Aggies' 10 attempts. This disparity in shot opportunities is what ended up giving the Gauchos the edge by the end, as Murison knocked down her second goal of the afternoon in the 85th minute and clinched the win for Santa Barbara.† Murison continues to make her case for Big West Player of the Year by scoring her ninth and tenth goals of the season on a day when she attempted a game-high nine shots and put six of them on frame. Her 10 goals place her first in the Big West in that category, and she also leads the conference in shots attempted, with 62.† Besides Murison, two other Gauchos attempted multiple shots, as junior Isabella Viana got four shots off, and senior Katherine Sheehy attempted three shots, two of them being on goal. Senior Hanna DeWeese held down the goal for another stellar performance, only allowing one goal in a game where she was under attack a fair amount. DeWeese had four saves on five shots on goal, and she continues to lead the Big West in goals allowed per game, with a .87 average.† For the Aggies, this loss proved to be another heartbreaker in a string of five straight difficult losses for their squad. Of their last five defeats, four of them have been lost by a margin of just one goal, and they are struggling to get over that hump. They have proved to be a capable team in the past when they won five of their first eight matchups, but since then bad luck and some costly mistakes have sent them into a downward spiral. UC Davis has many capable weapons on offense as six Aggies have scored multiple goals on the season, but none of them have recorded more than three goals. The emergence of a go-to player on offense might be what gets Davis back on track as we move further into conference play. With Thursday's win, the UCSB joins Hawai'i and Cal State Fullerton as the only remaining unbeaten teams in the Big West. The Gauchos will now get a week off before they hit the road again this Thursday, Oct. 17, to take on the 8-4-3 (2-1) Cal State Northridge Matadors, who have built some momentum of their own by winning their last two games. Next Thursday's game will kick off in Northridge at 7:00 p.m.

sports,"No. 12 UCSB Men's Soccer Dominates CSUF, Extends Unbeaten Streak to 10",14-Oct-19,2:36 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-14/no-12-ucsb-mens-soccer-dominates-csuf-extends-unbeaten-streak-to-10/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The No. 12 UCSB men's soccer team steamrolled over Cal State Fullerton on Saturday night, handing the Titans their first home loss of the season with a 5-0 blowout.† The Gauchos extended their streak of games without a loss to 10 and now sit at a 2-0 conference, 9-2-2 overall record on the season. CSUF dropped to an 0-2 conference, 8-4-1 overall record with the loss. Although UCSB has beaten squads like Seattle U and tied teams like No. 7 Stanford, this win might be the most impressive result so far. Both the Gauchos and the Titans were vying for a place in the national rankings coming into this matchup, with UCSB debuting on the Top Drawer Soccer rankings at No. 19 while Fullerton clinged to a No. 22 spot on that list and a No. 24 spot in the United Soccer Coaches poll. What looked to be a colossal matchup between two of the top teams in the conference turned into a bloodbath pretty quickly. The Gauchos dominated from the opening kick, passing circles around the Titan defense. They strung together a quick combination in the midfield just eight minutes in that culminated with a Noah Billingsley cross to forward Rodney Michael on the right side of the box. Michael sent in a low driven pass to Will Baynham who used his 6'3""ù frame to hold off a defender and place the ball in the lower left corner for a goal. Just four minutes later, Billingsley stole the ball deep in Titan territory and set a streaking Thibault Candia up with a through ball in the box. Candia stepped up and rocketed the ball past the CSUF goalkeeper to double the Gaucho lead at the 12 minute mark. This was one of the most complete halves that UCSB has put together this season, and a large part of the team's heightened level of play can be attributed to the return of senior defender Billingsley. In the first 30 minutes of the match he had multiple key stops on the defensive end, and he got his second assist of the game in the 28th minute when Michael corralled his pass in the box and ricocheted a shot into the back of the net. Both Billingsley and junior defender Hunter Ashworth are now back after qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics with the New Zealand U-23 team, and have filled the extremely important gap in the defense left by Faouzi Taieb's devastating knee injury in the game against Stanford. They've been at the helm of this Gaucho defense that now has a Big West leading six shutouts under its belt, and only gave up two shots on goal in the first half. The halftime break cooled UCSB off, and the Titans came out looking to gain some momentum and cut into the 3-0 deficit. Junior defender Clayton Torr put an early shot on goal that was saved by UCSB goalie Ben Roach in the 46th minute, but that ended up being the first of only two shots on goal for the rest of the period for CSUF. UCSB started to gain momentum as the half wore on, and in the 59th minute Baynham stole an attempted clearance in the Fullerton third of the field and sent in a pass to the box that took a slight touch from Billingsley before falling at the feet of forward Finn Ballard McBride.† Ballard McBride took a touch and calmly curled the ball around the goalkeeper for his sixth goal in what has been an incredible freshman campaign. The Australian already has two Big West Freshman of the Week awards to go along with one Big West Offensive Player of the Week award, and is fourth in the conference in goals scored. He's a leading candidate for Freshman of the Year so far and he put the Gauchos up 4-0 around 15 minutes into the second half. The Gauchos notched their fifth and final goal in the 66th minute when Ashworth headed home a Candia corner kick, putting an end to an incredible scoring onslaught. Looking ahead, UCSB should be moving into the official NCAA Top 25, which is based off of the United Soccer Coaches Poll. If the Gauchos continue to mow through the conference with only one or two more losses they are in prime position to qualify for the NCAA Tournament outright, a feat the team hasn't achieved since 2015.† This squad has hit its stride at the perfect time. If they can stay perfect in this extremely talented Big West Conference there's no telling what the ceiling is for the Gauchos.

sports,"No. 12 UCSB Undefeated in Ten Straight, Set to Host UCR and UCI",16-Oct-19,4:49 PM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-16/no-12-ucsb-undefeated-in-ten-straight-set-to-host-ucr-and-uci/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus After last week's pair of dominant Big West performances, which both resulted in clean sheets for the Gauchos, No. 12 UCSB now looks toward this week's home slate of games as the team will want to defend its current streak of ten wins. Now boasting an overall record of 9-2-2 on the season, the Gauchos enter this week with a renewed inspiration to further climb the nation's power rankings. Prior to last week's 2-0 victory over Sac State and the surprise 5-0 shutout over former No. 24 Fullerton, UCSB was the highest-receiving votes team and had yet to break into the top 25. Now, in the midst of this near historic winning streak, the Gauchos have been recognized in the No. 12 spot in the Top Drawer Soccer National Rankings. Although the record books say UCSB's greatest unbeaten streak of 17 wins occurred back in 1982, the Gauchos are staring at potentially tying for second all-time in the program's history if they come out of this week with twelve straight. Still, even with the team finding themselves atop the Big West standings, conference matches always prove to be a formidable test. UC Riverside's schedule hasn't gone quite as smooth however, as the Highlanders are coming off of a 1-0 win over Cal Poly but only after six consecutive losses.. On the season, UCR stands at a 6-5-2 overall record and will start a new week of conference play first away at Santa Barbara before weekend travel to UC Davis ""î the Big West's second-place team. UCSB has the historical advantage in this matchup, as the Gauchos lead in the all-time series over the Highlanders by a record of 26-6-2. This will also prove to be a bit of a revenge game for the home side as UCSB lost 1-0 to UCR in their previous matchup during last season's conference campaign. After outscoring last week's opponents by a tally of 7-0, there are several ones to watch for the Gauchos this week; two worth highlighting are sophomore keeper Ben Roach and senior defender Noah Billingsley. Through the unbeaten streak, Roach has amassed more clean sheets than not with six total shutouts ""î a wall in between the posts. Meanwhile, Billingsley was the orchestrator in the 5-0 win over Fullerton which had five different Gauchos score on the night. Although he wasn't one of the scorers, Billingsley earned a hat trick in assists with three for his team. For the Highlanders, junior forwards Roberto Garcia-Vargas and Hugo Magana Jr. have been the key attackers as the pair leads UCR in scoring with three goals scored each. All of the Big West action starts this Wednesday at Harder Stadium, when UCSB hosts UC Riverside on Oct. 16 at 7 p.m. Comments are closed.

sports,No. 12 UCSB Men's Soccer Wins First Leg of Two-Game Homestand,17-Oct-19,12:27 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/no-12-ucsb-mens-soccer-wins-first-leg-of-two-game-homestand/,"† Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Two second-half goals by freshman phenom Finn Ballard McBride gave the No. 12 UCSB men's soccer team its fourth win in a row on Wednesday night. The Gauchos took down the UC Riverside Highlanders 2-0 and extended their non-losing streak to 11 games. UCR fell to a 1-2 conference, 6-6-2 overall record with the loss and now stands at sixth place in the Big West. UCSB claimed sole possession of first place with the victory and has a 10-2-2 overall, 3-0 conference record. The game started out very evenly matched. Although the Gauchos maintained possession for most of the first half, the Highlanders did a great job of staying back and breaking up any attacks in the final third. UCSB was able to continue to string together passes as the half wore on, yet the team actually put up less shots than UCR and no shots on goal in the first period. ""úWe weren't really sharp enough, I thought, in the first thirty minutes,""ù Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg pointed out postgame. ""úWe didn't do enough to get a goal and that pushed us in the second half.""ù A key move that helped bring some life to the UCSB offense was the insertion of junior transfer and forward Ameyawu Muntari in the 31st minute. Muntari has been a spark plug for the Gauchos all year long in his first season with the team, using his agility and touch to get around defenders and produce offense out of nothing. In the 39th minute, the Ghanaian forward sent in a high-arching cross to a wide-open Rodney Michael in the box who headed it just wide of the goal, marking one of UCSB's best chances in the half. The Highlanders were not intimidated by the Gauchos at all, however, and in the 41st minute, a quick miscommunication between centerbacks William Gillingham and Hunter Ashworth led to UCR defender Jose Ponce receiving the ball in the box in prime position to score. His touch went just wide, however, and the Gauchos narrowly avoided giving up their first goal of conference play.† UCSB came into the second half looking like an entirely different team. ""úAll we really did at halftime was reorganize and collect our breath,""ù Coach Vom Steeg said. ""úWe basically discussed what we were doing in the first half and going out there and doing it better.""ù It only took seven minutes for the Gauchos to get on the scoreboard, and it just had to be attacking midfielder Finn Ballard McBride who knocked it home. The Australian freshman placed a Rodney Michael-cross into the bottom-right corner of the goal, just past the Highlander keeper's gloves to break the tie. ""úTim [Vom Steeg] told us before the game that you gotta get numbers in the box,""ù Ballard McBride said after the game. ""úAnd once you get it wide and cross it enough times, there's bound to be a mistake or someone open and you just gotta be at the right place to finish it off, and I was there.""ù Rather than inspiring the Gauchos, the goal seemed to have an unintended effect, spurning the UCR attack. The Highlanders began to press and possess the ball as they reached the midway point of the half. Their attack culminated in a free kick in the 58th minute by Daniel Aguirre that took an outstanding effort from Gaucho goalkeeper Ben Roach to not see the back of the net. Just as it seemed that the Highlanders were going to take control of the match, Ballard McBride struck again. In the 67th minute, senior defender Noah Billingsley sent in a cross from the right side of the field that floated seemingly out of reach of the freshman. Ballard McBride turned his body as he was falling away and blasted the ball into the upper left corner with his head, doubling the lead and essentially putting the game out of reach. ""úI was coming in from the back post and saw the ball coming in the whole way through,""ù the midfielder explained. ""úThen I just got a clean connection with it, squared up my shoulders, put my head through it and it just flew in.""ù Ballard McBride has scored in each of the Gauchos' last four victories and has put in eight goals in total on the season, numbers that would be incredible for any player but are almost unbelievable for a first year. He is certainly a lock for the Big West Freshman of the Year Award and could possibly receive national recognition before the season is done. The Gauchos will now look to keep the streak alive on Saturday night when they host the UC Irvine Anteaters at 7 p.m. at Harder Stadium.

sports,No. 5 UCSB Men's Water Polo Looks for Revenge Against No. 3 Pacific,17-Oct-19,5:15 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-17/no-5-ucsb-mens-water-polo-looks-for-revenge-against-no-3-pacific/,"Nexus File Photo Two weeks ago, the UCSB men's water polo team was on top of the world with a 15-0 record and the No. 1 position in the polls. Four games later, they're 15-4, No. 5 in the nation and in need of a win. The Gauchos will get the chance to go for that win on Sunday when they host No. 3 Pacific in their first regular season Golden Coast Conference matchup of the year. The Tigers contributed to UCSB's recent swoon with an 11-10 victory in the third-place game at the SoCal Invitational on Sept. 29. The Gauchos went down early in that game but managed to mount a comeback effort and tied things up at 10 apiece with just over a minute to go. A few short seconds later, however, Pacific found the back of the net one more time to turn the comeback aside and seal the victory. Sunday's game, then, is a chance for UCSB to not only stem their slide but to avenge what was then a crushing upset. Pacific, however, has had a much more successful go of it in the time since that first matchup. The Tigers are 2-1 with victories over then-No. 10 UC Davis and No. 4 USC. The one blemish was an 11-8 loss to No. 1 Stanford that could have gone either way. The Tiger attack has four main heads: redshirt senior utility Luke Pavillard, freshman utility Jeremie Cote, senior attacker Engin Ege Colak and freshman attacker Matthew Hosmer. Pavillard leads the team with 36 goals this season but any one of those four is a threat to the defense. Cote and Colak did most of the damage in UCSB's first clash with Pacific. Each player finished with four goals apiece, with Colak providing the final nail in the coffin in the fourth quarter. There's not much the Gauchos need to change from their game plan in that first matchup, however. If anything, the UCSB team will somewhat obviously try to avoid going down early this time around but even that is not as imperative as it might seem. This Pacific team has a slight habit of losing leads, something it did in both of its losses to Stanford and the game against the Gauchos. UCSB's chances of opening up conference play on the right foot will also depend in part on their ability to take advantage of offensive opportunities. The Gauchos shot just .313 in the Sept. 29 matchup and haven't improved much upon that mark since then. The Gauchos will also have to do a better job of turning defensive execution into offensive results. UCSB collected eight steals against Pacific but were unable to make the most of many of those opportunities. Pacific sophomore goalie Jon Barry posted 11 saves and one steal in the first matchup and in doing so played a major role in preventing the Gauchos from realizing those opportunities. Barry has been solid in goal all season but far from impenetrable, with 120 goals allowed compared to 111 total saves. In the first Pacific matchup, the UCSB game plan created plenty of chances against Barry for the team's attackers, particularly for juniors Cole Brosnan and Leo Yuno and sophomore Sam Nangle. On Sunday, those same attackers will try to turn that game plan and those opportunities into offensive fireworks. The Gauchos scored more than 11 goals in 12 of their first 15 games but have failed to crack that total during their four-game losing streak. If the UCSB attackers can create those fireworks and break that 11-goal plateau once more, they'll put themselves in a position to snap that streak and get their conference play off to the right start. UCSB hosts Pacific at Campus Pool on Sunday afternoon at 12 p.m.

Santa Barbara was last in action on Thursday when the squad was able to pick a 2-1 win over UC Davis. Senior forward Shaelan Murison recorded two goals, including the go-ahead winner in the 83rd minute. Murison now has double-digit goals on the season and has cemented herself as the ""òChos go-to goal scorer. Senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese had four saves in the matchup, as she was able to stop the Aggies from finding the back of the net multiple times. DeWeese continues to be one of the bright spots in the lineup, recording a total of six clean sheets on the season. Cal State Northridge will come into this matchup with an overall record of 8-4-3. The Matadors have been extremely impressive this year behind strong play from sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Delgado. Delgado has recorded 41 saves on the year with a save percentage of 78.8%. Offensively, CSUN is led by sophomore forward Alexis White who has scored five goals on the year along with an assist. Cal Poly, on the other hand, has struggled this season as the Mustangs are 4-9-1 this year and have lost three of their last six matchups. Freshman midfielder Camille Lafaix leads the team with four goals and two assists with freshman forward Nikki Trucco coming in right behind her with two goals. The Mustangs have not been able to put it together defensively in particular this year as the team tends to fall behind early, putting them in the difficult situation of constantly trying to come from behind. In order for Santa Barbara to have success in these matchups, the Gauchos must continue to play aggressively on the defensive side of the field while avoiding fouls. Over their past three games, UCSB has found a good balance between the two which has allowed them to control the time of possession. While the Gauchos have found success as of late, it will be crucial for the team to continue to rely on their fundamentals as that has helped put them over the top in their recent close games. That being said, the team must also continue to develop their offensive identity as the team has still not found their second scorer behind Murison. Even though UCSB has had success despite this fact, the team will surely need to find their second threat on the offensive side of the ball ""î especially with the team looking to compete for the Big West title. Although Murison has found ways to score despite double-teams and opponents keying in on her in the penalty box, a second scorer can help take some of the pressure off of her shoulders. Santa Barbara seems to have found their rhythm at the perfect time as UCSB remains undefeated in conference play. Their important test coming up against CSUN will be a good indicator of where the Gauchos are against a team that is playing extremely well. If UCSB is able to make the Matadors uncomfortable in their own half, the team will have opportunities to capitalize on mistakes that could potentially lead to a transition attack. The Gauchos are back in action twice this week with one game on Thursday against CSUN at 7 p.m. and the other back at home against rival Cal Poly at 1 p.m. on Sunday, where the ""òChos will look to secure their third and fourth win in conference play.

The Gauchos' 13-game win streak came to an end last Saturday at the hands of perennial powerhouse Hawai'i and they will be looking to get back on track against their fiercest rivals. The Mustangs dominated the rivalry last year, sweeping both matches. Despite two valiant efforts from the Gauchos, they simply lacked the composure and discipline needed for matches like this. UCSB committed 41 errors in those two games, over double that of Cal Poly's 17. The Gauchos were pretty inefficient as well, shooting .167 and .160 in each game respectively. Things have been different this season, though, and the Gauchos have proven to be clinical killers very much capable of beating anyone. Saturday's unexpected sweep by Hawai'i was just their second loss this season, giving UCSB a 15-2 record overall. While possessing the best overall record in the Big West, the loss to Hawai'i means UCSB now sits second in the conference with a 5-1 record, just shy of Cal Poly who sits atop unblemished at 6-0. Cal Poly is currently on an eight-game win streak and were winners in 13 of their last 15 matches. They also just happen to be coming off a 3-0 sweep against Hawai'i. So what now for the Gauchos? Really, the only answer is up. There are just three games separating the Gauchos from their next back-to-back matchups against Hawai'i and Cal Poly, and they will surely regret letting one tough loss get the best of them. If the Gauchos really want to win this thing, it starts with a statement on Saturday night. There really isn't a good sample size considering the Gauchos have lost just twice this season, but I will still note that UCSB's 13-game win streak started after their loss to the University of Colorado. That intensity and that pursuit of greatness needs to be felt the moment they step on the court this weekend. Taking a look at the statistics will tell you that the Gauchos have the upper hand in kills, kills/set, errors, hitting percentage, assists, digs, digs/set and blocks. However, Cal Poly will be rolling out more individual leaders in those categories, meaning that the Gauchos will once again be looking to win off their deep lineup. So then the question is, if the Gauchos are seemingly the most dominant team in the conference, what is there to worry about? The thing to worry about is that the Gauchos just got knocked off their 13-game run by the third-place team right before they're set to take on their biggest rivals ""î who just so happen to be pretty much just as good as the Gauchos while also possessing a perfect conference record. You must forgive me for having said this in the past, but the Gauchos will really show us who they are this weekend. Composure, discipline and confidence are not on paper and cannot be so easily measured. This game is a must-win for the Gauchos if they are to have any wiggle room in the coming weeks.

sports,No. 5 UCSB Men's Water Polo Falls to No. 3 Pacific For Fifth Straight Loss,22-Oct-19,9:53 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-22/no-5-ucsb-mens-water-polo-falls-to-no-3-pacific-for-fifth-straight-loss/,"Ivan Gvozdanovic aims for the goal. Nexus File Photo. UCSB men's water polo head coach Wolf Wigo wanted a defensive struggle in his team's game against Pacific on Sunday. He got an offensive shootout instead. Much to Wigo's chagrin, the Gauchos and the Tigers traded goals from start to finish, with Pacific coming out on top with a final-minute goal to take a 17-16 victory. The loss was UCSB's fifth in a row and dropped the Gauchos to 15-5 on the season and 0-1 in Golden Coast Conference play.† Sunday's game was the second matchup between UCSB and Pacific, who have both proven themselves to be dangerous attackers who thrive in shootouts. Wigo emphasized that danger to his team in the lead up to Sunday's game, but to no avail. ""úWe didn't want to be in a game like this,""ù Wigo said after the game. ""úThis is a game [Pacific] wants to have. That's how they play, it's a run-and-gun, high-scoring style""¶ we talked about how we wanted it to be an 8-7 or 7-6 game and that would be better for us.""ù It was clear from the outset that Sunday's score was going to be far higher than Wigo or the UCSB team desired. The Gauchos drew first blood with a first-minute goal by junior attacker Cole Brosnan assisted by senior attacker Jacob Halle, but the Tigers responded with three goals spread over the ensuing three minutes. Pacific scored a total of five goals in the first quarter, and depended heavily on exclusions to do so. Senior attacker Engin Ege Colak set up two of those early goals by drawing exclusions, and senior utility Andrea De Nardi did the same a few minutes later, creating a power play that led to the Tigers' fifth and final goal of the quarter. While Ege Colak and De Nardi helped set up some of the goals, the Tigers relied on redshirt senior utility Luke Pavillard, senior attacker Luis Araya and freshman utility Jeremie Cote to do the lion's share of the goal-scoring. Pavillard scored twice in the first quarter and led the team with six goals in the game, while Cote and Araya both scored once in the first and finished with four and three goals, respectively. The Tigers forced the Gauchos out of their desired game plan early, but UCSB adapted with aplomb. The hosts went on the attack in the second quarter and poured in six goals, tying the game up at nine going into halftime.† ""úThe offense was great,""ù Wigo said. ""úWe did so many good things on offense.""ù Sophomore attacker Sam Nangle led the charge with two goals in the second quarter, but he had plenty of help. Brosnan chipped in a goal of his own thanks in large part to some wizardry on the part of senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic, who forced his way inside with a strong drive and then flicked a pass behind his head to a cutting Brosnan for the score. Halle, junior defender Mason McQuet and sophomore attacker Tommy Hawkins all chipped in goals as well, making it hard for the Tiger defense to key in on any one area of the Gaucho attack.† Wigo switched goalkeepers for the second half, substituting sophomore Danny Roland for junior Tiago Bonchristiano, but the shootout continued largely unabated. Both teams posted five goals in the third quarter, although Pacific controlled much of the exchange and never trailed. Neither team was able to grab the lead for the first few minutes of the fourth quarter, instead trading fouls and turnovers. Nangle notched his team-leading fourth goal of the game with 5:42 to go for UCSB's first lead since the first quarter, but Araya tied it up again just over a minute later. Another minute after that, Nangle drew an exclusion, setting the Gauchos up for a go-ahead goal. The Tigers put two of their remaining defenders in front of the goal, alongside sophomore goalkeeper Jon Barry, but Halle still managed to slot the ball through the tangle of arms for a 16-15 UCSB lead. The Gauchos created another opportunity one minute later with a good drive down the middle on the attack, but an extra pass led to a turnover, which in turn led to a Cote goal with 1:40 left in the game.† ""úThat was really the theme of the whole game,""ù Wigo said. ""úWe had some amazing plays on offense and we just kept giving up goals every time we got back in the game or got the lead.""ù Suddenly deadlocked again, the Gauchos had two opportunities to grab one final lead. An aggressive play by Barry created a Pacific steal, stifling the first chance, and redshirt sophomore attacker Leo Yuno's attempt at a long-distance strike went wide with around 30 seconds to play. That was enough time for Pacific to come down on the next possession and work the ball around to Araya, who rose up and netted a distance strike with just 12 seconds left. A Brosnan heave ended up in the arms of Barry, sealing the Tigers' shootout win. Nine different Gauchos scored on Sunday. Nangle led the attacking effort, but Brosnan, his sophomore driver brother Ryan Brosnan, Halle and Gvozdanovic all tallied two goals of their own. Gvozdanovic added two steals and two assists as well, making for a well-rounded performance.†

Entering Saturday's contest, UCSB is coming off of a tough home loss at the hands of the University of the Pacific. The game was extremely tight, going back and forth throughout, but Pacific ultimately found the back of the net in the closing seconds to steal a victory. The Gauchos are now in fifth place in the Golden Coast Conference after dropping the season opener, and currently own a 0-1 conference, 15-5 overall record. Long Beach State is two spots above them in the standings and claims a 1-0 conference, 12-8 overall record. UCSB is looking to get back on track Saturday and steal a road win of their own in a hostile environment. Leo Yuno has been a strong bright spot this year for this very successful UCSB team. In his first year starting, Yuno has been performing at a very high level, scoring consistently and playing solid defense for the Gauchos. He even managed to secure a Gold Coast Conference Player of the Week award a few weeks back for his outstanding play. If UCSB wants to get back to their winning ways however, they will need Yuno and the entire Gaucho roster to step up. Head coach Wolf Wigo stressed after the last loss that the key for this team will be putting their mark on games early and not allowing themselves to get caught up in trying to play the other team's game. The core identity of this squad is defense and if the Gauchos continue to get into high-scoring shootouts with their opponents, they will have a hard time climbing up the conference rankings. To hopefully get some more insight on how this win was going to come to fruition, I sat down with junior attacker Leo Yuno to ask him a few questions: Jesse Morrison, Daily Nexus: How do you and the team plan to get back on track this weekend? Leo Yuno: We have to continue to work hard at practice every day. Got to continue to learn and improve as a team. And we have to man up and play good one-on-one defense. JM: Seems like you and the guys on the team really get along well with one another, what do you guys do together in your free time?""ù LY: Aside from class and practice, we eat together a lot in the dining commons and we try and get surf sessions in when we can. JM: So ultimately, where do you think this team ends up? LY: We want to go to NCAAs, make a serious run for it and hopefully win it. We want to bring that ring home. As always, if you can't travel this Saturday to support your Gauchos, tune in to theFosh.net for live updates and stats. Also, make sure to pack the pool this Sunday for the game versus Cal to give the team a much-needed boost.

sports,No. 17 UCSB Men's Soccer Ties UC Davis Aggies 1-1,24-Oct-19,5:30 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-24/no-17-ucsb-mens-soccer-ties-uc-davis-aggies-1-1/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus It has been tough sledding for the No. 17 UCSB men's soccer team since their loss last weekend to UC Irvine, which ultimately ended the Blue and Gold's unbeaten streak in 11 straight matches, but their most recent tie away at UC Davis was hard-fought and showed plenty of positives. Now at a 10-3-3 overall record on the season and 3-1-1 in the Big West, the Gauchos will look forward to closing out the regular season on a strong note as only two matches are left in conference play; away at CSUN this Saturday, then away again next Saturday for the second installment of the Blue-Green rivalry. As it stands, UCSB, UC Davis and UC Irvine all share the top spot in the Big West standings with 10 points apiece ""î with the latter team currently holding the tiebreaker in conference record.
Wednesday's proceedings began with UCSB visiting UC Davis for a rare day game at Aggie Soccer Field. Whether it was motivated by protecting their home field in order to earn the top spot in the Big West or determination to defeat a top-20 program in the nation in UCSB, the Aggies got off to a fiery start as they peppered the Gauchos' goal with plenty of shots early on in the match. So much so that junior defender Hunter Ashworth already saw yellow by the seventh minute of play and was the first of four Gauchos that would go on to be booked by the referee. It wasn't until minute 13 that the Gauchos found their first chance of the game off a corner kick by junior forward Ameyawu Muntari. Unfortunately, senior midfielder Thibault Candia, who has been brilliant for the Gauchos all season, picked up a knock and freshman midfielder Finn Ballard McBride came on for the injured Gaucho. Following this sequence, UCSB slowly began to find their rhythm, but UC Davis kept their shots flooding in as the first half went on. Then, by the 38th minute, a corner kick for the Aggies set up the match's first score as a crowded penalty area triggered a Gaucho own goal. Perhaps the Aggies' celebrations of going one up had gone to their heads, as it literally took a matter of seconds for UCSB to respond. And respond they did, as the Gauchos seemingly went straight for the host's goal from kickoff. The equalizing goal was set up off a shot from senior forward Will Baynham. Baynham's initial shot was saved by Aggie goalkeeper Wallis Lapsley, but the ball rebounded off his gloves and took a favorable roll for the visitors as it met Ballard McBride's boot before meeting the back of the net. Already in the midst of a sensational rookie season, Ballard McBride continues to light up the scoresheet. With the day's deciding goal, Ballard McBride now has his ninth goal of the season ""î leading all Gauchos in goals scored. He also has a pair of assists to his name, but the Australian's ability to produce off the bench has been nothing short of phenomenal this year. Following the back-to-back goals, the remainder of the match proved to be a cagey affair with a total of 38 fouls across the two teams. Nevertheless, even with UC Davis outshooting UCSB 19 to 9, the Gauchos managed to hold on through two periods of extra time and secure a point on the road. The performance from UCSB's sophomore goalkeeper, Ben Roach, was also worth noting as his nine total saves kept his side in it through all 110 minutes of play. The men's soccer postseason starts in two weeks for the Gauchos, but the team still has a pair of road games ahead of them before they can think about playoff glory. For now, all eyes remain on the Big West and the conference berths will depend upon how these final fixtures play out. UCSB travels south to CSUN this Saturday, Oct. 26, for their penultimate regular season conference matchup ""î kickoff is set for 7 p.m.

The Gauchos last took the field against rival Cal Poly on Sunday, and after two overtime periods, neither team prevailed and the game ended in a draw. This makes the ""òChos 0-1-1 in their last two games after winning three straight up until that point, and their upcoming stretch of games will greatly affect the Big West standings. Currently, UCSB is tied with UCI at fourth place in the Big West with an overall record of 6-4-4 and a conference record of 2-1-1. The next few games will be key if the Gauchos have conference title hopes as they could either separate themselves from the pack and prove that they belong, or they could hit a rough patch and find themselves in a difficult hole to get out of. Thursday's opponent, Cal State Fullerton, is sitting atop the Big West standings at the moment, with an overall record of 10-2-3 and a conference record of 3-0-2. This matchup is between two of the top teams in the Big West and both teams will surely bring their best stuff to this one, as it provides an opportunity for both teams to gain a statement win early in conference play. While this is an important game, there is certainly no guarantee of a win for the Gauchos, as Fullerton has proved difficult to beat at home this year, sporting a 6-1-1 record at Titan Stadium. The Titans are also the hottest team in the Big West at the moment having won or tied all of their last 11 games. The outcome of Thursday's game will most likely be decided by which offense can create the most goal-scoring opportunities for themselves because UCSB and CSUF have the two best offenses in the Big West at this point of the season. Fullerton has by far the most goals out of all the Big West teams with 31 in 15 games, but Santa Barbara ranks second with 21 goals scored in their 14 games played, so both teams are capable of putting the ball in the net. While both squads tend to execute well as a team on the offensive end, there are also a number of All-Conference caliber performers on either team that have the ability to change a game in the blink of an eye. The top three goal scorers in the Big West will all be on the field on Thursday, with Shaelan Murison on the Gauchos as well as Atlanta Primus and Maddie Bennett for the Titans. Those three players have combined for 30 goals this year. The top four assist leaders in the Big West conference will also be featured in this game. Fullerton and Santa Barbara are two teams known mostly for their offensive ability, and the talent they each have on that side of the field can often overshadow the defensive ability for both teams. UCSB and CSUF rank second and third in goals allowed average, and the Gauchos hold a narrow edge with a .94 GAA compared to the Titans .95 GAA. The goalkeeper matchup will also be an area to watch to see if senior keeper Hanna DeWeese can come up big for the Gauchos as she has many times this season and on the other side, if redshirt freshman Noa Schumacher can keep up her solid play in one of the biggest games of the season. The game will be played at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 24 at Titan Stadium in Fullerton.

Despite having their 13-game win streak snapped at the hands of No. 21 Hawai'i last week, the squad stood strong in what was another fierce rendition of the Blue and Green rivalry. The Gauchos won two hard-fought sets to take an early lead before the Mustangs charged back with an impressive 25-15 third set. Fortunately for the ""òChos, a fourth set was all that was needed to walk away with a win. You could hardly tell a difference when you look at the team stats overall though. Cal Poly actually had more kills, albeit by just two. Errors were even at 22 while the Mustangs also had a slight lead in total attempts. Someone digging through the individual numbers would be hard-pressed to find something of much significance either ""î though they would find out that there is one thing in particular that separated these two teams. A Mustang led both teams in kills, assists and digs. The immediate question then is how did the Gauchos come out on top, despite posting equal or inferior numbers across the board? Oh, and I forgot to mention, Big West superstar Lindsey Ruddins was sidelined with an injury she picked up earlier in the week. This means that UCSB toppled their archrivals ""î who are currently in a dogfight for first place with the Gauchos, I might add ""î a mere week after Hawai'i snapped their 13-game win streak without Lindsey Ruddins. Cal Poly's Maia Dvoracek led both teams with 19 kills, but UCSB's Tallulah Froley was right there with 16 followed by Torre Glasker's 10. That list was the same for errors, as each posted 9,6 and 6, respectively. Mustang Avalon DeNecochea dominated the assist game with 42 helpers, but only two of her teammates even recorded an assist at all. Those players were Mika Dickson and Jessica McRoskey, who recorded 3 and 1. Behind DeNecochea were Gauchos Olivia Lovenberg and Romoni Vivao who each dished out their own fair share of helpers at 23 and 17, respectively. Both Dickson and Lea Ungar each had a service ace for the Mustangs, but it stopped there. Vivao, Lovenberg, Zoe Fleck and Kobie Jimenez all served up two of their own plates while Glasker added one to make it 9 service aces for the Gauchos. What happened Saturday night was nothing short of extraordinary. It's only right that we place into the spotlight the many names that have stamped their mark in this incredible season for UCSB. Dickson did lead both teams in digs with her 17, but Glasker shined once again with 16 and Lovenberg decided to add 11 of her own. Block assists ""î yes, block assists ""î will pretty much show you all Gauchos. UCSB's 20-8 domination in block assists suggests that there was both movement on the court, but also a will. As cliche as it sounds, it was the will to win. Coming off their biggest loss of the season and taken down by the very team relentlessly tracking them to the top of the conference, the Gauchos dominated every inch of that hardwood flooring as they chased down every ball all night long. If there was a misplay on the ball, there was always someone there. The depth of this team is just unbelievable. Even without one of the best players in college volleyball, UCSB took a huge step forward in their quest for glory after defeating Cal Poly 3-1. The Gauchos will first travel to Davis (who are just outside the top three of UCSB, Cal Poly and Hawai'i) and will be looking to start their last big push after having lost to Hawai'i last week.
UCSB will have Friday off before making the trip to Riverside on Saturday where underestimating their opponent may prove fatal. Riverside is currently last in the Big West with a 1-6 record in conference play and a 5-13 record overall. Both of these teams have already made the trip out to the Thunderdome this season and both have been swept out of town. Ruddins has yet to be confirmed for either matchup, but Saturday's Blue-Green showing tells us the expectation should be nothing short of two victories for the Gauchos. The Gauchos will play UC Davis this Thursday at 7 p.m. before a southern trip to UC Riverside for kickoff at 5 p.m. on Saturday.

The team only dropped a single match in October and currently remains undefeated away from home. Nevertheless, the Blue and Gold will be looking forward to ending conference play on a high note, especially since the top seed in the Big West standings has yet to be determined.† After a 1-1 double overtime tie to UC Davis earlier in the week, the Gauchos then traveled to CSUN where they shared the points once again in a 0-0 draw. This result now brings UCSB's overall record on the season to 10-3-4, a win percentage of .706, and their conference record to 3-1-2. In terms of the conference table, UCSB occupies the third spot with their 11 total points, only trailing UC Irvine and UC Davis who both have 13 points themselves.† An injury update is in order, as senior defenders Faouzi Taieb and Mateo Restrepo Mejia returned to Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg's squad ""î both players had been recovering from knocks they had sustained earlier in October.† Saturday's action started off fairly back and forth with both teams getting their shots in early. Mejia would make his return in the sixth minute of play after the head coach decided to opt for a more veteran approach by subbing out sophomore defender Ryan Johnson.† The Gauchos saw plenty of set piece chances in the first half of play, which would be a recurring theme as the visitors would finish with 10 corner kicks and the hosts only three. Still, UCSB didn't manage to snag a decider during these golden opportunities. Intensity from both sides then wavered a bit as the whistle came and marked the end of the first half of action.† The start of the second half did see the tides turn more in UCSB's favor, when the Gauchos immediately tested CSUN's goalkeeper David Preys from the get-go. Senior forward Will Baynham landed his shot and was then followed up by senior midfielder Sahid Conteh's only seconds later, and both chances demanded a save from Preys.† By the 64th minute, the first and only booking of the match was then awarded to Conteh for a hard challenge.† At minute 79, Preys was subbed off for the Matadors' second goalkeeper, junior Paul Lewis. Lewis would enter during the game's most heated period as both teams desperately tried to land a winner; he would then later save a shot from UCSB's senior defender Noah Billingsley as time wound down and the whistle signaled the end of regulation with extra time needed.† Taieb would make his return at the beginning of overtime as he was subbed on for junior defender William Gillingham. Billingsley went on to make the only on-target shot of overtime, which was saved by Lewis, with the match ultimately ending as a stalemate.† Nevertheless, the draw remains somewhat favorable for the Gauchos as it upholds their undefeated away record and keeps them still in the race for the top seed in the Big West standings. The Gauchos will have plenty of time to rest up with no midweek game, but they'll return to action this weekend for another installment of the Blue-Green rivalry. This'll be their last match of the regular season as the team begins to prep for their playoff aspirations.† UCSB travels to Cal Poly next Saturday, Nov. 2, with kick-off scheduled for 5:00 p.m.

The Gauchos led both teams in hitting percentage and posted more than double the amount of blocks.† The first set was all UCSB, who showcased a stout defense led by Deni Wilson and Kjia Rivers, each with five blocks.† The second set provided much more drama as the Aggies were able to tie it up after a 10-3 start for the Gauchos.† A pivotal block by the tandem of Tallulah Froley and Rowan Ennis won the set for the Gauchos just moments after Ruddins broke a 23-23 tie. Aggie Lauren Matias had a solid night with 14 kills, one service ace and six digs, but her pedestrian .294 hitting percentage just didn't have the support needed for her team to get the win. Jane Seslar should be noted as well after having posted 27 assists and 12 digs.† Reigning Big West Player of the Week Froley joined the attack and added another 10 kills in the must-win victory for the Gauchos.† UC Riverside, if it were to be, perhaps posed the greatest threat to the Gauchos.

sports,Murison Hat-Trick Fuels UCSB's Win Against Hawai'i,29-Oct-19,10:27 AM,['Kunal Mehta'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-29/murison-hat-trick-fuels-ucsbs-win-against-hawaii/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB women's soccer team picked up their third win in conference play in a dominating fashion against Hawai'i, putting the squad at an overall record of 7-4-5 (3-1-2 in conference play.) Following a hat trick from senior forward Shaelan Murison, the Gauchos were able to win fairly comfortably. 

Santa Barbara entered this game after ending two consecutive matchups in a tie. In their most recent matchup against Cal State Fullerton, the team was unable to gain the edge despite multiple chances in the overtime periods. Even with the tie, there were many positives to take away from the matchup, including the strong effort by the Gauchos on defense.

Hawai'i, 5-7-3 overall, had struggled earlier in the season but has rebounded nicely as the Rainbow Wahine have won three of their past five matchups, with the other two being ties. Much of their success as of late can be attributed to the strong play of sophomore defender Kayla Ryan, who not only leads the team with five goals but is also the anchor of the Hawai'i defense. To have success in this matchup, the Gauchos had to limit the amount of opportunities for Ryan to score. UC Santa Barbara got off to a quick start as Murison was able to get past the defense to score her first goal of the game in the seventh minute of the match. Shortly thereafter, Murison recorded her second goal in the 27th minute after flying past numerous Rainbow Wahine defenders and striking the ball past the outstretched arms of the Hawai'i goalkeeper. 

Despite being down by two points, the Rainbow Wahine continued to put pressure on the Gauchos and were eventually rewarded with a penalty kick in the 51st minute. Ryan calmly found the back of the net while also making it a one-score game for the Rainbow Wahine.† For the Gauchos, this is often the time of the game where they would struggle to put teams away after obtaining an early lead. That being said, the Gauchos were able to score their third goal of the game with a beautiful shot from sophomore forward Jessica Wright, giving them a two-goal advantage in the 78th minute. A little over ten minutes later, Murison would record her hat trick and put the game out of reach for Hawai'i.

There are many positives to take away from this match, but the one that really sticks out is the improved play of the Gauchos' forwards. One of the main struggles this year has been finding the back of the net when Murison is being double teamed by opposing teams. The Gauchos have seemed to address this issue, as their forwards are starting to play with much more pace; this not only puts them in better scoring opportunities but also allows Murison to be free from double teams.† In addition to their improvement on the offensive side of the field, senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese continues to impress as she has now recorded a total of 47 saves along with a save percentage of 74%. For the Gauchos to continue their strong play, DeWeese will need to continue anchoring the defense and providing veteran leadership for the young squad.† With just a couple games left in the regular season, UCSB is currently third in the Big West Conference standings and is only one win away from being tied for first place. If the Gauchos are able to win their next two matchups, it will put them in a fantastic position to be either the No. 1 or No. 2 seed heading into the Big West Tournament.

sports,No. 4 UCSB Men's Water Polo Snaps Losing Streak With Pair of Impressive Wins,29-Oct-19,10:14 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-29/no-4-ucsb-mens-water-polo-snaps-losing-streak-with-pair-of-impressive-wins/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The UCSB men's water polo team earned its first two wins of October this weekend, snapping a five-game losing streak with wins over No. 7 Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 8 Cal on Sunday. The wins pushed the No. 4 Gauchos' record to 17-5 on the season and 1-1 in Golden Coast Conference play. Just like all but one of the games UCSB lost during its slump, both games this weekend came down to the final minutes. The Gauchos hung on to beat the Beach 11-10 despite a last-minute LBSU goal and poured in four goals in overtime to beat the Golden Bears 13-10. Sophomore driver Nathan Puentes was the star of the weekend with nine goals across the two games. Puentes notched a double hat trick against Cal in the most individually dominant performance by any Gaucho this season and rattled the cage three different times in overtime to create the margin of victory all on his own. The sophomore posted his first hat trick entirely in the first half but was forced to leave the game for a spell in the second half due to an injury. That Puentes was able to overcome that injury and return to the water to post a second hat trick is a testament to his fortitude. Of course, with nine goals over the weekend, Sunday's game wasn't the only one Puentes left his mark on. The sophomore driver notched his first three goals of the weekend on Saturday against Long Beach State, including a penalty-shot goal with four minutes left in the fourth quarter that put the Gauchos ahead for good. Junior attacker Cole Brosnan also posted a hat trick against the Beach, and senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic contributed to four total points with a goal and three assists.† The first half against Long Beach State was the definition of back-and-forth, with neither team able to gain more than a one-goal lead. The Beach closed the half up 6-5 thanks to two goals in the final two minutes, both assisted by junior attacker Nemanja Bakic. The second half, on the other hand, began with three straight Gaucho goals. Brosnan scored two of those goals, while junior defender Mason McQuet scored the third with two minutes left in the third quarter.† A goal from Gvozdanovic opened up the fourth quarter and pushed the UCSB lead to 9-7, but the Beach quickly battled back with two goals to tie the game up at nine apiece with just over four minutes to go. That, of course, set the stage for Puentes' go-ahead penalty shot, and senior driver Tommy Fellner added one more goal for insurance in the final minute of the game. One final LBSU goal with 28 seconds left in the game cut the lead to one, but the Gauchos held on for their first win in a one-goal game this season. Four of UCSB's losses during their five-game losing streak were by one goal, making their slim victory against LBSU that much sweeter. As satisfying as Saturday's win was for the Gauchos, they didn't have much time to rest on their laurels. Instead, the team had to drive right back up Highway 101 and get ready to host Cal the next day. Sunday's game was a rematch and a chance for the Golden Bears to get revenge for UCSB's 8-5 victory on Sept. 8. With two minutes left in the fourth quarter, and Cal clinging to a 9-8 lead, it appeared for a moment that the visitors were going to get that revenge, despite Puentes' hat trick. Enter sophomore attacker Leo Yuno, who netted an even-strength goal just as the clock ticked under two minutes and tied the game up at nine. Both teams had their chances to break the deadlock but neither was able to convert. The Nathan Puentes one-man band came roaring back to life in overtime, first with a penalty shot followed by two even-strength goals. Cal could muster only one goal in response, sealing the dramatic Gaucho victory. Sophomore goalie Danny Roland made life difficult for the Berkeley attackers all day long with 13 saves and three steals. Gvozdanovic helped him out with three steals of his own and also dished out three assists on the offensive end. The Gauchos must now prepare to take on UC Irvine on Saturday at Campus Pool. The 12 p.m. game is UCSB's last home game of the season, so a Senior Day ceremony will take place immediately prior to the game.

sports,No. 19 UCSB To Take On Rival Cal Poly in Final Regular Season Game,31-Oct-19,11:32 AM,['Richard Benites'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/no-19-ucsb-to-take-on-rival-cal-poly-in-final-regular-season-game/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus After a dominating 3-1 victory when UC Santa Barbara hosted Cal Poly earlier in the season, the Gauchos will now travel north for the second installment of the ever-enthralling Blue-Green rivalry. Plenty will be on the line and several storylines will come to fruition as the clash between UCSB and Cal Poly will mean much more than just bragging rights this time around. With the regular season now winding down and the postseason only a week away, a quick refresher is in order with regard to the current state of UCSB's men's soccer campaign. The Gauchos currently boast an overall record of 10-3-4 on the season, a win percentage of .706 and have still yet to drop a match on the road through seven away fixtures. In addition, the team has only allowed a single loss in their past 14 outings. This spectacular run is a testament to the Gauchos' presently outstanding form and is the reason why NCAA Men's Soccer D1 rankings have them as a top-20 program in the nation, according to the latest United Soccer Coaches' poll. In terms of the league standings, the Gauchos occupy the third seed in the Big West with their conference record of 3-1-2. With 11 points on hand, UCSB only trails UC Irvine and UC Davis, who both have 13 points and share the standings' top seed ""î with the latter currently holding the tiebreaker. Considering that only a single game remains in conference play, the Big West's seeding may still be shaken up following the final fixture. However, depending on the results of the Irvine and Davis games, the Gauchos still have a chance at landing that coveted first-place berth in the Big West. Still, UCSB must focus on giving it their all this Saturday because the fourth-place team can still overtake them with their nine points ""î and that fourth-place team is none other than Cal Poly. On the season, Cal Poly currently stands at an overall record of 7-7-1, and for that they can thank their home record of 6-2. The Mustangs' 3-3 conference record also means that they're still in it and will be vying for a third-place finish in the Big West ""î that is unless the Gauchos have something to say about it. Regardless of the outcome for either side, conference standing is a motivator but postseason glory is the ultimate goal since these playoff berths may make or break a team's Big West aspirations. As always, there'll be no love lost between the Gauchos and the Mustangs. UCSB retains the historical advantage in this one, as the Blue leads in the all-time series with a record of 48-20-10 over the Green. The Gauchos also hold the immediate advantage, considering the aforementioned 3-1 home victory earlier in the season and the team's current undefeated record on the road. Ones to watch for the Gauchos include freshman midfielder Finn Ballard McBride and junior forward Rodney Michael. Ballard McBride's ability to produce, even when often playing the role of a super sub, makes his case for UCSB's MVP for him. Leading his side in scoring for the season with 9 goals, all while adding a pair of assists to his name, Ballard McBride is in the midst of a remarkable rookie season and his knack for finding the back of the net will help him prolong his success. Tied for team-leading in playmaking, Michael has assisted 6 goals this season whilst filling up the stat sheet with another 4 goals on his behalf. As a ferocious dribbler, Michael's intensity helps to bring his side to that next level with the amount of chances he creates. He went out with an injury in the game against UC Irvine a couple weeks ago, but all signs point to him returning in the final game of the season. We can expect brilliant link-up play from both Ballard McBride and Michael come Saturday, but the sky's the limit concerning what these two can help achieve in the postseason. As for Cal Poly, junior midfielder Emmanuel Perez brings the offense for the Mustangs. With 9 goals and 3 assists on the season, Perez is the clear-cut danger man and will surely be in UCSB's thoughts once the game plan is enacted. Fresh off a 2-0 road loss to Irvine, Cal Poly will want to bounce back at home and try to surpass their rivals in the Big West standings. Meanwhile, the Gauchos remain in the hunt for a first-place conference finish and will want to prove their ranking as No. 19. Winning away games is essential to maintaining a solid RPI, the rating percentage index that is used to determine our position in the NCAA tournament, and locking down a victory in this matcup will go a long way in ensuring that UCSB hosts a first-round matchup at Harder Stadium. All this and more will be in store for fans as this game is shaping up to be an exciting conclusion to the regular season ""î and yet another memorable edition to the Blue-Green rivalry. UCSB travels to Cal Poly this Saturday, Nov. 2, as kickoff time is set for 5 p.m. sharp.

sports,No. 4 Gauchos Looking To Maintain Win-Streak Against No. 14 UCI,31-Oct-19,11:22 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/no-4-gauchos-looking-to-maintain-win-streak-against-no-14-uci/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The UCSB men's water polo team broke a long losing streak with two wins last weekend. Now, they'll get a chance to prolong the slide of one of their conference rivals. The Gauchos host UC Irvine on Saturday at Campus Pool in their first matchup of the season. The No. 14 Anteaters have lost seven games in a row and sit at 6-10 overall and 0-2 in Golden Coast Conference (GCC) play. A losing team is a hungry team, so UCI will jump into the pool with plenty of motivation to pull off the upset. UCSB knows that feeling well. The Gauchos snapped their five-game losing streak with wins over No. 6 Long Beach State and No. 8 California last weekend, finally securing close wins after losing several heartbreakers. The two wins pushed UCSB to 17-5 this season and 1-1 in the GCC, keeping the team ranked at No. 4 in the nation. Even with a couple wins and a little momentum under their belts, the Gauchos still can't afford to take the Anteaters lightly, despite UCI's losing record and extended rough patch. That's because the Anteaters' record and current rough patch aren't as bad as they might first appear to be. All of the Anteaters' 10 losses have come against higher-ranked teams, and UCI has beaten No. 9 UC San Diego and No. 13 LMU. Irvine lacks an on-paper intimidation factor, but they're without a doubt a capable water polo team. The Anteaters have rebounded after a tough four-game offensive stretch to start the season and have scored at least 10 goals in all but four of their games since then. The Anteater attack has one main point of the spear: junior utility Jason Evezard. The South African athlete has 33 goals this season, almost 20 more than the next Irvine attacker on the list. Evezard set the UCI program record for goals in a match earlier this season with nine against Cal Baptist. Stopping Evezard, or at least limiting him, will be a huge priority for the UCSB defense. The junior hasn't scored more than 2 goals in any game during the Anteaters' seven-game losing streak, and his supporting cast has struggled to make up for that. Freshman Harrison Land started most of the season in goal for Irvine but hasn't played since Oct. 5. Senior Chandler Mankins and freshman Collin Winters have alternated as goalies in Land's stead, but neither have been able to help reverse UCI's fortunes. Whichever Irvine goalie is in the water will be facing off against a Gaucho attack that can get its goals from a wide variety of players. Sophomore driver Nathan Puentes scored 6 goals himself against Cal last Sunday, but that was a deviation from the norm. Both Brosnan brothers, junior attacker Cole and sophomore driver Ryan, have been effective on the attack all season, and sophomore attacker Sam Nangle, redshirt sophomore Leo Yuno and senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic can all light it up as well. Every Gaucho attacker will have an opportunity to make noise against a UCI defense that has allowed double-digit goals in all but three games this season. If that opportunity isn't enough, UCSB will have the added motivation of Senior Day proceedings before the game. Saturday's game is the team's last home game of the season, making this the last opportunity for seniors Gvozdanovic, Tommy Fellner and Jacob Halle to play in front of the Campus Pool crowd in their careers. The fact that the Gauchos are graduating only three players throws the youth of this UCSB team into focus. These three seniors have provided experience and guidance for their younger teammates and have earned the ceremony they'll receive before the game. UCSB hosts UC Irvine on Saturday at 12 p.m. at Campus Pool.

sports,UCSB Women's Soccer Sets Sights on First-Place Finish,31-Oct-19,11:26 AM,['Jake Ciccone'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/ucsb-womens-soccer-sets-sights-on-first-place-finish/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus As we head down the final stretch of the 2019 UC Santa Barbara women's soccer season, the Gauchos are very much in position to finish in the top four of the Big West standings and qualify for the conference tournament for the second year in a row. UCSB is currently tied for third place in the conference with a record of 3-1-2 in Big West play and 7-4-5 overall. There are two regular season games remaining against UC Riverside and UC Irvine, and the Gauchos have the luxury of playing both games within the friendly confines of Harder Stadium. The first of the two remaining games will be played on Friday, where the ""òChos will take on the struggling Highlanders of UC Riverside. Riverside is currently sitting in last place in the Big West with a 1-5 conference record, with their lone win coming last week in a home game against UC Davis. That win over Davis also happens to be their only win in their last 10 matchups, and they have only mustered 4 goals over that entire stretch. However, this last rough stretch has not been the only time Riverside has struggled to score the ball. They have only scored 8 goals over the course of the entire season, and when you compare that to the 28 goals they've given up, it's easy to see why the Highlanders have struggled so mightily. In terms of a game plan for Friday, the Gauchos must look to keep junior forward Alexis Vera away from the goal, because she has proven to be the most capable scorer for Riverside with her team-leading 4 goals on the season, including a 2-goal game in their single conference win against Davis. The Gaucho defense has come up big many times this season, as their .94 goals against average shows, and another strong defensive outing should be enough for them to take this game against Riverside at home. After the game against Riverside, the Gauchos will get a day off on Saturday before suiting up again for Sunday's season finale and senior night against UC Irvine, where the six seniors on this year's roster will hopefully leave their final game at Harder Stadium with a win.
Irvine is another team that is hungry to claim one of those top-four spots in Big West; they currently reside outside of the conference tournament picture in fifth place with a 3-2-1 record. They won their last game against Long Beach on their senior night, so they will be looking to build on that momentum over their final games of the season. The Anteaters have struggled offensively throughout the season and their offensive struggles have extended into Big West play, where they are averaging only .83 goals scored per game. But even though nothing comes easy for them on offense, they are currently over .500 in conference play on the strength of their improved defense. Coming into non-conference play, the Anteaters were 1-9 and allowed 26 goals in those 10 games. But in the six Big West conference games since, they have only allowed 6 goals and have put themselves in much better positions to win games. This drastic turnaround is partly due to the difficult schedule played by the Anteaters that featured three top-10 opponents in their non-conference schedule. It was those difficult challenges that have prepared Irvine for later in the season when it matters. In order for the Gauchos to emerge victorious on senior night, they must first limit the less-than-stellar offensive attack provided by the ""òEaters and then relentlessly attack their defense ""î and hope to eventually have a ball or two slip through the cracks. The game against Riverside will be played on Friday at 7 p.m., and the Irvine game will take place on Sunday at 2 p.m.

sports,UCSB Women's Volleyball Heads to Hawai'i For Pivotal Rematch,31-Oct-19,11:12 AM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-10-31/ucsb-womens-volleyball-heads-to-hawaii-for-pivotal-rematch/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara women's volleyball team improved to a remarkable 19-2 overall record after having toppled Long Beach State 3-1 (25-22, 22-25, 31-29, 25-15) in a match that featured 43 ties and 20 lead changes. The Gauchos have officially taken a huge step forward, as this 19th win makes it the most in a season under Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch and the most since 2011. The win was Welch's 99th win since 2013, the start of her career with the Gauchos, and she'll be looking to clinch number 100 this Friday at Hawai'i. Lindsey Ruddins posted 21 kills to tie her season high while Olivia Lovenberg was just one dig away from a 23-assist double-double. It was truly a hectic night with both teams trading ferocious runs until the very end. The Gauchos were the more clinical and composed of the two though, ultimately capitalizing on The Beach's mistakes. UCSB committed eight fewer errors than Long Beach State while also stealing points with 6 service aces. The victory means UCSB has staved off Cal Poly, as both currently sit at 9-1 in the conference. The Gauchos hold the head-to-head tiebreaker, and thus first place, but both programs are certainly anticipating their next and final meeting at the Mott Athletic Center on Nov. 9. With just six games left to play and both Cal Poly and Hawai'i hot on their trail, UCSB is set to take on Hawai'i at the Stan Sheriff Center this Friday. The Rainbow Wahine are third in the Big West but are just one game behind UCSB and Cal Poly while also holding the longest current win streak in the conference at five games. Hawai'i are coming off back-to-back sweeps against both Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine, meaning they have swept the season series against both of those programs every year since 2011. The Rainbow Wahine ultimately rejoined the Big West in 2012 after having spent the previous 16 years in the Western Athletic Conference, where they won 71 team championships and more than 175 individual championships with a combined 14 men's and women's sports. There was a period, however, from 1984-1996 where the Big West housed all of UH's women's sports during its inauguration of women's sports. It was in this conference that the women's volleyball team would claim the 1987 national championship under legendary Head Coach (and former UCSB men's volleyball player) Dave Shoji. Shoji has since retired, as the Rainbow Wahine have set sail under the guidance of helmsman Robyn Ah Mow who is surely setting her sights on the promised land after back-to-back first-round exits in the NCAA tournament. Currently, the Rainbow Wahine are led by outside hitter Hanna Hellvig who leads the team with 252 kills produced at a 3.04 per set clip, but UCSB's top three killers have been more potent in comparison to their Hawai'i counterparts, save for Hawai'i's fourth-highest scorer, Brooke Van Sickle, whose 126 kills surpasses Deni Wilson's 114. Hawai'i will be rolling out a lineup that features five players with triple-digit kills ""î one more than UCSB's four. So while Lindsey Ruddins leads the way with an astronomical 318 Hawai'i's attacking depth is simply unmatched. Looking head-to-head, Hawai'i infamously ended UCSB's 13-game run just five games ago after holding Ruddins to just 12 kills and a .216 hitting percentage. Ruddins is currently ranked 18th in the country with 4.54 kills per set while not a single member of the Rainbow Wahine is ranked in the top 50. On the other hand, Hawai'i junior Skyler Williams and freshman Amber Igiede find themselves ranked 23rd and 43rd respectively in hitting percentage; the top 50 rounds itself out without a single Gaucho. Hawai'i will be hoping that the home-court advantage will give them the edge this time after tenaciously invading the Thunderdome just two weeks ago. Welch's squad, however, will be looking for revenge as their push for glory continues. Hawai'i will host UCSB this Friday at the Stan Sheriff Center, when the match kicks off at 10 p.m. PST.

Because the Gauchos finished in one of the top two spots in the conference standings, they get a bye in the first round of the Big West Tournament (BWT) and will host a match next weekend. The Mustangs dropped to a 3-4 conference record and a 7-8-1 overall record with the loss, and their sixth place finish in the Big West set them up with a home match against CSUF in the first round of the BWT. Cal Poly started the match on the attack.  The team seemed to be motivated by the sold-out crowd of 11,075 fans that marked the largest crowd to attend an NCAA soccer match this season. An early shot in the third minute by graduate transfer Colin Hyatt forced UCSB goalkeeper Ben Roach to make a diving save, as the Mustangs had all the momentum early on. It was the Gaucho counterattack ""î that has been deadly all year long ""î that struck first, however, when senior Thibault Candia got the ball in the midfield in the 19th minute.  Candia sent the ball over to freshman Finn Ballard McBride, who passed it out to newly-returned forward Rodney Michael on the right wing. Michael then drove in a low cross over to Will Baynham near the edge of the box. Baynham faked one way, set the ball up with his right foot and lasered a shot into the bottom-left corner of the goal to give UCSB a 1-0 lead in the 21st minute. The Gauchos seemed content with defending in the first half, moving away from the typical possession-style offense that they have played throughout the season. The Mustangs ended up taking 19 shots to UCSB's three by the end of the game; however, the defense did a good job of contesting and not giving up great shot angles. Players on both sides of the Blue-Green rivalry always say that strategy goes by the wayside when these two teams match up due to the physical nature of their games. UCSB conceded a little too much after they scored the opening goal, and Cal Poly continued to apply pressure as the first half wore on. Forward Emmanuel Perez initiated one of the best chances of the night for the Mustangs in the 32nd minute when he squeezed past the Gaucho backline to put a shot on target. Roach blocked it but had to make two more spectacular saves in a row as the ball ricocheted right back to Hyatt who was wide-open in the box. Not many keepers beside the reigning Big West Defensive Player of the Week could have made those saves, but luckily for UCSB, Roach is on the roster and he kept the team ahead going into halftime. The second half kicked off similarly to the first, and both teams went back and forth for the first 20 minutes. In the 67th minute, senior defender Noah Billingsley stole the ball in the attacking third and sent a pass out to Michael who again found Baynham in the box. Baynham attempted a cross that deflected off a Cal Poly defender into the goal, doubling the Gauchos' lead and essentially putting an end to the game. This was a huge win for UCSB, both in terms of conference seeding as it earned them the first-round bye and in terms of the team's place in the national standings. A solid showing in the Big West Tournament should earn the Gauchos an invitation to the NCAA Tournament, and Harder Stadium could possibly host a UCSB NCAA Tournament game for the first time since 2015.† The Gauchos will need to focus on the conference tournament before any national aspirations get in the way, but all signs are pointing to a deep postseason run for this team.

After hitting .419 in the third set, they just couldn't keep it together as they hit .067 and committed 6 errors in the fourth to give Hawai'i the tie.† But they also gave them the momentum.† Hawai'i would go on to take the last set 17-15 and the match 3-2 (25-19, 22-25, 21-25, 25-18, 17-15).† Ruddins added 14 digs for the 27-kill double-double, freshman right side Tallulah Froley tied her career-high with 16 kills and freshman setter Romoni Vivao posted a 21-assist double-double. Unfortunately, these efforts were not enough to dig the Gauchos out of the hole they had dug for themselves.† Additionally, despite fine performances from sophomore setter Olivia Lovenberg, who led the Gauchos with 25 assists, and sophomore libero Zoe Fleck, who led the squad with 24 digs, the fourth-set hurdle of Norene Iosia's 4 service aces was simply too much.† Iosia posted a 33-assist, 16-dig double-double, and her service snatched 6 points for her team amidst a 7-point run that saw Hawai'i run away with the fourth set.† Hawai'i recorded their 14th game with double-digit blocks despite getting out-blocked by the Gauchos 13-10. Hawai'i had the upper hand in kills (67-62), assists (64-55) and service aces (6-2), but they were out-dug (86-75) by the Gauchos. Highlights for the Rainbow Wahine include freshman Hanna Hellvig, who posted a career-high 19 kills, junior Rika Okino, who recorded a match- and career-high 25 digs, and Iosia, who posted her 14th double-double of the season while playing perhaps the most important role for Hawai'i this game.† Despite this recent loss, UCSB will be hard-struck to doubt themselves for their next match against archrival Cal Poly, considering they toppled the Mustangs just a mere week after losing to Hawai'i five games ago. But nerves will be high nonetheless as the Gauchos continue their push for hardware with the season coming to a close.† With just five games left, Cal Poly will host yet another rendition of the Blue-Green rivalry, as the Gauchos will head north for a clash of titans between two of the best the Big West has to offer.† Saturday's match at Cal Poly will kick off at 7 p.m.††

A win over Riverside and a tie against Irvine secured Santa Barbara a 4-1-3 conference record and a second-place finish in the regular season conference standings. Now, the Gauchos will head to Fullerton where two more wins will clinch them their first Big West title and NCAA Tournament appearance since 2009.† In the semifinal, UCSB will face Cal State Northridge, the only Big West team to have defeated them during the regular season. The Gauchos and the Matadors faced off on Oct. 17 in Northridge and CSUN emerged victorious by a score of 1-0, thanks to a goal scored by Avery DeWitt in the 34th minute of that game.† Cal State Northridge is 11-6-3 on the season and 5-3 in Big West play. The team has five players who have recorded multiple goals on the season, so there are many capable offensive threats. Still, redshirt junior Bethany Fitzsimmons and sophomore Alexis White do a bulk of the scoring with 11combined goals between them.† The Matadors are by no means an elite offensive squad, but their solid team defense is capable of strangling teams and gutting out low-scoring wins. CSUN leads the Big West by a large margin with .77 goals allowed per game and they have recorded 10 shutouts, meaning they held a team scoreless in half of their games this season. They play great team defense but they are also anchored by quite possibly the best goalie in the Big West in sophomore Amanda Delgado. Delgado leads the Big West in both save percentage (.808) and goals allowed per game (.87) in just her first season as a full-time starter.†† Northridge has held steady since their win over UCSB, going 2-2 in their next four games with losses against UC Davis and Cal State Fullerton. They are not on any sort of hot streak coming into this tournament, but anything can happen in two games, especially with their elite defense; the Matadors are contenders as much as anyone for the Big West crown. UCSB is a vastly different team stylistically than CSUN because the Gauchos are a team that will go as far as their offense can take them. More specifically, the Gauchos will go as far as Shaelan Murison, frontrunner for Big West Player of the Year, can take them. That statement is not a hyperbole, because Murison has scored in 12 separate games this season, and UCSB's record in those games is 7-0-5. Murison leads the conference in goals with 17, a mark that ties her with Jennifer Borcich for the ninth most single-season goals in UCSB history. Murison received her fourth Big West Women's Soccer Offensive Player of the Week award last week, which is the most for any Gaucho in a single season. She has also recorded a goal or assist in eight of the last nine contests, so it is safe to say she is primed to lead the Gauchos into the Big West tournament.† But UCSB's future does not entirely rest on Murison's shoulders because her surrounding cast is full of excellent players such as junior Isabella Viana, who is second on the team in both goals and assists with 4 and 5, respectively. Sophomore Jessica Wright and freshman Dylan Lewis also both have 3 goals apiece this year and have been major contributors in several Gaucho wins.† UCSB will look to take the first step towards a conference title at 5 p.m. on Thursday in Fullerton.

As a result, the Gauchos will be awarded a first-round bye and won't be aware of their weekend opponent until the conclusion of Wednesday night's quarterfinal fixtures; specifically, the match between UCI and CSUN will be the one to watch. This added period of rest will be crucial for UCSB, as it means their semifinal opponent won't be as fresh come kickoff time. It also allows the team more time to prepare, especially important when considering the fact that the Gauchos couldn't grab a win against either side last time around. The Blue and Gold will be carrying a 11-3-4 overall record into the postseason, a win percentage of .722 and a conference record of 4-1-2, which netted them 14 total table points. In terms of national ranking, former No. 19 UCSB moved up four spots and are now considered a top-15 program in the latest United Soccer Coaches' poll for NCAA Division 1 Men's Soccer. They aren't the only Big West team to be nationally ranked, however, as their conference's first seed UC Davis hold the No. 24 spot.† After maintaining an 11-game undefeated streak not too long ago, UCSB's form hasn't been quite the same, as they've only won one match in their last four. Nevertheless, this is one of the most solid squads that Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has fielded in recent years. It's also worth mentioning that the Gauchos managed to never drop an away game throughout the entirety of the regular season.† UCSB's semifinalist opponent won't be decided until after the 7 p.m. quarterfinal between UCI and CSUN, but it's still worth previewing the two sides regardless.† The Anteaters finished their regular season with an overall record of 7-6-5 and a conference record of 4-2-1, good enough for the Big West third seed. They also finished with a 1-0 loss to CSUN, who they'll be playing in back-to-back games. Historically, the Gauchos hold the advantage in this matchup, as UCSB leads the all-time series by a record of 37-17-6. The Gauchos had gone five years without dropping a game to the Anteaters, but October's 2-1 loss to UCI in overtime ended that streak. As for CSUN, their 7-7-3 overall record entering the postseason only tells part of the story. The Matadors have been undefeated in their past three matches and will once again travel to UC Irvine in order to decide who progresses onto the next round of the Big West Tournament; my prediction is that the Matadors will win over their opponent again and go on to face the Gauchos in the semifinals.† For UCSB, senior forward Will Baynham is the man in form after scoring the opener against Cal Poly. On the season, Baynham is tied for second place in both goals and assists, with 6 of each category to his name. He'll most likely feature as the front man for the Gauchos, keeping the opposing center backs busy.† Christian Gutierrez, junior midfielder for the Anteaters, remains the top goalscorer for UC Irvine with a total of 6 to his name. Meanwhile, CSUN will have a lineup of a threatening trio of attackers in junior forward Daniel Trejo, senior forward Johnny Rodriguez ""î who each have 8 goals apiece ""î and senior midfielder Julio Rubio, who will act as the primary playmaker with 9 total assists on the season.† Once again, UCSB will find out its semifinal opponent following the conclusion of Wednesday night's quarterfinal bout between UCI and CSUN. Regardless, the Gauchos will host the victor this Saturday, Nov. 9, at 7 p.m. in Harder Stadium.†

The Gauchos never trailed during the 59-51 victory and were able to get key contributions from freshman players playing in their first official game. UCSB jumped out to a 17-2 lead early in the first quarter, with much of the run riding on the back of freshman center Ila Lane. The Bay Area native is a workhorse in the paint for the Gauchos, using her 6'4""ù frame to clear space and knock in a few early layups. ""úThe most impressive thing is how good Ila was,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said after the game. ""úHow much confidence she had and how much confidence we had around her ""¶ [Utah Valley] was giving up buckets at the rim because they wouldn't leave Ila. For a freshman big to be that aggressive and good early, it's [a] good sign for us.""ù Another first-year player that made an impact right away was guard Johnni Gonzalez, who was tasked with running the offense as the point guard when she entered the game with 4:24 to go in the first quarter. Gonzalez got her first assist as a Gaucho just one minute later when she passed to a wide-open Megan Ormiston, a jumper who put UCSB up 19-10 with just three minutes to play in the period.† The Wolverines would end the first quarter only down by nine points after a solid 10-4 run, but the Gauchos didn't take their foot off the gas pedal for too long as their lead ballooned to double-digits in the second quarter. Although Utah Valley actually shot a better percentage from the field in the second period, UCSB's volume of shots was far greater due to the team's advantage in rebounds.† The Gauchos went into the half up 37-23. The crowd of hundreds of local elementary schoolers ""î who were there for ""úSchool Day""ù ""î frantically urged UCSB on as the second half tipped off, but it was actually the Wolverines who came out of the break energized to play. Utah Valley relied on offensive rebounds and second-chance opportunities to slowly whittle the lead down, and a six-point swing in the last 30 seconds, which included a buzzer-beating three-point heave by senior Alexis Cortez, cut the Gaucho lead to just three by the end of the third quarter. ""úIt was offensive rebounds [that kept Utah Valley in the game],""ù Coach Henrickson explained. ""úWe gotta box out, the first five offensive rebounds were all guards ""¶ we gotta clean that up.""ù The fourth quarter started off as a back-and-forth affair with a bucket by Josie Williams getting the Wolverines within one point of the Gauchos' lead with 8:26 to go. That would be the closest that Utah Valley would get, however, as a Lane shot and then two consecutive Danae Miller threes pushed the Gaucho lead back to nine. Miller was the star of the show for UCSB, seemingly always having an answer for any Wolverine run. The junior guard shot a perfect 5 of 5 from the 3-point line, en route to a game-high 24 points, and was able to fit into more of a shooting-guard role instead of always having to facilitate. ""úDanae's rhythm, her timing [were impressive]. She took those shots at the right time,""ù Coach Henrickson said after the game. ""úI even told her that she has to be prepared to miss more shots this year, because she's going to take more ""¶ because we need her to, because she's capable of that.""ù

UCSB comes into the matchup with a 9-2 conference, 19-3 overall record and currently sits in second place in the Big West conference. The Mustangs have an identical 9-2 conference record but sit at 16-7 overall. Fortunately for the Gauchos, their win over Cal Poly at the Thunderdome earlier this season means they have a slight edge in the conference standings.† A loss this weekend, however, would level the playing field between these two teams and practically force the Gauchos to win all the games the rest of the way if they are to be crowned as the champions of the Big West.† Cal Poly traveled to the Thunderdome less than a month ago where they were routed at the hands of a Lindsey Ruddins-less Gaucho team.† Mustang Maia Dvoracek led both teams with 19 kills but also led both teams in errors with nine. Tallulah Froley filled in for Ruddins more than adequately as she posted 16 kills from a .250 hitting percentage and also added 4 digs and 2 blocks. Three strong sets from the Gauchos and a 10-1 run to win the third by Cal Poly resulted in the 3-1 UCSB win that saw Romoni Vivao, Olivia Lovenberg and Torre Glasker all post double-doubles. The match was very much a back-and-forth game that saw the Gauchos roll out a lineup bursting with confidence and composure, and they will be hoping this weekend's match is more of the same.† There's no reason to expect anything else, really, given the current success of both teams. Cal Poly does, however, own the superior head-to-head record at 7-3 over the past 10 meetings despite the Gauchos' 50-31 record overall against the Mustangs.† Cal Poly is currently coming off a loss against Hawai'i (1-3) despite the incredible performance of Dvoracek.† Dvoracek posted her sixth double-double of the season with a match-high (and just one short of her career-high) 29 kills and 13 digs. The match marked the 13th consecutive game with double-digit kills for the junior. The performance was good enough to earn her Big West Player of the Week honors for the fourth time this season, and she'll surely be looking to replicate that form against a Gaucho squad that will include Lindsey Ruddins.† This weekend should prove to be one of the defining moments of the season for Big West women's volleyball.† What will be remembered? What will everyone be talking about?† Could it be that those bleeding blue and gold look back on this moment as the kick-start that was the Gauchos' late-season push to win silverware? Will this be the moment when the Mustangs just simply charge on as they have so very often done against this Gaucho team?† Even if Hawai'i does run away with the championship, does it really matter if second place was lost to Green?† The Gauchos and the Mustangs. The Blue and the Green. Huge stakes on the line.† The match kicks off this Saturday at 7 p.m. at the Mott Athletics Center in San Luis Obispo.†

Forwards Will Baynham and Rodney Michael each scored a goal around halfway through the first period, and the Gauchos turned in another solid defensive performance, marking their third consecutive game without allowing a goal. CSUN came into this matchup on the heels of a textbook up-and-down season, which included wins against Ohio State and No. 1 Washington and losses to Sac State and Cal Poly. The Matadors had tied the Gauchos the last time these two teams met, although a few key players were missing from UCSB due to injuries. The Gauchos controlled the ball ""î and the game ""î from kickoff on Saturday night. The game plan for the home team was to play from the wings and try to send crosses into the box, something that Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg expanded on postgame. ""úI thought that Irvine [who CSUN defeated 3-2 in the quarterfinals] really struggled with getting service and being dangerous in the box, so that was obviously a point of emphasis for us,""ù Vom Steeg explained. ""úNot only to win the ball, but to play in the wide areas""¶ that led to the attacking players being able to get inside the box.""ù UCSB executed this plan perfectly, and about halfway through the first half, a golden opportunity arose. Matador defender Scott Williams slipped up around the 24th minute, and as he was lying on the ground, Gaucho forward Michael took the ball and sped past the CSUN backline, who were expecting a stoppage. He sent in a cross from the right wing to a streaking Baynham who tapped the ball into the back of the net for a 1-0 lead. The scoring wouldn't stop there, however, as five minutes later, senior defender Noah Billingsley took the ball up the left wing past the Matador defense. The Kiwi cut toward the box, and as the CSUN goalkeeper came out to meet him, he chipped the ball to Michael who was wide open in front of the goal, and Michael extended the lead to two. ""úAll week, we've been working on getting into the box and getting services in,""ù Michael said postgame. ""úI saw [Billingsley] go down the line and knew that all I had to do was get into the box; Noah played an excellent ball, and all I had to do was get my head on it.""ù The Gauchos would continue to press as the half wore on, yet couldn't get a third goal to put the game out of reach.  The other side of the pitch remained locked down, however. CSUN could only muster two shots in the period against the impenetrable UCSB backline, which for seemingly the first time all year included Billingsley, Faouzi Taieb and Hunter Ashworth all at the same time. International duty and injuries meant that the Gauchos had to continue to shuffle up the defense all season, but these three defensive stalwarts still haven't given up a goal in the games since their return. With their season on the line, the Matadors came out guns blazing to start off the second half. Two early shots by sophomore forward Wolfgang Prentice had the Gauchos on their toes early, yet goalkeeper Ben Roach never seemed to have a tough time stopping any shot that came his way.† UCSB weathered the CSUN push and settled into their possession-style of play as the second half wore on. Although they only had a couple prime goal-scoring opportunities after the two goals in the first period, this might have been one of the most impressive offensive performances for the team so far. The Gauchos managed to string together passes and hold onto the ball against a tough and desperate Matador team, and they ultimately finished the game with a 2-0 win. Looking ahead, UCSB will face off against No. 23 UC Davis in the Big West Tournament Finals.† Vom Steeg pointed out postgame that the win against CSUN should ensure that the Gauchos reach the NCAA Tournament outright, but a win against the Aggies in the conference championship game could potentially give the team a bye week and the opportunity to host their first game at Harder Stadium in the national tourney.† Last time the Aggies and Gauchos met up, the result was a 1-1 tie, but UCSB was missing key players Michael and Thibault Candia. With these two offensive stars back in the line-up, the Gauchos will head north to try to turn the tables and win their first Big West Championship since 2010.

In their last matchup, Santa Barbara finished with a tie against UC Irvine where the team was simply unable to find the back of the net in overtime. Senior forward Shaelan Murison and sophomore defender Lauren Hess scored 1 goal each for the ""òChos. After grabbing a 2-0 lead, UCSB gave up 2 straight goals that were only 42 seconds apart in the 80th minute of the matchup. The game would end in a tie as neither team was able to score in the overtime periods.† The Matadors, 11-7-3, were looking to pick up their 12th win of the season as well as their second win against the Gauchos. Cal State Northridge is led by junior redshift forward Bethany Fitzsimmons who has 6 goals and 2 assists on the season. On the defensive side of the field, sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Delgado anchors the defense as she has posted an impressive 76 saves along with a save percentage of 80%. Murison paced the Gauchos in the first half as the star forward put constant pressure on CSUN's defense. Despite having multiple attempts on goal in the first half, Delgado was able to redirect the shots away from goal. UCSB was the more aggressive team in the first half as the Gauchos had 11 shots in comparison to only 3 shots for Cal State Northridge. Even though the ""òChos were able to have more opportunities, the score was still 0-0 heading into halftime. 

The second half was much of the same as neither team was able to find the back of the net. Cal State Northridge did find their rhythm though as the Matadors were able to put 7 shots on frame but were still unable to score. Both goalkeepers had played really well entering regulation as they combined for a total of 15 saves in regulation. 

In overtime, sophomore forward Alexis White scored the golden goal to punch the Matadors' ticket to the Big West Conference final. It was a disappointing loss for Santa Barbara as the squad had multiple opportunities to take the lead during regulation.† Although UCSB did not finish the season the way they would have liked, it was still a very successful season ""î the team was able to finish with 8 wins. One of the main focuses for next season will be for the team to learn how to win the close games as they finished with 5 ties this season. With a year of experience for ""òChos, there is a lot of confidence amongst the team to grow and turns those ties into wins next season. 

That being said, it will be important for a scorer to emerge next season as this was the last collegiate match for star forward Shaelan Murison. Murison finished the year with a team leading with 17 goals and 7 assists. She was undoubtedly the team's best offensive player and her production will definitely be missed next year. 

Another player that will be missed is senior goalkeeper Hanna DeWeese who was incredible in front of goal this season. DeWeese tallied 5 shutouts, 47 saves and a save percentage of 74.6%.† The future is bright for the team however as there are many freshmen this year who will grow into their roles next year as they look to make an impact. For head coach Paul Stumpf, this season can be built upon for next year where the ""òChos will look to compete for the Big West title once again.†

This is the first time all season that UCSB has lost two straight games. Cal Poly dominated the match, winning each set by at least six points and at most 12. The Mustangs were on fire with a .391 hitting percentage whilst holding the Gauchos to a measly .139. Lindsey Ruddins hit just .050 for six kills while Tallulah Froley led the team with nine. Mustang Maia Dvoracek had herself another solid but unspectacular night, hitting for a game-leading 13 kills and adding eight digs. It was senior outside hitter Jessica McRoskey's performance that shined the brightest, however, as she cruised to 11 kills thanks to a phenomenal .714 kill percentage while also committing just a single error. The Mustangs did more than just finish though as they ended the night with significant advantages over the Gauchos in service aces (6-0), blocks (3-1) and digs (34-28). It wasn't just Dvoracek and McRoskey that provided the firepower either, as five Mustangs finished the night with at least six kills, as opposed to the Gauchos' two.† In all honesty, there wasn't a whole lot of bright spots for UCSB as Cal Poly was seemingly a step ahead of them in every facet of the game.† One could argue that Olivia Lovenberg and Romoni Vivao, who posted 13 and 10 assists respectively, showed up and played their parts, but the fact of the matter is that the performance put on at the Mott Athletics Center is just unacceptable for a team vying for championship glory. It was two weeks ago when I argued UC Riverside would pose the bigger threat to UCSB as they were preparing for a two-game road trip against both UC Davis and Riverside, because there's something different about playing the spectrum ends when you're smack-dab in the middle of attempting to claim the elusive title of elite.† You see, the Gauchos were 17-2 coming off of two games in which they saw their 13-game win streak shut down at the hands of Hawai'i, only to then vigorously stampede the Mustangs to a 3-1 victory that surely made every Gaucho fan think, ""úThis is the year.""ù† Because when you're an elite team, you don't go home sulking over a lost win streak. You go home and learn. You learn from the performance, and you get right back to training. The schedule now reads UC Davis and UC Riverside with just a day in between. Davis was 3-5 in their previous eight games, including a loss to UCSB, and was looking to continue their push for respect, considering there was and is a significant gap between them and the Cerberus that is Hawai'i, Cal Poly and UCSB.† Now, while Davis must have been looking to taste that sweet revenge, there's nothing more revealing of a top team than a loss to the bottom feeders. Being elite means there can't be losses to last-place teams, and that there must be wins not against other top teams, but in big games.† Back-to-back sweeps that weekend didn't reveal much, but the Gauchos did what they were supposed to do. A 3-1 win over Long Beach State meant the Gauchos were rolling again at the right time with Hawai'i and Cal Poly next on the calendar yet again.† Two big games. In fact, considering the hit UCSB's championship hopes would take in the event of just a single loss, these were two very big games.† And they were two very bad losses. A solid performance at Hawai'i was capped by an absolute collapse of a final set that allowed the Rainbow Wahine to move into first place, while Mustang Madness was clearly scheduled at the Mott. The Gauchos now find themselves at third place with just four games left.† UCSB will need to win out if they are to keep their hopes of glory alive. Time will tell who these Gauchos really are, but for now, we will have to steer clear of that elusive elite.† UCSB will hit the road for back-to-back matches against both Long Beach State and CSUN this weekend.†

On Sunday evening, the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team followed the blueprint a little too closely. Just like the Beach before them, the Gauchos took a lead into halftime against UCLA only to watch the Bruins roar back to life in the second half. UCSB made several comeback attempts, but ultimately fell short and lost 77-61. The loss dropped the Gauchos to 1-1 on the season, and pushed UCLA to 2-0 under new head coach Mick Cronin. Both teams got off to a slow start on Sunday, combining for 8 total points in the first six minutes, but 9 points and 4 assists from senior guard Max Heidegger helped the Gauchos get their offense going. Sophomore forward Jay Nagle and graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman both chipped in 6 points on 2 threes as well, and helped push UCSB out to a lead. The Gauchos were never able to widen their lead much, however. Nagle's second three gave UCSB a 29-23 advantage with just under four minutes to go in the first, but UCLA hung tight and went into halftime down just 34-32. UCSB's inability to build a significant cushion in the first half doomed them in the second half. Just as Long Beach State learned a few nights earlier, it takes a lot of cushion to topple a team like UCLA. The 2-point cushion, such that it was, lasted the Gauchos just under a minute of second half action. Two UCSB turnovers and two Prince Ali buckets reversed the situation and put UCLA up 36-34 with 19:14 left in the game.† The Gauchos never regained the lead. The Bruins built up an 11-point lead over the following five minutes, largely off the strength of their size and rebounding. UCSB was staring down something of a size disparity from the get-go, but the team managed to keep pace with the Bruins' big men on the glass in the first half. That changed completely in the second half. In the final 20 minutes of action, UCLA grabbed 21 rebounds to UCSB's 10. Included in UCLA's 21 boards were ten offensive rebounds, many of which quickly became second-chance points. The Bruins dominated that category all game with 20 against just 5 for the Gauchos. Many of those second-chance buckets came in the second half, and enabled the Bruins to take control of the game and coast to victory. Redshirt sophomore center Jalen Hill did the most damage with 22 points and 10 rebounds, 8 of which came on the offensive glass. UCSB's big men couldn't contain Hill and his teammates, and couldn't stay out of foul trouble, either. Sophomore forward Amadou Sow and junior forward Robinson Idehen both fouled out in the second half, and Freeman finished with 4 fouls. The fouls aside, Freeman turned in a solid performance in his second game in a UCSB jersey. A transfer from Oklahoma, Freeman knocked down 3 three's and finished with 12 points, second only to Heidegger. Heidegger provided almost half of the Gauchos' second half offense with 12 points, and finished with 21 on the evening. The senior dished out a team-high 6 assists against only 2 turnovers as well. UCLA might have taken swift control of the game in the second half, but the Gauchos didn't go down without a fight. They put up several fights, in fact, the last of which saw the lead cut to eight on a Heidegger layup with 4:44 to go. Just as they had done to each comeback attempt before it, however, the Bruins stifled this last gasp with rebounding and post offense. Hill corralled an offensive rebound and put it back up to make the game 67-57, and followed that up with a dunk on the next possession. The lead never again dipped below double-digits. Hill did the most damage of any Bruin, but he had plenty of help. Sophomore guard Jules Bernard was a dynamo off the bench with 20 points and 8 rebounds, while guards Ali and Chris Smith had 12 and 13 points, respectively. UCSB's job doesn't get too much easier next week. The Gauchos host Rice on Saturday before traveling to Corvallis to take on Oregon State, another Pac-12 opponent, next Wednesday. Size will likely be an issue again against the Beavers, but UCSB proved on Sunday they can hang with marquee competition. The trick next time is hanging with them for two whole halves of basketball.

Perhaps this would be due in part to the help behind Ruddins, but Long Beach has clear advantages over UCSB with higher numbers in both assists (1194-1096) and digs (1337-1261).† Both teams also have four players with at least 100 kills, with the top count going to Williams, but the low count also goes to Long Beach's Allison Martinez, who has 103.† I decided to take an even deeper look into these offenses and quickly calculated the hitting percentages of each team's leading four scorers, finding that Long Beach's Williams, YiZhi Xue, Katie Kennedy and Martinez have shot for a combined .252; all the while, UCSB's Ruddins, Tallulah Froley, Rowan Ennis and Deni Wilson have completely eclipsed that number at .308.† It is also interesting to note that Ruddins is the only one of her team's top four scorers to have shot under .300 thus far, while Xue would be the only member of her team's top four to shoot for over .300. Long Beach's Kennedy takes the spot for the most inefficient of the combined eight at .155. Taking into account the fact that Long Beach is playing for respect and the Gauchos are still seeking silverware, it'll be a hard-fought match with the Gauchos likely taking the win.† Players to look out for include all of the aforementioned as each offense is set to have a stout cast of warriors around them capable of fighting from start to finish.† CSUN will pose the bigger threat this weekend given their extraordinary form as of late. It should also be mentioned that CSUN's last three games are against Cal Poly, UCSB and Hawai'i, in that order.† What a tough fight to end the season for all remaining teams, but it's a given at this point that the Matadors would love nothing more than to add a little drama to this soap opera that is the Big West.† CSUN is led by Seyvion Waggoner who leads her team with 311 kills, but at just a .235 rate.† Other notable stat advantages include errors, in which UCSB leads at 429-474, and service aces, in which CSUN leads at 129-104. This means the Matadors are flinging fire at 5.16 free points per game.† It is obvious that the Matadors have been nothing short of devastating on the serve. The Gauchos will have to be focused if they are to defend CSUN's masterful service game.† As far as the Gauchos are concerned, Olivia Lovenberg will likely be Olivia Lovenberg, Deni Wilson will surely be looking to finish her freshman year strong and Ruddins will have to be ready to roll if UCSB is to have any hope at hopping Hawai'i or Cal Poly.† Other players to watch include UCSB's Froley and Romoni Vivao and CSUN's Waggoner, Kamalu Makekau-Whittaker (455 assists) and Makayla Bradford (355 digs).† UCSB will visit the infamous Walter Pyramid this Friday, where they will take on Long Beach State, before heading to Northridge on Saturday. Both games will kick off at 7 p.m.

sports,Gauchos Return to the Thunderdome for Two-Game Homestand,14-Nov-19,5:32 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-14/gauchos-return-to-the-thunderdome-for-two-game-homestand/,"Nexus File Photo The UCSB women's basketball team returns to the Thunderdome this week for a two-game homestand. The Gauchos will be taking on the San Jose State Spartans on Friday and then hosting the USC Trojans on Monday. UCSB comes into the weekend with a 1-1 record, fresh off the heels of a 64-43 loss against St. Marys on Friday.† Freshman point guard Johnni Gonzalez was the only Gaucho that reached double figures in the loss, which was the silver lining in an all-around disappointing performance. The ""òChos finished with shooting splits of 26.5/13/57.1 and actually had more turnovers (10) than assists (9).† This was a complete switch-up from the season opener where UCSB defeated Utah Valley 59-51. In that game, junior guard Danae Miller shot a perfect 5-of-5 from the 3-point line en route to a game-high 24 points. Freshman center Ila Lane also dropped in 15 points to go along with 6 rebounds in her freshman debut. The question is: Which team will show up this weekend? San Jose State University (SJSU) gives the Gauchos a great opportunity to get their offense back on track. The Spartans have given up around 82.75 points per game, and opponents have shot 43% from the field against them.† The key to victory for UCSB will be taking advantage of SJSU's lack of a strong interior presence. San Jose is losing the cumulative rebounding battle 129-104 over its first three games. Although the Gauchos are missing one of their best centers in Natalia Bruening, this will be a great opportunity for Ila Lane to continue to establish her presence in the paint. SJSU mainly runs a two-woman operation on offense, with the point guard-forward duo of Ayzhiana Basallo and Tyra Whitehead doing the bulk of the scoring. They currently are averaging a team-leading 21.3 and 17.3 points respectively. Danae Miller will most likely be tasked with stopping Basallo, who does most of her work on the perimeter, while it will take a team effort to slow down Whitehead in the post. If the Gauchos are able to slow these two down, they should be in perfect position to pick up their second win of the season. Looking ahead to Monday's matchup, UCSB will have its work cut out when the undefeated Trojans come to town. USC offers up a completely different challenge than the Spartans as they feature an extremely stingy defense, only giving up an average of 51 points per game so far. The Trojans haven't shot well at all from the field; however, they have dominated their opponents on the board, producing second-chance opportunities that help offset their poor shooting.† One glaring weakness that the Gauchos will have to take advantage of is USC's propensity to turn the ball over. The Trojans are averaging a whopping 16 turnovers per game, and it will be crucial for UCSB to force errors and earn fast-break opportunities because of how difficult it is to score when USC has its half-court defense set. The Trojans have an extremely balanced offense composed of three double-digit scorers. Instead of prioritizing individual defense and matchups, the Gauchos will have to communicate and defend as a unit in order to get stops on Monday. The pivotal storyline for UCSB this weekend will be how Danae Miller responds after an uncanny poor shooting night in her last game. With the emergence of Johnni Gonzalez as the main distributor on the floor, Miller has been given more freedom to produce and take shots. If she is able to get back on track, then the Gauchos have a great chance to win at least one of their two games coming up. UCSB faces off against SJSU at 7 p.m. on Friday and plays USC at 7 p.m. on Monday. Both games will take place at home in the Thunderdome.

The conference's top two teams will face off as No. 15 UCSB travels up north to UC Davis for the Big West Tournament Finals. Along with the championship, much will be at stake as a spot in the NCAA Tournament will also be up for grabs.† On the season, UCSB holds a 12-3-4 overall record and are 4-1-2 in conference play. Currently on a two-game unbeaten streak, the Gauchos have slowly started to pick up their form now in the postseason. Considering that Friday's title match will be away at UC Davis, it's also worth noting that UCSB continues to be undefeated when on the road.† Heading into this one, the Gauchos will be coming off a dominant 2-0 home victory over CSUN in the Big West Tournament Semifinals.† As for UC Davis, their season stands at an overall record of 12-4-2 and 5-1-1 in the Big West. After a slow start to their season, the team has truly turned it around and will give the Gauchos their toughest challenge yet as they are also undefeated in playing at home.† The Aggies also earned a 2-0 home victory of their own in the semifinals against Cal State Fullerton, and there will be no rested advantage for either the Aggies or the Gauchos as both teams finished the conference regular season as the top-two seeded teams, thus granting them each first-round byes.† Historically, UCSB is favored in this matchup, as the Gauchos lead in the all-time record versus the Aggies by a record of 23-10-6. However, these two sides have met only once before this season, back in late October, and that encounter resulted in a 1-1 draw after double overtime. In addition, the Gauchos were also missing a few key players that day due to several sustained injuries.† Following the announcement of the yearly Big West honors, a total of eight Gauchos were named for the all-conference team, including Noah Billingsley for Defensive Player of the Year, Thibault Candia for Co-Midfielder of the Year and Finn Ballard McBride for Freshman of the Year.† But in terms of whom to watch for among the Gauchos at Friday's championship game, junior forward Rodney Michael and senior forward Will Baynham are the players in form. As it stands, both members of the dynamic duo lead their team in playmaking with 8 assists apiece. They've also managed to get their names on the scoresheet quite frequently as Bayham has the second-most goals for the Gauchos with 7, and Michael comes in fourth with 5 goals to his name. Of the striking duo, each notched a goal for UCSB in their semifinal bout versus CSUN, and each will surely play a pivotal role in the final title match as well.† For the Aggies, they have a star striker of their own in senior forward Adam Mickelson. After scoring the second goal for his side's semifinal match against Cal State Fullerton, Mickelson now has 4 goals on the season to go along with his team-leading 5 assists. As Mickelson is also leading his team in total shots, it'll be vital for the Gauchos to keep UC Davis' main offensive target from getting hot.† With plenty of storylines in the mix and plenty of star players to compete this week, the Big West Tournament Final is shaping up to be yet another great day for soccer fans. Tune in as the men's soccer conference season concludes with what'll be a memorable bout between No. 15 UCSB and No. 16 UC Davis.† Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. this Friday, Nov. 15, as the Gauchos travel away to take on the Aggies at Aggie Soccer Field.†

These two water polo powerhouses have a history of playing close, physical games with one another, and I expect Saturday to be no exception. Both of these teams want to enter the upcoming Golden Coast Conference (GCC) tournament with a high seed and unbreakable momentum. Therefore, Saturday's contest should be a good one.† The Gauchos currently own a 19-5 overall, 3-1 conference record that puts them in second place in the conference standings. Pepperdine has earned a 21-7 overall, 3-1 conference record but sits just below the ""òChos in the GCC standings due to losses in the three previous games between these two teams. UCSB comes into this match as winners of their last four games and have been playing like a serious title contending team. Over these games their astounding depth and senior leadership has been on display. Senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic has been dominant for the Gauchos averaging an impressive 3 goals a contest over the past four games. Along with Gvozdanovic, attackers like sophomore Nathan Puentes have been shooting very effectively. Last week, Puentes had a career night versus No. 7 Cal, ripping off a remarkable 6 goals.† Pepperdine also comes in as winners of their last four games. The team's last game was an impressive 10-9 victory over No. 8 Long Beach State. Pepperdine is led by senior center and 2-meter man Chris Dilworth who had 3 goals against Long Beach. If UCSB wants to beat Pepperdine on Thursday, they are going to need shut him down through their stout zone defense and make him swim by controlling the tempo of the game. If they continue to play as a cohesive unit, as they have over the past four games, the Gauchos can be a dangerous force entering this weekend's match and the GCC tournament.† The game is in Malibu this Saturday at noon.

Nexus File Photo UC Santa Barbara men's basketball Head Coach Joe Pasternak wants free throws to be an integral part of his team's identity. So far this season, that's only been occasionally true. UCSB is 1-1at this point in the season, with 22 free throw attempts in a win over Jackson State and 9 free throw attempts in a loss to UCLA. When the Gauchos host Rice University on Saturday afternoon, they'll be aiming for a number closer to 22. If the Gauchos need any more evidence that free throws are important, they need not look any further than the last time they played Rice. UCSB topped the Owls 99-89 in an overtime thriller last season thanks in large part to 23 free throws made on 24 attempts, a far cry from this season's UCLA game.  The Owls are 3-1 this season with wins over Penn, Wayland Baptist and Northwestern State and a 91-43 loss at the hands of Arkansas. Penn beat Alabama in Tuscaloosa earlier this season, adding a little extra luster to Rice's victory. Rice returns with three starters from last year's team, but sophomore guard Trey Murphy III, new to the starting lineup this year, has been the team's most impactful player so far this season. Murphy leads the Owls with 14.5 points per game on 45% field goal shooting and 33% shooting from beyond the arc. The sophomore has increased his point total in every game so far this season, including most recently with a 25-point performance against Northwestern State. ""úTrey Murphy is a great player,""ù UCSB head Head Coach Pasternack said. ""úHe can really shoot the ball. He's a three-man playing the four-man, he can drive, he can shoot the ball, they iso him a lot and our four men are gonna have to do a great job defending him.""ù Senior guard Ako Adams is second on the team in scoring with 11 points per game so far this season. Setting aside a game against Wayland Baptist that saw Adams play just 10 minutes and score zero points, the senior is averaging 14.7 points.† Adams, who has started every game for the Owls since his sophomore year, is one of four seniors on the team. Fellow senior Robert Martin, a forward, is the only other senior in the starting lineup and provides some experience in the frontcourt. Martin is averaging 5.3 rebounds a game so far this season, second only to 6-8 sophomore wing Drew Peterson and his 7.3 rebounds a game. Keeping both Martin and Peterson off the glass is a must for the Gauchos, who lost the rebounding battle, and subsequently, the war on Sunday against UCLA. Rice has turned the ball over 16.8 times per game so far this season, third-worst in the Conference USA. That number is inflated by a nightmare performance against Arkansas that saw the Owls turn the ball over 27 times, but the point remains that Rice has struggled with ball security. The Gauchos, meanwhile, have struggled to force turnovers in their two games this season, setting up an interesting clash on Saturday. Against UCSB, Jackson State and UCLA both turned the ball over 9 times, which would make for Rice's most ball-secure game this season. ""úWhat we have to do is play 40 minutes of defense,""ù Pasternack said. ""úAgainst Jackson State we only played a half, ""¶ and against UCLA we only played in the first half defensively.""ù While the Owls haven't excelled at taking care of the basketball, they've done at least a so-so job of keeping opponents away from the free throw line. While Northwestern State did achieve† 24 chances from the charity stripe during their matchup, no other team has cracked 15 free throw attempts this season. In order to follow in Northwestern State's footsteps, the Gauchos will have to play aggressively on offense and focus on getting to the rim rather than settling for jumpshots. Rice presents much less of a size disadvantage for UCSB than UCLA does, which should make interior offense a little easier to come by. ""úWe need to be more aggressive offensively, attacking the basket, driving the ball, posting up and using our size to our advantage to get to the free throw line,""ù Pasternack said.† UCSB played Rice aggressively last season and got 24 free throws and a win out of it. The situation isn't exactly the same this season, but if the Gauchos follow a similar blueprint, they'll put themselves in a position to win again. UCSB hosts Rice University on Saturday in the Thunderdome at 2 p.m.

The Gauchos were not able to get their offense going against a stout Aggie defense, and two second-half goals dashed any hopes of the team's first Big West title since 2010. Backed by a raucous home crowd, UC Davis dominated the pitch from the opening kick.† Although the Aggies' calling card has been defense all season long, the top team in the Big West was on the attack early in this game. Davis got in six shots before the Gauchos could even muster up one, and ended the half up 8-1 in total shots.† This was a huge departure from the last few games that UCSB has played. The Gauchos hadn't given up a goal in over 342 minutes prior to this matchup, and had done a great job of possessing the ball and limiting opportunities for their opponents. Whether it was the unusual 2 p.m. start time or simply fatigue, UCSB definitely looked sluggish and slow to the ball in the first half. One of the silver linings in this game was the goalkeeping ability of sophomore Ben Roach, who kept Santa Barbara in the game until the very end. He made a whopping six saves in the game, including three crucial saves to keep the game even heading into the second half. One of the hallmarks of this season for the Gauchos has been strong play in the second half, yet they didn't come out of the gates after halftime with the energy they had shown in their last few games. Davis got a couple quick shots off to start the half, and in the 55th minute were able to turn an errant UCSB pass into a fast break opportunity. Aggie sophomore forward Robert Mejia took the ball down the left wing and sent a through ball between two Gaucho defenders to a streaking Andy Velasquez, who was able to hold off a UCSB defender with his arm before sliding the ball between Roach and the goalpost, giving Davis a 1-0 lead. UCSB was able to get a little momentum going later on in the period, culminating with a Thibault Candia shot in the 71st minute that went just wide of the goal, but again Davis dominated on offense, ending the game with a 18-4 advantage in shots taken. The Gauchos launched a last-ditch effort at the end of the game to try to create a goal-scoring opportunity in the 89th minute, bringing up Roach for a corner kick. The Aggies were able to clear the ball and counterattack however, and with just 15 seconds to go forward Kristian Heptner blasted the ball into the vacant net to put Davis up 2-0. With the defeat, UCSB has now lost the opportunity to automatically qualify for the NCAA D1 Tournament. The Gauchos will have to hope that their strong performances in the regular season bolstered them to the position of being selected for the tournament. They find out if they were selected and who their opponent is during the NCAA Selection Show on Monday at 10 a.m.

The Gauchos collapsed in the final 12 minutes, scoring just 17 points to the Owls' 40. Sophomore guard Payton Moore capped off the comeback with a last-second layup to give the Owls their first lead since 11:10 in the first half and a stunning 82-81 victory. ""úAll we talked about all week was 10 four-minute wars,""ù UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said after the game. ""úThat was all we talked about at halftime. These are young kids, and unfortunately, it's human nature to look at the scoreboard.""ù The loss dropped UCSB to 1-2 this season and pushed Rice to 4-1.† It's hard to imagine how the first half could have gone any better for the Gauchos, which made the second half all the more shocking. UCSB shot almost 62% from the field and raced into the locker room at halftime with a 47-27 lead. Almost all of the Gauchos' first-half production came from inside the paint. Senior guard Max Heidegger repeatedly beat his man off the dribble and finished through contact on the rim, while sophomore forward Amadou Sow and junior forward Robinson Idehen overpowered their defenders down low. Heidegger finished with a team-high 21 points, while Sow was close behind with 19 points and 7 rebounds. On the other side of the court, the UCSB defense made open shots scarce for Rice. Sophomore guard Trey Murphy III knocked down a few 3-pointers early on, and the Owls jumped out to a lead in the first few minutes; however, the visitors shot just 32.1% from the field in the first half and rapidly fell behind. However, that Gaucho defense was wholly absent in the second half. Both teams scored at a steady clip to open up the final 20 minutes, and the Gauchos even managed to extend their lead to 22 points a couple of times, but only Rice managed to keep their initial pace up.† The Owls missed only 6 shots in the second half, but they were particularly unstoppable in the last 10 minutes. The visitors ripped off a 28-9 run to tie the game at 78-apiece, and it was clear that UCSB had no response defensively. ""úDefensively, we got really exposed,""ù Pasternack said. ""úSame thing with UCLA, we can't play two halves of defense.""ù Rice scored more or less anyway they wanted in the second half. Murphy hit a couple more 3-pointers, and it seemed as though there was an open Owl either cutting or dribbling to the hoop on each and every possession. The Gauchos, on the other hand, were reminiscent of a battered boxer praying to be saved by the bell ""î or in this case, the final buzzer. Sow and graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman provided almost all of the team's offense in the final 10 minutes, but it wasn't enough to keep the Owls from landing the knockout blow. Freeman scored 11 points in the second half and finished with 15 points, 5 rebounds and 7 assists. It was the graduate transfer's best game as a Gaucho so far, and his 2 steals in the first half set up some of the early offense. Rice's senior forward Robert Martin got open inside and converted a layup with 3:16 to go that cut the lead to 76-74, but Sow responded with a strong finish through contact on the other end. The sophomore Gaucho drew a foul on the contact but missed the free throw, keeping the score at 78-74. A Moore layup and 2 free throws from sophomore guard Chris Mullins tied the game up at 78 and sent the large contingent of traveling Rice fans into a frenzy. Freeman coolly responded with a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 1:10 remaining, but that was the only counterpunch the Gauchos had in them. After a Rice timeout, Mullins came back on the other end and converted another layup with 41 seconds to go. UCSB milked the clock a bit on the next possession, but Heidegger's missed fadeaway off the side of the backboard returned the ball to the Owls with nine seconds to go. The Owls raced down the court, and Moore got inside once again for a layup with just four seconds on the clock. Pasternack had used his last timeout with around six minutes left in the half, forcing junior guard Devearl Ramsey to collect the inbounds pass and race down the court before hoisting a half-court attempt that fell to the right of the hoop. ""úI was trying to regroup our guys defensively [by calling the last timeout],""ù Pasternack said. ""úI could see it slipping away. Probably needed it at the end, but I wanted to slow their run down and not wait. Obviously, the timeouts didn't work.""ù Moore was integral to the Owls' comeback with 17 points in the second half after scoring just 1 point in the first 20 minutes of the game. Saturday's performance was the sophomore's best of the season and seemed to take the Gauchos by surprise. ""úThere was no game plan to stop Payton Moore,""ù Pasternack said. ""úWe do what we do, and in the second half, he just punked us.""ù The Gauchos will now have to regroup and get ready to take on Oregon State on the road on Wednesday night. The Beavers are at 3-1 this season with wins over Cal State Northridge, Iowa State and Wyoming and a loss at the hands of Oklahoma. Senior forward Tres Tinkle leads Oregon State so far this season in the three main offensive statistics with 21.5 points, 10 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. Tinkle is shooting 45% from 3 and at 6'7'' will present a difficult task for the Gauchos with his combination of range and rebounding. As a team, the Beavers are shooting just over 42% from 3-point land this season. That makes them the best shooting team UCSB has played so far this season, which could be an issue for the Gauchos given that Rice just shot 13-25 from the 3-point line on Saturday.

Menlo is 4-1 this season after losing 73-70 to Cal Maritime on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Gauchos are 1-3 after falling 78-67 to Oregon State on Wednesday night. UCSB never led and trailed by as much as 19 points in the second half but hung tight throughout the first half.† Facing off against a high-level defense, the Gauchos couldn't buy a bucket for much of the game. UCSB shot just under 37% from the field and went 5-27 on 3-pointers. Sophomore forward Amadou Sow led the Gauchos in points and rebounds with 14 and 11, respectively, while graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman was 6-9 from the field for 13 points. The Gauchos had no answer, however, for Beaver forward Tres Tinkle, who scored 27 points, pulled down 11 rebounds and went to the free throw line a game-high 9 times. Oregon State, as a whole, found offense much easier to come by than UCSB did and shot 56.6% from the field despite going 4-15 from beyond the 3-point line. UCSB gets a few days to move on from Oregon State and turn its attention towards Menlo. The Oaks represent something of a reprieve for the Gauchos, at least on paper, and UCSB will likely be the toughest team Menlo plays all season. The Oaks are not a particularly tall team, something the Gauchos will look to exploit on Saturday. Menlo's tallest player who plays significant minutes is 6'7""ù freshman forward Jake Tranter and 6'6""ù sophomore forward Corey Le'aupepe leads the team with 6.6 rebounds per game. UCSB boasts three significant contributors taller than Tranter: 6'9""ùsophomore forward Sow, 6'10""ù junior forward Robinson Idehen and 6'10""ù graduate transfer forward Freeman. While Freeman is more of an outside threat, Sow and Idehen will both have the opportunity to use their size to their advantage. Menlo relies heavily on 3-pointers, with distance shots making up about 40% of their overall field goal attempts. The Oaks are shooting 41.8% on those 3-point attempts and will likely rely on their shooting to attempt the upset. Menlo might be onto something with that strategy against UCSB. The Gauchos are shooting 31.8% from beyond the arc, but their opponents are bombing away at a 40.3% clip. Through four games, the Gauchos have proven vulnerable to the 3-point shot. That's music to the Oaks' ears and something Head Coach Joe Pasternack will likely focus on going into Saturday's game. Four different Menlo players ""î sophomore guard Ross Williams, senior guard Jeremiah Testa, junior guard N'Jai LeBlanc and junior guard Curtis Witt ""î have taken at least ten 3-point attempts this season, and all have proven to be more than capable shooters. Rice University had a similar array of shooters and used them to break the UCSB defense down last weekend, a result Pasternack would like to avoid this time around. A significant chunk of Menlo's successful start to the season came without one of its best and most experienced players, senior forward John Paine. Paine missed the second and third games of the season and is still working his way back into the lineup, but he is already reasserting himself as a major offensive weapon for the Oaks with 13.3 points per game. Limiting Menlo's 3-point shooting will throw a wrench in the gears of the Oaks' offense and allow the Gauchos to focus much of their remaining attention on Paine. If UCSB fails to do so, they could be in for another rough afternoon in the Thunderdome. UCSB takes on Menlo on Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m. in the Thunderdome.

Fortunately, the Gauchos' postseason continues on with a home bout against Cal in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.† In their most recent game, the Gauchos conceded their first road loss in the entire season, resulting in an away record of 5-1-3.

With Thursday night's venue set to be Harder Stadium, it's also worth noting that the Blue and Gold hold a home record of 7-3-1 on the season.† As for the Golden Bears, Cal's season hasn't gone quite as well as they had wanted. Early on in the regular season, they were a ""úreceiving votes""ù side according to the national rankings. Since then, their form has dipped some, and the team has struggled to consistently find wins; they now stand at an overall record of 8-6-3. Nevertheless, they'll be coming off an impressive 1-0 win over previously No. 4 Stanford and will be hungry for a second opportunity to face UCSB.† Cal is favored historically here, with the Gauchos trailing in the all-time series by a record of 11-19-3. This is also reflected in the earlier outing between the two sides back in September, when the Golden Bears defeated the Gauchos by a score of 3-0. Much will be on the line come game time, but UCSB will have an added incentive in that the last time they beat Cal was way back in 2003 ""î a win here will end that drought and propel them into Sunday's second round of the NCAA Tournament.† Players to watch for among the Gauchos will be those who weren't present in the last encounter due to international duty and ineligibility but who will surely make their presence known on the field this week. First up is Big West Defensive Player of the Year and senior defender Noah Billingsley. Originally unable to play because of a call-up by his home country of New Zealand, Billingsley plays the stalwart role on the Gaucho defense; with 5 assists to his name, he'll act as an imposing force against the Golden Bear attackers.† Next, the Big West Freshman of the Year, forward Finn Ballard McBride. With a team-leading 9 goals to his name, as well as a pair of assists, McBride is an ever-present danger to opposing defenders whenever he gets the minutes he deserves.† Junior defender Hunter Ashworth (New Zealand call-up) and senior defender Faouzi Taieb (previously injured) will also be available this time around.† On Cal's end, their forward duo, sophomore Alonzo Del Mundo and junior Tommy Williamson, will be providing the goal threat. Del Mundo leads his side in playmaking with 9 assists, as well as 2 goals of his own. Meanwhile, Williamson is Cal's top scorer with 9 goals total on the season; it was Williamson's penalty-kick goal that earned the Golden Bears the 1-0 upset over Stanford.† Altogether, it's a make-or-break game for both teams this Thursday, as the NCAA Tournament is formatted as single elimination. The winner advances to the second round's opponent ""î Saint Mary's College ""î while the loser will see their season come to a close.† All the postseason action kicks off this Thursday, Nov. 21, as UCSB hosts Cal in Harder Stadium at 7 p.m.

The No. 6 Gauchos come in with the third seed in this stacked college water polo tournament. They match up against No. 15 UC Irvine in their opening round match. UCSB will have to play it smart in the opening rounds if they want to advance far in this tournament that includes many of the top teams in the country. The Gauchos have earned league-wide recognition themselves, with six UCSB players being named to GCC All-Conference teams, announced at the beginning of the week.  Senior utility Ivan Gvozdanovic and sophomore goalie Danny Roland earned All-GCC first-team honors, senior attacker Jacob Halle and sophomore driver Nathan Puentes were selected for the All-GCC second team, and freshman attacker Mason Chambliss made it onto the GCC All-Freshman team. Sophomore attacker Sam Nangle rounded out the list with an honorable mention. UCSB will hope to turn these individual accolades into team success this weekend, with a matchup against rival Pepperdine looming in the second round if the squad takes down Long Beach State. As the team prepares for a long weekend of games, I got the opportunity to sit down with junior attacker Spencer Wood to talk about the upcoming games. Here is what Wood had to say: Jesse Morrison, Daily Nexus: You guys are heading into the Gold Coast Conference tournament, how does the team feel going in? Spencer Wood: We're feelin' really good, we've been training really hard this week and past weeks preparing for the multiple games we are gonna have. Everyone's healthy, everyone's fired up and we're ready to win it all. DN: You guys played Irvine in your first game; you guys beat them in your final home game of the season. How does the team feel about playing them in the first round? SW: We feel great. They obviously aren't a team we can look past; we are gonna have to play well and stick to our fundamentals. But I think we are really ready to crush ""òem down, then move on to the semi-finals and finals. UCSB's opening round match with UC Irvine kicks off this Friday at 11 a.m. If you can't make it to Pepperdine to support your Gauchos, tune in to theFosh.net for live updates and stats.†

sports,UCSB Women's Volleyball Looking To End Season Strong,21-Nov-19,5:15 AM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-21/ucsb-womens-volleyball-looking-to-end-season-strong/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara women's volleyball team will look to finish strong against Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine after having dropped one of two this past weekend. Despite losing a crucial match to Long Beach State on Friday, UCSB saw a Saturday win over CSUN that marked Nicole Lantagne Welch's 100th career victory as head coach of the Gauchos. She's currently in her seventh season in charge after having spent the previous 12 at Miami.† UCSB will return home for their games against Fullerton and Irvine this Friday and Saturday after a less than favorable weekend that saw the Beach clean up their sand with a 3-0 sweep over the Gauchos.† It was a valiant effort from UCSB at the Walter Pyramid, but Long Beach's Carly Aigner-Swesey dished out 38 assists and Tia Chavira had 14 kills off a sparkling .375 hitting percentage to seal the deal.† Earlier last week was when I argued that Kashauna Williams, who leads the Beach with 419 kills, would have to be shut down if the Gauchos were to win this game. Well, they shut her down to say the least as she was held to 11 kills and a measly .069 hitting percentage, but that was evidently not enough as the depth of Long Beach shown through.† Chavira is seventh on her team in kills and simply dominated at the net on Friday. How'd it happen? Unsurprisingly given their track record this season, but surprisingly given the final score, UCSB led the game in digs 54-51. It was neither a huge lead nor did it really define the team's overall performance on the court, but it did reveal that perhaps the Gauchos are not as clinical as we thought.† The Gauchos were just a sniff better foundationally, keeping the ball alive consistently throughout the game. Where they failed was in connecting the last few dots, ultimately committing 8 more errors on their way to putting points on the board .† The aforementioned Aigner-Swesey and her 38 assists led the way for a 43-34 lead in the assist department. It was just too easy for Long Beach State to finish given her consistency in putting up perfect balls.† The Gauchos reacted well, however, making sure not to leave their own brooms at home this time and sweeping CSUN the very next day.† Tallulah Froley had 13 kills, Olivia Lovenberg plated 22 hotcakes, Zoe Fleck dug it out 19 times and the Gauchos made easy work of the CSUN Matadors in a 3-0 sweep at the Matadome. The win snaps a season-long, 3-game losing streak for UCSB, who have also now won their 20th game of the season for the first time since 2009's 22-win campaign.† Gaucho Rowan Ennis should be proud of her rebound performance in Northridge, having finished with 12 kills and a remarkable .526 hitting percentage after an abysmal Friday that saw her post a -.600 kill rate thanks to her lack of kills and 3 errors. UCSB out-hit CSUN in every set, finishing with a .248-.175 kill percentage advantage.† It was a back-and-forth affair with UCSB being mostly a step ahead. The Gauchos were able to see it through, piecing together one or two significant runs in each set in an effort to tighten their stronghold.† The Gauchos eventually finished the sweep with leads in digs (60-52), assists (46-32) and aces (3-1).† UCSB will play host for their last two remaining games this weekend. Cal State Fullerton comes to town Friday night while UC Irvine will make the drive on Saturday.† Fullerton is currently in seventh place in the Big West with a conference record of 4-10. They are 12-13 overall, but that serves to prove more about their shortcomings in the conference. The Big West seems to be too much for Fullerton this year around, as they were swept by the Gauchos at home earlier this season.† The Fullerton Titans are led by Julia Crawford and her 342 kills, but the offense just doesn't have the same firepower as UCSB's. Crawford has also only hit .208 this season, but on the bright side, she is only a freshman and she'll have plenty of opportunities to grow.† Gaucho Lindsey Ruddins only has about a single game's worth of a kill advantage at 368, but Froley has 259 in second-place, which is 97 more than that of the Titans' second-leading scorer Felicia Marshall.† At this point in the season, there's no reason to expect anything less than a Gaucho victory.† UC Irvine comes to town as losers of 13 of their last 15 games, including an 8-game losing streak that recently ended with their 3-1 win over UC Riverside.† Unfortunately for the Anteaters, who aren't vying for anything other than last place, they followed up that win with a 1-3 loss to UC Davis.† They are now set to finish the season off as the visitors to Cal Poly and UCSB.† UCSB swept Irvine 3-0 earlier this season with a 75-51 scoreline over three sets. That's one point off an entire set's worth of points.† Ruddins only shot for .161 that game, while Anteater Abby Marjama tied her for the game-high kills with 10.† The Gauchos found victory in the power of composure and foundation, finishing with advantages in errors (13-20), digs (46-38) and solo blocks (3-1). Those kinds of numbers, combined with Ruddins' poor night, led the Gauchos to win over the Anteaters and finish with more kills (44-25) and assists (40-22).† Expect much of the same, if not more, from Ruddins and co.† Fullerton will face everything the Thunderdome has to offer this Friday, while UC Irvine will be in town Saturday. Both matches will kick off at 7 p.m.†

sports,No. 23 Gauchos Take Down Golden Bears in First Round of NCAA Tourney,22-Nov-19,7:29 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-11-22/no-23-gauchos-take-down-golden-bears-in-first-round-of-ncaa-tourney/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The No. 23 UCSB Men's Soccer team defeated the California Golden Bears 3-1 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Gauchos will advance to the second round for the first time since 2015, where they will face off with the No. 12 Saint Mary's Gaels. UCSB came into this matchup fresh off the heels of a crushing loss to the No. 14 UC Davis Aggies in the Big West Tournament championship game. The Gauchos were handily defeated by the Aggies, lost an opportunity for a bye in the NCAA Tourney and missed a chance for a conference championship. As the old adage goes, however, great players have short memories. The Gauchos came out on Thursday night and played one of their best games of the season against a Cal squad that had defeated two top-five teams in the last couple weeks. From the opening kick, the team played aggressively on offense, combining long through balls in the air with short sequences of passes in the midfield to diversify their attack. UCSB controlled the midfield from the jump, and the tactical move by Coach Tim Vom Steeg of moving star forward Rodney Michael to the middle of the field played a huge role in opening up the offense. ""úWhat [Michael] does in the middle of the field, it's very difficult to match him up because he can go left, right or center,""ù Coach Vom Steeg explained after the game. ""úHe picked up a lot of balls off of Will [Baynham] up front which allowed us to get into the attack.""ù This tactic paid off almost immediately when in the 18th minute, midfielder Thibault Candia stole the ball around ten yards outside of the box. Candia split two Cal defenders and sent in a perfect through ball to Michael who had made a huge run from the middle of the field. The Sierra Leone native gathered the ball in the box and placed the ball just past the outstretched arms of the Cal goalkeeper Drake Callender to give the Gauchos a 1-0 lead. UCSB would continue to dominate possession throughout the first half, but the Golden Bears were not going to go down easy. With just under seven minutes to go in the first period, UCB was awarded a corner kick, and sophomore midfielder Taylor Davila curled the kick into the middle of the box. It took a deflection off a few players, including Gaucho goalkeeper Ben Roach, and ended up at the feet of Cal midfielder Christian Gomez who tapped the ball into the goal to tie the game up. The second half started up similarly to the first, with the Gauchos maintaining possession of the ball. The tension was palpable in the stands at Harder as the threat of overtime loomed in the background, but again, it was Rodney Michael who was in the right place at the right time to set up the game-winning goal. In the 64th minute, the ball was kicked back to Callender, but he whiffed on the clearance attempt and Michael pounced at the opportunity, collecting the ball and forcing Callender into a dangerous slide tackle in the box that yielded a yellow card and penalty for the Gauchos.† Candia stepped up to the penalty spot and cooly struck the ball into the bottom-right corner of the goal with the biggest shot of his career, giving UCSB the 2-1 lead. ""úYou have to be in the zone, not focused on what people are saying around you,""ù Candia said when asked about his process for taking the penalty kick. ""úMy team trusted me, and it was my duty to make the PK.""ù The Gauchos never looked back, and Baynham notched a goal in the 72nd minute off of a Noah Billingsley cross to officially put the game out of reach. A few spectacular Ben Roach saves later, the UCSB men's soccer team won their first NCAA tourney game in four years and set up a second-round matchup with the No. 12 Saint Mary's Gaels. The Gaels come into this game with a 17-1 overall, 7-0 conference record and have currently won nine games in a row. Their only loss this season was a 4-2 defeat at the hands of UC Davis; however, their strength of schedule really wasn't too high overall. If UCSB can come out and give the same effort that the team did on Thursday night, there's a great chance that the Gauchos could be advancing to the third round and could possibly host one more match at Harder Stadium. The second round of the NCAA Tournament kicks off on Sunday, Nov. 24 at 1 p.m..

The Gauchos handed the Gaels their second loss of the season and have outscored their opponents by a combined 7-1 in the first two games of the NCAA tourney. UCSB has now set up a date with perennial powerhouse No. 5 Indiana in the Sweet 16 next Sunday. On paper, St. Mary's had seemed to be one of the toughest matchups that the Gauchos would face in the tournament. The Gaels had an incredible 16-1 record before Sunday's game, had won 9 games in a row and hosted Sunday's game on an extremely narrow field that cut off a lot of space from the wings that the Gauchos usually utilize on offense. All this, combined with an abnormal 1 p.m. start time, meant that the Gauchos had a plethora of built-in excuses to use had they lost this match. They didn't need them. The Gauchos imposed their will on the game from the opening kick, taking advantage of their extreme size advantage to turn the match into a physical contest. Kiwi defenders Noah Billingsley and Hunter Ashworth were the engines for UCSB early on. The duo, who helped the New Zealand U-23 national team qualify for the Olympics just a couple of months ago, were everywhere on the field to help the Gauchos start the game off well. Billingsley tested the Gaels' defense with a rocket that was deflected in the fifth minute for the first shot of the match. Santa Barbara had a few more solid chances in the opening stages of the game, but as the first half wore on, it seemed as if UCSB couldn't quite get the touches that the team wanted in the box. In years past, the team would compensate for a lack of offensive firepower by relying on superb set-piece skills. One of the positives that Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg has harped on this season is how the Gauchos have been able to score in other ways; however, it was this old style of bully-ball that helped the team gain the lead on Sunday afternoon. In the 32nd minute, the Gauchos were awarded a free kick from around 10 yards outside of the box on the left wing. Senior Ignacio Tellechea stepped up and curled a high-arching ball into the back of the box which Ashworth headed down into the middle of the box. The ball took a huge bounce right in front of Billingsley who headed it home, giving the Gauchos a 1-0 lead. UCSB defended well for the rest of the half and went into halftime with their 1-goal lead intact.† It was all Santa Barbara in the second half, as 3 goals in around 15 minutes turned this game from a close contest to a rout pretty quickly.† The first of the 3 came in the 64th minute.† Midfielder Kaya Fabbretti collected the ball in the box after a botched clearance and sent a chipped pass over to forward Will Baynham, who blasted the ball into the upper-right corner of the goal to double the lead for the ""òChos. Just five minutes later, forward Rodney Michael initiated a one-man fast break on the right wing that culminated in his second goal of the NCAA Tournament after he blasted the ball just past the outstretched arms of St. Mary's keeper. And it was Michael again in the 79th minute who put the nail in the coffin with a brace, taking a stolen pass to the house to extend the lead to 4 for UCSB.This has been a historic postseason run for the Gauchos, marking their first time winning 3 games in the NCAA Tourney since 2009. UCSB has relished being in the underdog role so far, but their mettle will truly be put to the test next weekend against an outstanding Indiana team. At the moment, however, it's time yet again to celebrate an impressive win over a top team in the country. Knowing these Gauchos, this run isn't close to over yet.

Everyone played their role and played it well, so much so that not a single Gaucho had digs in the double-digit Instead, digs were well-distributed amongst the team as six players had more than 4 digs, and three had 6 digs or more.† Basically, the Titans had no time to react to a very efficient Gauchos team. Decisions were made instantaneously and UCSB found themselves on top almost the entire way.† The Gauchos had to take the lead in sets one and three after quick starts for Fullerton, but never gave them back. The middle set was a Gauchos game from start to finish. Highlights for Fullerton include junior right side Tyler Fezzey who shot .412 for 8 kills, junior setter Makenzi Abelman and her 23 assists and junior libero Savahna Costello, who was the only player in the game to reach 10 digs.† Ennis has been quietly consistent all season and Saturday's match against UCI was more of the same. Her .462 hitting percentage produced 7 kills while she also added 2 assists, 2 service aces, 5 digs and 4 total blocks.† Ruddins led both teams in kills with 15, but Anteater freshmen""îmiddle blocker Onye Ofoegbu and outside hitter Joy Umeh""îkept the pressure on with 12 and 10 kills, respectively. They shot a combined .508 and forced the Gauchos to be composed.† And composed they were, committing 3 less errors en route to a 3-0 sweep that included 23 ties and 5 lead changes.† The late wins just weren't enough as the Gauchos finished one game back of Cal Poly and two of Big West champions Hawai'i.† Losses to Hawai'i in each game and a loss at Cal Poly proved to be the most significant matches of the entire season. Victories in each of these games would have brought UCSB the real victory, the Big West Championship. Much of the talk this season focused on how different this Gauchos team was than in recent years, that this team had become composed clinicians ready to fight with strong leads or uphill battles. Unfortunately for head coach Nicole Lantagne Welch and her squad, the very first test had no margin for error. Coming home for a match against the Rainbow Wahine after having won their 13th straight game, Hawai'i made quick work of the Gauchos in a 3-0 sweep and holding Ruddins to just 12 kills off a .216 hitting percentage.† That just cannot happen to a team vying to stake their claim amongst the elite. They did, however, follow-up that heartbreaker with a 3-1 Blue-Green win against the Mustangs team that simply took the Gauchos too lightly.† Ruddins missed that game with an injury she sustained in training while Lovenberg and freshman setter Romoni Vivao dished out 40 assists to seal the deal on an absolutely masterful team win. Freshman right side Tallulah Froley filled in quite nicely, posting 16 kills off a .250 hitting percentage. In the end, as fair or unfair as one might argue, a few failed tests heavily outweighed the passed ones.† This team had plenty of bright spots to appreciate, but onwards is where the ship goes and Welch will need to prepare to set course without the help of the graduating seniors""îstar Ruddins, outside hitters Torre Glasker and Chloe Allen and middle blocker-right side Charlie Robinson.† They will be greatly missed, but the Welch Way is to carry on, and the aforementioned would love nothing more than for her to lead this team to the promised land.†

Through their now-extended season, the Gauchos boast an overall record of 14-4-4 on the season ""î a win percentage of .727. With the exception of their runner-up finish in the Big West Conference Final, the Blue and Gold have managed to fill up the November calendar with nothing but Ws and will look to keep their form going through the continuation of December's national competition.† As for Indiana, the Hoosiers squad are undefeated in eight straight and will have an extra game to rest over Santa Barbara, due to their bye in the NCAA Tournament's first round. On the season, Indiana has an overall record of 15-2-4, a win percentage of .810 and have so far managed to not drop a single game when playing at home. Keeping the Gauchos' away record of 6-1-3† in mind, this is yet again shaping up to be UCSB's greatest challenge of the year.† The Gauchos head into this one with the historical advantage as they were the 2-1 road victors the last time these two sides faced off, back in 2009. UCSB also leads in the all-time series with a combined record of 3-1-1.† We'll be featuring several Gauchos in the ones to watch, as senior defender Noah Billingsley and senior midfielder Thibault Candia have already made an impact with both players each notching a goal and assist in the NCAA Tournament. However, UCSB's forwards are the clearcut difference makers as junior Rodney Michael and senior Will Baynham are responsible for getting the Blue and Gold on the scoreboard. Michael, with three goals to his name, and Baynham, with two, have been crucial all season long for the Gauchos and will surely showcase their talents through the remainder of the NCAA Tournament.† On the Hoosiers' end, freshman midfielder Aidan Morris is the key playmaker as he set up another goal in Indiana's second round bout against Kentucky and leads his side with 8 assists on the season. But it is who Morris set up that is the real danger man for the Hoosiers: freshman forward Victor Bezerra, the team leader in goal scoring, scored a hat-trick last time out. Bezerra has 8 goals and 3 assists to his name this season and the Gauchos will surely pay special attention to this in-form striker.† Depending on the results from the round of 16, either UCSB or Indiana will face off against the winner of the Michigan and Wake Forest game in the quarterfinals.† With the holidays upon us and the best of NCAA's Division 1 battling it out, the month of December will be truly exciting for collegiate soccer fans as the top 16 remaining†programs will continue to fight for a chance to play in the College Cup in Cary, North Carolina.† UCSB visits Indiana this Sunday, Dec. 1, as the round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament kicks off at 9 a.m.

sports,UCSB Advances to Elite Eight in Double-Overtime Thriller,3-Dec-19,2:04 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-03/ucsb-advances-to-elite-eight-in-double-overtime-thriller/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB men's soccer team pulled off its greatest victory of the decade on Sunday morning, taking down the No. 5 Indiana Hoosiers in a double-overtime thriller to advance to the Elite Eight stage of the NCAA Tournament. In an intense battle of attrition between one of the hottest teams in the country and a traditional defensive powerhouse, the Gauchos were the ones who maintained their form and came out on top due to a Will Baynham goal in the 102nd minute. UCSB set the tone of the match early on with a physical style of play that seemed to throw the Hoosiers off their game.† The Gauchos picked up 3 fouls in the first 12 minutes and finished the half off with a 9-4 fouling advantage. This usually is not a great sign, but in this case, it helped disrupt any offensive momentum that Indiana tried to build, and the Hoosiers were only able to get off 3 shots in the first half. Neither side succeeded in producing any quality looks as the half wore on. A Baynham strike from outside of the box in the 42nd minute forced Indiana freshman goalkeeper Roman Celentano to make a diving save, but the two teams went into halftime tied at 0-0. The Hoosiers had won 38 straight home games up to this point, yet as snow started to pour down onto the field during the intermission, it still seemed as if UCSB had the upper hand in the matchup. The fact that a California team was not just shutting out Indiana in those frigid conditions but actually physically dominating what is typically one of the most hard-nosed programs in college soccer was a huge indication of just how disciplined and tough these Gauchos are. Indiana must've felt the same way at the half, as the Hoosiers came out with guns blazing to kick off the second period. Junior defender A.J. Palazzolo was one of the most active players on the field, making huge runs from the Hoosier backline to set up his teammates with crosses from the wing. Indiana more than doubled the number of shots they took in the first half with 8, and the team settled into a possession style of play that forced the Gauchos to spend most of their energy running around on defense. Both of sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach's saves came in the second half, and UCSB's backline held strong to push the game into overtime. The Hoosiers almost ended the game in the 98th minute when Palazzolo sent in a cross to a wide-open Joris Ahlinvi in the box, but the midfielder skied the shot over the net, keeping the Gauchos in the game. When the second overtime period rolled through, it seemed as if the game was destined to go to penalty kicks. Neither team was giving an inch or allowing the other squad any daylight to get off a shot. That all changed with one mistake. Around the 102nd minute, redshirt senior defender Jordan Kleyn was set to receive a pass near the outside of Indiana's box. Kleyn lost his footing, however, allowing the ball to roll past him and into the periphery of Baynham who was near the action. The Australian pounced on the ball and sent in a rocket into the upper-left corner of the goal, completing the largest upset of the tournament and sending the Gauchos into the Elite Eight for the first time since 2006. This win adds another page to the storybook postseason run of this UCSB team. The Gauchos are the only unseeded team left in the tournament and in fact are the only team outside of the Top-8 seeds to make it this far. Even if it all ends next round, this squad has already made its mark in the world of college soccer.

sports,Lock Down Defense Fuels UCSB's Four-Game Win Streak,4-Dec-19,6:43 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-04/lock-down-defense-fuels-ucsbs-four-game-win-streak/,"Photo courtesy of Becca Romo All season long, UCSB men's basketball Head Coach Joe Pasternack has been focused on his team's defense. That was especially true after an 88-69 victory over Menlo College on Nov. 23 that saw the Oaks shoot over 50% from the field. In the three games since that lackluster performance, however, the UCSB defense has come on strong. So strong, in fact, that the Gauchos have now won four games in a row thanks in large part to defensive performance, with the latest win a 64-60 road victory over Cal State Bakersfield on Tuesday night. The Roadrunners shot just 42.3% against the Gaucho defense and turned the ball over 11 times. Bakersfield became the third UCSB opponent in a row to shoot under 50% and shot just 25% from beyond the 3-point line, the worst mark of any Gaucho opponent this year. Only one Roadrunner scored in double digits and the Gauchos held redshirt junior forward Taze Moore, Bakersfield's leading scorer this season, to a season-worst 3 points. The defensive success enabled UCSB to overcome a 38.5% shooting night and 11 turnovers of its own. The Gauchos were especially cold in the second half, when the team went 8-25 from the field, but still managed to win the half 31-29. UCSB took a 33-31 lead into halftime and never trailed in the second half, but also never led comfortably. The Gauchos' biggest lead was a 56-50 advantage with a little over four minutes left; the Roadrunners trimmed this lead down to 56-54 less than a minute later. Two free throws from sophomore forward Amadou Sow pushed the lead to 59-54 at the 2:38 mark and seemed to put the Gauchos in a position to put the game away. UCSB got stuck at 0:59, however, and the Roadrunners clawed their way to within one with 30 seconds to go on a layup from junior guard Czar Perry. Perry was almost the Roadrunners' entire offense in crunch time, with eight of the team's final 10 points. The junior had a game-high 23 points on 8-10 shooting, making him the only player the Gauchos just couldn't stop. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin responded to Perry's layup by going 1-2 from the free throw line, which gave Bakersfield the chance to tie the game with another two-pointer. The Gauchos finally managed to stop Perry, however, forcing the junior into an offensive foul with two seconds left that effectively sealed the game for UCSB. Redshirt transfer forward Matt Freeman had one of his best games offensively as a Gaucho with a season-high 19 points and four three-pointers. Freeman is now shooting 50% on three-pointers this season, the best mark on the team. Freeman also knocked down all four of his free throw attempts in the last 10 seconds of Tuesday's game, which was instrumental in closing the Roadrunners out. Freeman went 7-8 from the line overall in the game, and his 87.5 percentage is also best on the team this season. The Gauchos head back out on the road for their next game, although a little further afield. UCSB will travel to Texas to take on UT Arlington on Saturday for a 12 p.m. PST matchup. Arlington has had a remarkably uneven season so far in 2019, at 4-5. The Mavericks won their first two games, lost their next three and have alternated wins and losses losses in the four games since. Two of Arlington's losses have come against ranked teams. The Mavericks got run out of the gym by then-No. 14 Oregon 77-47 in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, but followed that rout up with a heartbreaking 72-66 loss to then-No. 8 Gonzaga. It's unclear which Mavericks team will show up on Saturday, but Arlington will for sure try to win with their defense. The Mavericks have held six of their nine opponents under 70 points and opposing teams are shooting just 39.8% from the field. Arlington is nabbing 5.1 steals per game this year, with redshirt sophomore guard David Azore and senior guard Brian Warren leading the way with around one steal per game apiece. Azore and Warren have also been leading the Mavericks offense: Azore is averaging a team-best 12.6 points per game to go with 4.3 rebounds per game while Warren is scoring 11.6 points per game and handing out a team-high 4 assists per game. Six-foot-nine senior forward Jabari Narcis has pulled down 7 rebounds a game so far this season, and his 16 points were an integral part of Arlington's effort against Gonzaga. Sow stands the same height and gives up just five pounds to Narcis, which should make for an interesting matchup on Saturday. Arlington is not a special team offensively, which should give the Gaucho defense a chance to come up big again. With four wins and three strong defensive performances in a row, UCSB has the confidence and momentum to take the victory.

sports,NCAA Tourney Is the Perfect Showcase for UCSB Women's Volleyball,4-Dec-19,8:32 PM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-04/ncaa-tourney-is-the-perfect-showcase-for-ucsb-womens-volleyball/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara women's volleyball team will take on Texas State this Thursday in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Having been selected at large alongside 31 other schools by the Division I Women's Volleyball Committee, UCSB is one of 64 teams competing in the tournament.† For a program like UCSB, that must still have a sour mouth after their phenomenal 22-win season wasn't enough to taste glory in the Big West, their being selected to partake in this famous competition shows how far this squad has come under the direction of Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch and, perhaps, how far the conference has come.† Welch led the Gauchos to an 18-11 overall, 13-3 conference record in 2013, her first season at the helm. The performance earned UCSB their first Big West championship in eight years and their first NCAA postseason appearance since 2010.† The Gauchos then proceeded to finish with three sub-.500 overall records in the next four years, including an abysmal 3-13 conference record in 2015. Fortunately for Welch, the 2018 arrivals of then-freshmen Zoe Fleck, Tallulah Froley, Olivia Lovenberg and Gigi Ruddins were bolstering for the team, to say the least.† UCSB followed up 2017's 8-20 campaign with a 17-12 overall, 9-7 conference record showing in 2018, moving from 6th to 4th in the conference.† This year was another monumental step for the Gaucho program. Veterans and rookies alike were evidently itching to feast, steamrolling the competition as they charged to a 13-game win streak that started in September. Hawai'i was the culprit, viciously breaking UCSB's stronghold over the conference with a 3-0 sweep at the Thunderdome in October.† UCSB finished 2019 with a 22-5 overall, 12-4 conference record, concluding Welch's seventh season as a Gaucho.† Just one (more) loss to Hawai'i, one to Cal Poly and one to Long Beach State in the final 6 games of conference play was enough to hand the Gauchos bronze in the Big West in their first 20-win campaign since 2009 and their best since Welch's arrival.† While UCSB's overall record is the best it has been in a decade, it's perhaps even more telling that they coupled that with a 12-4 showing in the conference, a record one game worse than in their 2013 championship season.† The stats will do little to appease the squad, who I'd imagine are still mulling their most recent losses, but the stars are shining for a club that is obviously good enough to hang with the best.† The thing is, will they hang with the best or will they be the best?† The NCAA tournament is the perfect showcase for Welch and her squad to prove that they can beat the best.† Texas State enters the tournament as champions of the Sun Belt Conference, finishing with a 24-8 overall, 14-2 conference record.† This will be Texas State's 11th appearance in the competition and their third time qualifying since entering the Sun Belt in 2013.† With five straight wins, they are just rolling through teams right now.† There is more disparity in the Sun Belt, though, and when you look at a combined table of the Sun Belt and the Big West, you'll find that Hawai'i, Cal Poly and UCSB are all in the top 5 places.† UCSB will be looking to catch Texas State off guard, and nothing would be more significant than a quick first-set victory.† Texas State is led by senior outside hitter Cheyenne Huskey, who finished 2019 with 416 kills off a .245 clip. Gaucho senior outside hitter Lindsey Ruddins finished with 398 kills but did so at a .278 rate, good for 51 fewer errors.† As for the assistant chefs, Bobcat Emily DeWalt finished with an astonishing 1,158 helpers but was the only player on her squad to dish out more than 100. The Gauchos had three such players in Lovenberg, Romoni Vivao and Fleck, who finished with a combined 1,214.† In quite an opposite fashion, the Gauchos possess the peaks and valleys of the digs game with the superior playing of Fleck but fall short against Texas State with total digs of 1452-1637. Both are still good total numbers, though, and fans should expect a disciplined team effort.† The winner of this one will take on the winner of the No. 2 University of Texas at Austin versus University of Albany game that will occur on Thursday at 7 p.m.† UCSB will hit the road for Thursday's match against Texas State. Game kicks off at 2:30 p.m.†

With No. 4 Wake Forest up next, UCSB is only a win away from securing a spot at the Final Four in Cary, N.C. Currently in the midst of a three-game win streak, UCSB had to defeat a Cal side that previously bested them, No. 12 St. Mary's in the second round and most recently No. 5 Indiana in order to get where they are now.† With this Elite 8 matchup set to be on the road for UCSB, the 15-4-4 Gauchos will travel to Wake Forest with immense confidence knowing they've only dropped a single away game throughout the entire season. In addition, the team has only allowed a single goal this entire NCAA Tournament.† Meanwhile, 15-4-2 Wake Forest have only lost once at home this season and will look to thoroughly defend their home pitch come Saturday afternoon.† Although these two sides have only faced off twice in the past, this Gaucho squad has a shot at making history as a win here over the Demon Deacons would be a program first. Historically, Wake Forest is favored here as they lead in the all-time series by a record of 1-0-1. With their last encounter occuring back in 2008, which resulted in a staggering 6-2 loss for the Blue and Gold, UCSB will be hungry for yet another notch in the win column and a spot at the College Cup.† With this Saturday's quarterfinal quickly approaching, ones to watch for the Gauchos include stars from both ends of the field. First is the goalscorer whose double-overtime strike sent UCSB on to the next round: senior forward Will Baynham. Leading his side in total scoring and playmaking on the season, and having scored in each round of the competition so far, Baynham has tacked on a total of 10 goals and eight assists to his name. Next in the net for the Gauchos and acting as a proverbial wall for opposing attackers is sophomore goalkeeper Ben Roach. A consistent asset to his team, as well as a starter in each match this season, Roach has earned an impressive 12 total clean sheets. With the Gauchos looking for a third-straight shutout win, Baynham and Roach will be crucial in UCSB's aspirations, especially considering the fact that star center back Hunter Ashworth is suspended for this game due to receiving his eighth yellow card on the year.† For Wake Forest, the Demon Deacons' attack features two quality goalscorers in sophomore forward Kyle Holcomb and senior midfielder Bruno Lapa. With a combined 18 total goals for their team at nine apiece, both attackers managed to get on the scoresheet last time out. Holcomb and Lapa will be yet another playoff test for the ever-solid UCSB defense.† With the NCAA College Cup Semifinal set for next Friday, and the trophy match to be played that same Sunday, both Cary and Santa Barbara will be eagerly awaiting the outcome of this weekend's UCSB vs. Wake Forest matchup.† UCSB will be traveling to No. 4 Wake Forest this Saturday, Dec. 7, with the quarterfinal's kickoff scheduled for 2:00 p.m.

The 2-3 loss comes just a day after the heroics of Tallulah Froley and Lindsey Ruddins put the Gauchos on top of Texas State in the first round, a game that gave UCSB their first tournament win since 2004.† In that game, Froley scored a career-high 18 kills while Ruddins posted yet another double-double with 18 kills and 13 digs.† Olivia Lovenberg was Olivia Lovenberg and provided 30 assists while Zoe Fleck's 26-dig performance was the second-highest of her career.† ""úThe idea on defense is that every ball is yours,""ù Fleck said after the game. ""úI feel like I went into the match with a really, really good mindset. I know who my hitters are, I know what my responsibilities are and every single ball on this court is my ball and I'm going to support my hitters. I'm going to dig these balls so that our offense can [do its job]. It was really just all a mindset for everyone on this team.""ù UCSB proceeded to topple Texas State in digs 70-54, making for a much stronger foundation for the offense to work through.† Janell Fitzgerald of the Bobcats, who posted 12 kills at a .267 rate, was the only member of her team to score more than 10 kills. The Gauchos, meanwhile, had two such players in Froley and Ruddins and they combined for 36 kills and a .335 efficiency.† A seesaw first set eventually settled with both teams locked at 20-20 before the Gauchos would end it with a 5-1 run. Texas State garnered quite a bit of momentum and found themselves up 19-13 late in the second. A timeout by Head Coach Nicole Lantagne Welch halted the Bobcat offense, and another magical 12-2 run by the Gauchos won them the second set.† UCSB went on to win 3-1 (25-21, 25-21, 20-25, 25-14) and were now headed for the second round with a very tough Texas team standing in their way.† Holding a 2-1 lead after three sets, the Gauchos (23-6) became the first team to win two sets against Texas (23-3) at home this season, and it was the first time Texas lost a set at home in the NCAA Tournament since 2016. Texas broke the game of pong with a four-point run to take a 20-17 advantage late in the first. And with that extra margin for error, they would go on to take the opener 25-22.† The Gauchos settled in and found victory in each of the next two sets. ""úWe really handled the ball well and we ran it fast and we were really in sync with that,""ù Welch pointed out postgame. †The Longhorns hit just .242 in the third while the Gauchos cruised to a phenomenal .548 with 18 kills and just one error.† With a 2-1 lead over the No. 2 ranked team in the nation, UCSB was looking mightily tenacious and held a significant advantage in hitting percentage.† Despite possibly the best start any UCSB fan could have hoped for, Texas found a way to put together a comeback. The Longhorns shot an errorless .462 with 18 kills to take the fourth set after having only trailed 1-0 at the start. They would ultimately take the fifth set, and the match, with a 15-10 victory.† As one of the greatest players in UCSB history, Ruddins will end her career as the all-time leader in kills, points and attempts in the rally scoring era and second all-time in kills in program history.† ""úIt means so much to be a Gaucho, being here for the last five years, just seeing this program take such huge strides,""ù she said postgame. ""úFive years ago we were not at this point, and just to be able to see the progress and to be able to witness where this program is going is incredible and I hope that I impacted all of my teammates in a positive way.""ù It's always tough to say good-bye, but it is no secret that losing the greats hurts a different way. UCSB will also be sending thank you cards to Torre Glasker, Chloe Allen and Charlie Robinson.† Fortunately for the Gauchos, they have a bright future in store, safe in the hands of a young core in sophomores Fleck and Lovenberg and freshmen Froley, Romoni Vivao and Deni Wilson, whose performances revealed they are very much ahead of their time.† UCSB ends this season with the most wins, and its first NCAA tournament win, since 2004.† That's definitely something to be proud of.†

sports,UCSB Men's Soccer Falls Just Short of College Cup Berth,8-Dec-19,6:27 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2019-12-08/ucsb-mens-soccer-falls-just-short-of-college-cup-berth/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus The UCSB men's soccer team's storybook season came to a close on Saturday afternoon, as the Gauchos lost 1-0 to the No. 4 Wake Forest Demon Deacons in the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Tournament. Deacon senior midfielder Alistair Johnston scored the game-winning goal in the 44th minute, effectively putting an end to an incredible Gaucho run in the tournament that included a blowout victory over Cal and two shut-out wins over ranked opponents on the road. UCSB actually came out of the gates looking like the better team on Saturday. The Gauchos dominated possession from the opening kick, hunting an early goal that would help silence the sold-out crowd at Spry Stadium. ""úI thought if we could jump on them in the first half and play with the lead, that would be the recipe that we needed,""ù Head Coach Tim Vom Steeg pointed out postgame. Senior midfielder Thibault Candia almost gave the Gauchos this crucial early lead twice in the opening 20 minutes. In the 13th minute, Candia sent a rocket of a shot from outside the box that just missed to the right of the goal. Just eight minutes later, Candia, who is also the Big West Co-Midfielder of the Year, produced one of UCSB's best opportunities of the match when he snuck behind the Wake Forest backline and shot a low-driven ball that was saved by Deacon goalkeeper Andrew Pannenberg. ""úIf you told me that Thibault Candia's walking the ball in 12 yards out facing the keeper to go up 1-0, I'd take that nine out of 10 times,""ù Coach Vom Steeg said. ""úUnfortunately, tonight was that one time.""ù The Gauchos continued to be aggressive as the half wore on, and the Wake Forest defense seemed to be cracking under pressure. In the 40th minute, junior forward Derek Kryzda whipped a perfect cross into the box that found senior defender Noah Billingsley who headed it toward the goal. Unfortunately, Billingsley placed it right into the chest of Pannenberg who inadvertently made the save as the ball ricocheted off of him. It was just that kind of a night for UCSB.† The team continued to produce amazing opportunities all game long, but the ball just would not bounce their way. There's a huge element of risk in soccer that comes from producing multiple chances but not capitalizing on them, as the opposing team seems to always make you pay for your failed efforts no matter how badly they were playing before. And that's exactly what the Demon Deacons did. Just four minutes after Noah Billingsley's header on goal, Johnston stole the ball near the outside of UCSB's box.† He attempted to dribble through a couple of Gaucho defenders, with the ball deflecting off of UCSB senior defender Faouzi Taieb's leg and rolling right in front of the goal; Johnston easily tapped the ball into the back of the net to give Wake Forest a 1-0 lead just a minute away from the halftime break. Giving up goals just before the half had been an issue that had plagued UCSB all season long, but up until this point in the Tourney, the team had done a great job of ramping up the intensity at the end of halves. It took just one slight deflection to change that. To the Gauchos' credit, they did not give up and played a tremendous second half. There were a couple more chances to tie the game up as the half wore on; a 74th-minute cross from junior forward Rodney Michael was just inches away from a streaking Candia in the box, and senior forward Will Baynham had a chance at a 1v1 with the Deacon goalie with around eight minutes to go, but he just couldn't bring the ball down. The Demon Deacons stayed composed and organized as the clock counted down, however, and succeeded in earning† a College Cup Bid for the sixth time in program history. They will take on No. 1 Virginia in the Final Four to see who gets a shot at the NCAA Championship against the winner of No. 7 Stanford/ No. 3 Georgetown. This was the greatest season of UCSB men's soccer since that of the championship team of 2006.† These Gauchos were able to overcome extremely disappointing failures in the Big West Tournament these last couple years and shock the world with a deep run in the NCAA Tourney. This team beat interstate rival UC Berkeley 3-1 in the first round, traveled to No. 12 St. Mary's and handed the Gaels a demoralizing 4-0 loss in the second round and braved the snow to deal No. 5 Indiana their first home loss in 38 games in the third round. They were not favored to win in any of these matchups yet approached each game with the swagger and skill of a powerhouse team. Although they couldn't make it to the College Cup, this team will go down as one of the most exciting and courageous teams in UCSB history.

Nexus File Photo The UCSB men's basketball team entered Big West play on a five-game winning streak and with a full head of steam. That head of steam turned into a wire-to-wire 63-45 dismantling of Cal Poly on Wednesday night in a statement game for the Gauchos. UCSB's win pushed the team's record to 12-4 overall and 1-0 in the Big West, while Cal Poly fell to 3-12 overall and 0-1 in the conference. The UCSB defense wholly stifled the Mustangs in their strongest performance all season. Cal Poly shot just 28.3% from the field and were only able to muster 17 points in the second half, allowing the Gauchos to walk away with the victory. Junior guard Devearl Ramsey had four steals ""î the most on the team ""î and set the defensive tone. UCSB created 14 points off of turnovers, which helped the Gauchos pull away early and keep the Mustangs at bay. Cal Poly couldn't buy a bucket against the UCSB defense, but the going was much easier on the other end. The Gauchos shot 51.1% from the field, hit 7 of their 14 threes and had few issues pulling away.† Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin led the Gauchos with 15 points and 3 three-pointers, to go along with 4 rebounds and 4 assists. Ramsey, somewhat surprisingly, led UCSB in rebounding with 8 boards, the first time the point guard has led the team in rebounding this season. The Gauchos now turn their attention to the Long Beach State team, which will travel north on Saturday to the Thunderdome. The Beach, at 5-12, have had a rough go of it this season. Some of Long Beach's struggles are a result of a brutal nonconference schedule. The Beach have played the 16th hardest schedule in the country, according to kenpom.com, with losses to several high-profile teams including No. 24 Arizona and St. Mary's.† Then again, the Beach have also often beaten themselves. LBSU turns the ball over 17.4 times per game, creating 18.5 points off of turnovers per game for the team's opponents. Long Beach's ball-security issues can be attributed in some measure to the tough schedule and to their scorching pace (34th in the nation according to Fox Sports), but the fact remains that the Beach make a lot of mistakes and create a lot of opportunities for their opponents. The Gauchos haven't been the most effective team when it comes to creating opponent turnovers and turning them into points, however. UCSB forced over 15 turnovers in just 2 of their 7 games in December and won't have the same physical and skill advantages that LBSU's more high-profile opponents had.† Saturday's matchup will be a clash of playstyles, with UCSB coming in at 330th in the nation in pace according to Fox Sports. Long Beach State will be eager to play fast, and whichever team succeeds in setting the pace will have a leg up on both ends of the court. Despite playing at a much slower pace than the Beach, the Gauchos will have their Saturday opponent beat in points per game, 73.7 to 68.6. The Long Beach State team pushes the pace and takes a lot of shots, but they don't make many of them with a 43.2% rate from the field and those turnovers create a lot of empty possessions. When the Beach does successfully turn one of the team's many possessions into points, it's often either sophomore guard Chance Hunter, sophomore guard Michael Carter III or junior guard Colin Slater doing the scoring. Hunter leads the team with 13.9 points per game, and Carter III and Slater are both in double-digits as well. Hunter is also second on the team in rebounding with 5.1 rebounds per game, only behind 6'11""ù freshman center Joshua Morgan, an impressive feat for a 6'6""ù player like Hunter. Carter, meanwhile, leads the Beach with 3.1 assists per game but turns the ball over 3.8 times per game. Long Beach State lacks significant size inside, which should present UCSB's sophomore forward Amadou Sow with offensive opportunities. Morgan is the only Beach player taller than 6'9""ù Sow, and at 195 pounds is at a disadvantage against the 235-pound Sow. Exploiting advantages, whether it's size or turnovers, will be the name of the game for the Gauchos on Saturday. If UCSB is able to turn Long Beach State's mistakes and size into stops and points, then they'll have a good shot at keeping the good times going.

sports,"Gauchos Host CSUN, Cal Poly to Open Conference Play",9-Jan-20,5:24 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/gauchos-host-csun-cal-poly-to-open-conference-play/," After an up-and-down non-conference schedule, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team will kick off conference play this week when they take on Cal State Fullerton and Cal Poly. Despite being voted to finish last in the Big West Media Preseason Poll, the Gauchos demonstrated their unbridled potential with key wins over both USC and San Diego State during the non-conference slate. Unfortunately, an inability to win on the road and consistency issues have plagued the ""òChos, who head into conference play with a 5-8 record. On Thursday, the Gauchos will face a significant test when they take on CSUF ""î who enter conference play in first place with an 8-5 record. For the Titans, it's been the Raina Perez show all year. The third-year guard easily leads the conference with 22.5 points per game and has done so with remarkable efficiency, shooting 53percent from the floor and 44.7 percent from deep. Even beyond Perez, CSUF has demonstrated its offensive prowess all season, averaging an impressive 71.5 points per game. With sophomore Amiee Book and junior Taylor Turney also averaging double figures, Fullerton leans heavily on its three guards for production. If the Gauchos hope to keep pace with the torrid Titans offense, they will need to force the ball out of Perez's hands and make her find her teammates. While Perez averages 4.2 assists per game, she also turns the ball over nearly four times per game herself. In addition, much of UCSB's success will hinge on the health of third-year point guard Danae Miller, who averages almost 14 points per game. After missing the Gauchos' blowout loss to Arizona, Miller was forced to leave the last game against Ottawa early after reaggravating her injury. With Miller heavily reliant on her explosiveness in the open court, the ""òChos will need a healthy Miller to keep pace with the Titans. Even with a fully operational Miller, UCSB will need to continue to lean on freshman Ila Lane if they hope to fight for a conference title this year. One of the biggest surprises so far this season, Lane has averaged an eye-popping 12.8 rebounds per game this year ""î good for third in the entire country. On offense, Lane provides the Gauchos with a highly efficient post option, with the first year averaging 14.4 points per game on 58.2 percent shooting from the floor. With the Titans allowing nearly 70 points per game, look for Thursday's game to be a high-scoring affair between two overachieving teams. Things won't get any easier for UCSB on Saturday when they host Cal Poly in an early rendition of the Blue-Green rivalry game. While the Mustangs limp into the game with a 3-8 record ""î including a winless road record ""î don't expect Cal Poly to go down easy in a heated rivalry game. Similarly to UCSB, the Mustangs prefer to play inside-out on offense, with third-year forward Sierra Campisano leading the charge offensively with 17 points per game. However, much of Cal Poly's offensive struggles come down to their inability to score outside of the paint. Of their 58.4 points per game as a team, Cal Poly scores on average fewer than 12 points from behind the arc. In large part, freshman guard Abbey Ellis provides the team's only real threat from deep, and even she has only shot 27.8 percent this season on the long ball. While Lane and Campisano will battle in the post-all game, the Gauchos will need one of their outside scorers to step up to take advantage of the Mustangs' limitations. After an inconsistent stroke from deep last year, Tal Sahar has proved to be lethal from deep this year, shooting more than 35 percent. If Sahar can find her range from behind the arc, UCSB should be able to handle Cal Poly, especially in front of a home crowd. With two difficult home games to kick off conference play, UCSB has the opportunity to start conference play with a bang this week. The Gauchos will host CSUF on Thursday at 7 p.m. before taking on Cal Poly at 2 p.m. Saturday at the Thunderdome. Comments are closed.

The Gauchos finished last season as the No. 5 team in the country with an 18-10 record, racking up several impressive wins over the course of the year. Some victories that stood out include 3-0 sweeps of No. 3 BYU on back-to-back days, a 3-2 win vs. No. 2 UCLA and a 3-1 win over then-No. 5 Loyola Chicago. This year, the Gauchos will be without several key players who graduated, including standout outside hitter Corey Chavers, opposite Matt Ujkic and outside hitter/libero Hayden Boehle. Chavers led the Gauchos in 2019 with 370 kills with a season average of 3.4 kills per set. Boehle saw some notoriety for his impressive season, finishing as a finalist for the Erik Shoji Award, an honor given to the best Libero in all of collegiate men's volleyball. Both Chavers and Boehle earned Second-Team All-American honors for their strong play in their final college season.† Despite the loss of these valuable pieces, UCSB should continue to play good volleyball, bringing back seven players for their fourth and final run as Gauchos. Notable returning seniors for UCSB include opposite Spencer Fredrick out of Lynwood, California, setter Casey McGarry and outside hitter Roy McFarland. My preseason presumption is that UCSB shouldn't have many on-court chemistry imbalances or leadership blunders, given that these seniors have now been playing with one another for around four years. Along with these seniors, an exciting prospect is returning to UCSB for his second season. Ryan Wilcox earned Freshman of the Year honors in the Big West Conference for his outstanding play as an outside hitter. Wilcox finished the 2019 year ranked No. 2 on the team in kills (254) and digs (121). Along with this, he was awarded Big West Freshman of the Week honors four times throughout the year. If UCSB wants continuous success this season, Wilcox should be a focal point of their offensive attack. UCSB comes into the new decade ranked No. 2 in the Big West Conference, with high hopes that they will compete in the conference championship game. The Gaucho men's team kicks off their 2020 season this weekend as they host the Asics Invitational. This is the third consecutive year UCSB has hosted the tournament, with this year including UCSB, Long Beach State, Cal State Northridge, Concordia, Mckendree and Benedictine Mesa. The Gauchos square off against Concordia in their season opener.† Last year, the Gauchos went 3-0 in this tournament racking up wins against Harvard, Grand Canyon and Concordia. Santa Barbara is hopeful to have similar success in this year's tournament. UCSB's opening round match versus Concordia tips off at 3 p.m. on Thursday; on the following day, Santa Barbara hosts Benedictine University at Mesa at 5:30 p.m. Finally, they wrap up their series of games with Mckendree at 8 p.m. If you want to support the UCSB men's volleyball team, all of the games will be hosted in Rob Gym this weekend.

sports,Women's Water Polo Looks to Build Off Historic Season,9-Jan-20,5:30 AM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-09/womens-water-polo-looks-to-build-off-historic-season/,"Sarah Snyder puts up a strong defense. Nexus File Photo The UCSB women's water polo team will have championship aspirations on its mind as the 2019-20 season gets set to kick off next week. The Gauchos will be looking to build off a historic 2018-19 campaign that included a program-record 22 wins, a record-tying five All-Big West selections and a third-place finish in the Big West Tournament. While the team's postseason run fell just short of the Big West Championship game last year after losing 2-5 to UC Irvine in the semifinals, UCSB managed to put together one of the most complete seasons in program history behind the strong leadership of its senior captains. One of the biggest challenges for women's water polo this upcoming season will be replacing the production of utility Kate Pipkin. Pipkin finished her illustrious career as a Gaucho with a prolific senior season, leading the team in 118 attempted shots and 76 points. She was selected to the All-Big West First Team for her efforts and also received national recognition when she was named a Division 1 All-American by the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches. The hole left by her departure in terms of the sheer volume of both goals and opportunities that she created will have to be filled by committee this season, but this year's team certainly has the talent to do it. Two players that will be vital to UCSB's success moving forward are seniors Sarah Snyder and Kenzi Snyder. Sarah Snyder has consistently been the Gauchos' most lethal scorer since her sophomore year, and she took it to another level this past season. The utility notched a team-leading 66 goals in 2019, good for third in the Big West Conference and the first 60-goal performance by a Gaucho in six years. She earned her second straight All-Conference selection as well, moving up from Third-Team All-Big West to Second-Team All-Big West. One of the most intriguing storylines to keep an eye out for will be her adjustment in taking on more of a leadership role this year and whether that bolsters or slows her production. On the defensive end, Kenzi Snyder has solidified her status as one of the top goalkeepers in the conference. Last season, she was the only player on the roster to win multiple Big West Player of the Week awards, she ended the year third in the conference in 187 saves and she was ultimately selected to the All-Big West Second Team, all while sharing goalie duties with junior Becca Buck.
Snyder's ability to make clutch saves was the determining factor in a large number of the team's wins last year, and it will be crucial again this season if the Gauchos hope to make a deeper postseason run. UCSB is actually starting the season off with a bang as they're set to face off against some of the top teams in the country when they host the UCSB Invitational next weekend. The Gauchos will host both UCLA and UC Berkeley, who finished off last season ranked No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, as well as Iona and Michigan in their inaugural tournament. The competition will not get any easier when conference season rolls around, as April matchups at UC Irvine and against Hawaii will again pit the Gauchos against top-10 teams in the country. This UCSB women's water polo team has the talent necessary to improve on their record-breaking season last year, but new leaders will have to step up to replace the big names who graduated this summer. It will be up to Coach Serela Kay to unlock this squad's potential, because if everything goes to plan, this will be one of the most complete teams in the country.

sports,Gauchos Drop Conference Opener to CSUF in Overtime,12-Jan-20,1:46 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-12/gauchos-drop-conference-opener-to-csuf-in-overtime/," Despite leading for more than 30 minutes on Thursday, the UCSB women's basketball team fell short against Cal State Fullerton, losing 70-68 in overtime. Coming into the game against the first-place Titans, the Gauchos knew their success would largely hinge on their ability to stop Raina Perez ""î a third-year guard averaging nearly 23 points per game for CSUF. For four quarters, the UCSB defense executed their game plan to perfection, holding Perez to 16 points on 23 shots. With swarming perimeter defense ""î as well as the looming presence of 6'4'' freshman center Ila Lane inside ""î Perez was consistently forced to jack up contested midrange jumpers. Despite Perez's struggles in regulation, Fullerton managed to hang around against a motivated Gauchos squad. Every time UCSB looked poised to run away with the game, a resilient Titans team would answer with a run of their own. After trailing by as much as 14 in the second quarter, CSUF finished the half on a 12-0 tear, led in large part by junior guard Taylor Turney. With the Gauchos keying in on Perez, Turney took advantage of the extra space, finishing the game with 20 points on 9-16 shooting from the floor ""î including a vital 13 points in the first half. ""úWe made some adjustments on Turney [in the second half], but it was too late,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. The Titans also made some key defensive adjustments in the second half to limit the production of freshman phenom Lane. Lane dominated in the first half, scoring 11 points on 83% shooting. In the second half, however, the Titans began to double and triple team Lane in the post, making her either force a tough shot or try to pass out of the post. While Lane still finished with an impressive 15 points and 15 rebounds, she shot merely 29% from the floor in the second half. With Lane occupying so much attention, much of the Gauchos playmaking in the second half and overtime fell on the shoulders of junior point guard Danae Miller. Despite coming back from an injury, Miller looked no worse for wear, finishing the game with 27 points and constantly blowing by Fullerton defenders. In the fourth quarter and overtime, Henrickson mostly played Miller off the ball, allowing her to focus on scoring more than running the offense. Outside of Miller, however, the UCSB offense was largely stagnant in the fourth quarter and overtime. The Gauchos entered the fourth quarter with a 6-point lead, but were held to only 7 points in the entire quarter, shooting 17% from the floor while also turning the ball over four times. ""úWe weren't aggressive at all in the fourth quarter,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe need to put the ball in the middle of the floor more, and get [Lane] good touches and deep catches.""ù After Miller missed a contested layup with 6 seconds left to go, Perez had a deep three rim out, forcing overtime between the two sides. †In overtime, Perez took over, scoring seven of the Titan's 10 points in the quarter ""î including a dagger three with a minute to go that gave CSUF a two-possession lead. Even with her cold shooting, Perez finished the game with 23 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists. ""úTurney and Perez are who they are ""î they are two phenomenal playmakers in this league,""ù Henrickson said. In heartbreaking fashion, the Gauchos fell to 5-9 on the season, including 0-1 in the conference. Meanwhile, Fullerton moves to 9-5 overall and 1-0 in the conference. Comments are closed.

sports,Danae Miller's Late-Game Winner Propels Gauchos Past Mustangs,13-Jan-20,9:11 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-13/danae-millers-late-game-winner-propels-gauchos-past-mustangs/," With 15 seconds left on the game clock and the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team down by one, junior guard Danae Miller made her move. Despite struggling with both her shot and foul trouble the entire night, Miller drove downhill, finishing the and-one to give UCSB a 52-50 lead ""î a lead they would not relinquish in their victory over rival Cal Poly on Saturday. ""úWe started moving and sharing the ball, so there was room at the rim for [Miller],""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. UCSB started the game on the front foot, jumping out to an 18-10 lead after the first quarter. Importantly, the Gauchos forced junior forward Sierra Campisano out of the game with foul trouble ""î something she struggled with throughout the entire night. In total, Campisano logged merely 14 minutes on Saturday, ending the game with two points and two rebounds.† In the second quarter, however, the Gauchos offense struggled to get anything going. With stud freshman Ila Lane in foul trouble, UCSB hemorrhaged points in the paint and struggled to box out the Mustangs. Cal Poly scored their last seven points of the quarter in the paint, and after a dominant first quarter, the Gauchos found themselves down 28-24 at halftime. In addition to her foul trouble, Lane was kept in check by the swarming paint defense of Cal Poly. While she grabbed 11 rebounds, Lane finished the game with only 2 points ""î her season low ""î on 1-4 shooting from the floor. With very little working offensively for the ""òChos in both the second and third quarter, the team leaned heavily on the craftiness of senior guard Coco Miller to create offense. Every time the Mustangs threatened to pull away in the third quarter, Coco would hit a 3-pointer to re-energize the Gauchos, including after Cal Poly opened up a 12-point lead. In one of her finest performances of the season, Coco finished the game with 24 of the team's 52 points, shooting 64 percent from deep on 11 attempts. Halfway through the third quarter, Henrickson instructed the team to come out in a zone defense in an attempt to force Cal Poly to shoot from distance. The strategy worked to a tee; after trailing 42-30 with 1:53 left in the third quarter, UCSB only gave up eight points the rest of the game. Most importantly, in the fourth quarter, the sputtering UCSB offense came to life. After entering the game, junior Mira Shulman helped to kickstart the offense by probing and stretching the defense, creating space for the rest of the offense to operate. After a good dish from Coco, Shulman drained a 3-pointer in the corner to cut UCSB's deficit to six points. Minutes later, Shulman returned the favor, hitting Coco for a 3-pointer that cut the Mustang lead to one point. ""úMira gave us huge minutes today,""ù Henrickson said. ""úShe was a ball mover when she came on the floor.""ù After briefly taking the lead, the Mustangs answered back with a 3-pointer to take the lead with 38 seconds left, 50-49. But Danae gave the Gauchos the lead for good with 10 seconds left on her drive, and UCSB came away with their first conference victory of the season. ""úWe had a great first and fourth quarter, but we gotta get a great 40 minutes at some point,""ù Henrickson said. The Gauchos now move to 6-9 on the season and are 1-1 in conference play. After opening their conference slate with two difficult home games, UCSB will now travel to take on both UC Irvine and UC Riverside this week. Comments are closed.

sports,Loss to Long Beach State Just a Hiccup Along the Path to Glory,13-Jan-20,9:20 AM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-13/loss-to-long-beach-state-just-a-hiccup-along-the-path-to-glory/," The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team has dropped their first conference game of the season in a dogfight of a match at home against Long Beach State. The Beach (6-12 overall, 1-1 conference) defeated the Gauchos (12-5 overall, 1-1 conference) 55-52 on the back of Chance Hunter's game-leading 16 points.† The loss not only gives UCSB its first conference loss of the season, it snaps a six-game win streak that began with a win over Idaho State back in mid-December.† Long Beach, despite the exit of Deishuan Booker and the fact that the team fielded a completely different starting five players than the last time these two teams met, found victory in the basics of the game.† The Beach finished the game with a 50% shooting percentage at (25-50) while the Gauchos were held to a measly 32% at 16-50.† It was last year when these two teams last met and when Long Beach handed UCSB another stout loss. That game also featured four final home career performances from Gauchos Ar'mond Davis, Jarriesse Blackmon, Ami Lakoju and Maxwell Kupchak. Booker, who now plays his ball for ERA Nymburk of the Czech National League, carried the offense with 26 points off a 9-14 clip. Ferociously intent on winning, Booker would score 17 points in the second half with a good-enough supplementary performance from Jordan Roberts. Roberts posted a 16/3/3 line and shot 43% from the floor while senior forward Mason Rigggins snagged 9 rebounds, blocked a shot and added 6 points.† Riggins, a 6-foot-5 and 230-pound force in the paint, was his typical effective and versatile self. His nine boards were a combination of 4 offensive rebounds and 5 defensive ones, while he also shot 50% from the floor.† With guard Drew Cobb starting this game on the bench, Long Beach had officially rolled out a completely different lineup than its last match against UCSB.† For UCSB, their men of the match were the same three that played in last year's meeting: guards JaQuori McLaughlin and Devearl Ramsey, and forward Amadou Sow McLaughlin and Ramsey remain the only two Gauchos to have started in both matches, but Sow indeed played an impressive role in his relief of senior Kupchak the last time. Sow posted 13 points off a 54.5% clip while also having added 15 boards, 1 steal and 3 blocks.† He would have yet another fine performance in mimicry of that last match, though UCSB would fail to do more than dip a toe in the water.† UCSB fell to Long Beach State 52-55 this past Saturday after failing to keep up with their shooting.† The Gauchos finished the game leaders in rebounds (35-29) and steals (8-3) but were just marginal losers in assists (12-13) and blocks (2-4). Even with the points from their 13-19 record at the line, compared to Long Beach's 1-3 showing, the Gauchos failed to make baskets and ultimately lost because of it.† While McLaughlin, Ramsey and Sow all provided valuable performances in their bid for redemption, the Gauchos simply did not shoot the basketball as well as Long Beach State and lost because of it.† Sow's 67% clip from the floor was eclipsed only by Long Beach freshman Joshua Morgan (5-7) and Roberts (3-4). Ramsey was the next best shooter for the Gauchos, completing 2 of his 5 shots. He also added points from 4-4 shooting at the line.† Sitting at third in the Big West, the UCSB men's basketball team has gotten off to a fine start to the season and currently has a 12-5 record overall and are just 1-1 in conference play thus far.† While everything was seemingly setting up the Gauchos for a big win, the most basic part of the game was forgotten: shooting the basketball.† It's a tough loss, but it was a fine performance in a lot of ways ""î just a hiccup.† The third-place Gauchos are back at it Saturday when they travel to fourth-place Hawai'i. The game starts at 10 p.m. PST.†

The quartet's performance on the court ""î despite assuming new roles on it, as with DeWeese ""î reflected the seniors' skills and experiences as individual players and as teammates.† The Gauchos' weekend closed with a match versus McKendree (1-2 overall), in which they swept the Illinois roster with set scores of 25-19, 25-17 and 25-16. UCSB's showing undoubtedly destabilized McKendree's lineup, whose bleak presence was overshadowed by a seasoned Santa Barbara roster. With a steady flow of kills and a consistent system of defense across the UCSB starters, the team never dropped their lead throughout all 3 sets. In a bold experimental lineup, Head Coach Rick McLaughlin tested Haotian Xia as an outside hitter and Roy McFarland as an opposite. The sophomore-senior corners took control of the offense, each contributing 10 kills. Senior McGarry also topped SB with 5 digs.† Sophomore Brandon Hicks executed a successful 8 kills out of 9 total attempts, finishing the game with the highest kill percentage of the day at .889. Hicks backed up his offensive performance with 3 block assists.† This last game, however, was only the culmination of a rolling victory wave that had begun two days prior. In its opening match, UCSB faced Concordia-Irvine, who, in retrospect, posed the first and really only threat to their reign. Concordia fought back after their first 2 set defeats, pushing the third, though unsuccessfully, to an ultimate 24-26 loss. The game record played out favorably for the Gauchos as follows: 25-15, 25-16, 26-24. Here, DeWeese made his 2020 debut as the Gauchos' outside hitter, stepping away from his usual position as a setter. 14 kills later, the Sacramento native's undeniable performance proved his seamless transition to his new spot.† Fellow seniors McFarland and Sanders backed up DeWeese's intimidating presence, each racking up 7 kills apiece (with Sanders reaching a .700 kill percentage). Yould would earn a large part of his All-Tournament title here with an impressive 8 digs.† McGarry matched his teammate's 8 digs in the Gauchos' second game against Benedictine University, his highest dig count out of the three games. The Manhattan Beach local, named as well to the All-Tournament Team, finished the invitational with 17 total digs and an overall standout coverage of the court.† The skill-packed, nationally-ranked Santa Barbara lineup was hardly a relief for the Benedictine Redhawks, who had come off of a loss against No. 5 Cal State Long Beach the day before. The Gauchos again swept Benedictine Mesa with ease, winning 25-12, 25-21, 25-18. Here, sophomore Ryan Wilcox stood out with 15 kills, the highest number among the team over the course of the weekend. Though the Gauchos avoided more threatening competitors like Long Beach, they nonetheless will be bolstered by their electric debut. Their consistency across the board will be crucial as they look to the near future where the team will face increasingly more challenging opponents such as Stanford, USC and UC Irvine. For now, the team is preparing to take on Purdue Fort Wayne and Ball State this upcoming weekend.††

sports,Gauchos Put Perfect Record to the Test Against No. 10 Mastodons,16-Jan-20,5:22 AM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/gauchos-put-perfect-record-to-the-test-against-no-10-mastodons/,"† Nexus File Photo The 3-0 UC Santa Barbara men's volleyball team will look to remain undefeated this Friday when it hosts 2-0 Purdue Fort Wayne. Purdue Fort Wayne comes in at No. 10 in the country after an impressive start to their season. The Mastodons knocked off Queens and Belmont Abbey handily in their season openers, and they will be making the long trip from Indiana to Santa Barbara for a chance at upsetting the No. 4 team in the nation, UCSB.† The Gauchos, on the other hand, come into this match as winners of their first three games by dominant fashion. They went undefeated at the annual UCSB Invitational, racking up clean 3-0 sweeps of Concordia, Benedictine University at Mesa and McKendree University. UCSB played great and couldn't have asked for a better start to their season. Hopefully, the Gauchos can maintain this high level of play and continue to accumulate wins like these over the course of the long season. UCSB looked solid over the weekend's series of games, averaging a combined 13.56 kills per set off 12.89 assists per set. Their offensive attack looked stout, picking up kills at an alarming rate, at nearly 40%. Although the entire Gaucho roster played well, two players really stood out over the course of the weekend. In their opening game of the season, senior setter Randy DeWeese picked up 14 kills in 3 sets. After averaging just 0.51 kills per set in his first three years as a Gaucho, perhaps this is a new role that coach Rick McLaughlin has in mind for DeWeese this year. And lastly, sophomore outside hitter Ryan Wilcox came out swinging versus Benedictine University at Mesa, earning 15 kills in just three sets. This isn't anything Gaucho fans haven't seen before, as Wilcox proved several times last year that he is the real deal. He earned Big West Freshman of the Year honors as well as Big West Player of the Week four times for his exceptional play last season. If UCSB wants to avoid being upset by up-and-coming Purdue Fort Wayne, they can't underestimate their opponent's abilities. Purdue Fort Wayne has been playing well amidst a strong schedule. Their offensive attack has been led by a freshman, Jon Diedrich, who has been playing lights out to start the season. Diedrich had an eye-opening 28 and 20 kills in his team's first two matches. The 6-foot-6-inch outside hitter could be a potential problem for UCSB's defense. UCSB's defensive anchors this year have been their seniors, with all four of the Gaucho players averaging more than one dig per set graduating this year. Spencer Fredrick (2.75 d/s), Casey McGarry (1.89 d/s), Grady Yould (1.78 d/s) and Ryan DeWeese (1.56 d/s) will need to continue to play at a high level if they want to slow down Diedrich and Purdue Fort Wayne's explosive offense. A road win against a highly ranked team like UCSB would be huge for the landscape of Purdue Fort Wayne's season, whereas UCSB looks to maintain their perfect home record going into league play. It will be a close match as both of these teams have something to prove early in the season. If you want to come out and support your Gauchos, the opening serve is this Friday Jan. 17 at 7 pm in Robertson Gym.†

sports,Gauchos Travel South Looking To End Road Woes,16-Jan-20,5:20 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/gauchos-travel-south-looking-to-end-road-woes/,"Nexus File Photo After a crazy first week of conference play that featured an overtime loss and a late game-winner, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team (6-9, 1-1) proved they will be a competitive force in the Big West. This week, the team will look to exorcise their road demons when they travel to take on UC Irvine and UC Riverside. On paper, the Big West looked to be wide open this season, and the first week of conference play seemed to confirm that notion. Out of the eight conference games last week, only one game was decided by double figures: UC Davis' 13-point victory over Hawai'i on Saturday. Behind the interior dominance of freshman forward-center Ila Lane, UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) seems to be in the thick of the conference race. In the ""òChos near loss to conference-favorite Fullerton, Lane secured her ninth double-double of the season, finishing with 15 points and 15 rebounds. Saturday, however, the Gauchos proved they could win even without much production from Lane. With Lane both in foul trouble and constantly doubled in the post, she finished with only 4 points. In her stead, senior guard Coco Miller showed off her playmaking ability, scoring 24 points and draining 7 crucial 3-pointers. Even in a sloppy offensive performance ""î one in which the team scored a mere 52 points on 38.3% shooting ""î UCSB proved on Saturday that it could grind its way to a win if needed. This week, the Gauchos will need to combine that grit with a solid offensive performance if they hope to finish the week with two victories. Despite their overall 6-9 record, the ""òChos have yet to win on the road this season, losing their first five away games. Last year, UCSB finished the season with a less-than-impressive 1-13 record on the road. On Thursday, Santa Barbara will look to pick up its first road victory of the season in a matchup against UC Irvine (UCI). Irvine entered the season with high expectations, but those expectations have since been tempered due to an injury to star senior guard Jordan Sanders. After leading the Anteaters in scoring last season, Sanders has only suited up for seven games this season. Shortly after Sanders' injury earlier this year, UCI lost eight straight games ""î a streak only recently ended in their matchup against Westcliff University. Still, the Anteaters pose a threat to Santa Barbara, especially in front of their home crowd. Senior guard Lauren Saiki leads the charge for the undermanned squad, averaging 11.7 points per game. However, with UCI desperately searching for offense in Sanders' absence, the team has arguably leaned too heavily on Saiki, who is shooting a mere 32% from the floor. Perhaps the biggest concern for UCI will be who can match up with Lane underneath. On average, Irvine has been out-rebounded by almost 6 rebounds per game this season. The injury to Sanders ""î who led the team in rebounding at the time of her injury ""î has only exacerbated that problem. With the Anteaters likely to double Lane in the post, look for junior guard Danae Miller and Coco Miller to exploit the extra space on the perimeter. After their Thursday matchup, UCSB will have to quickly regroup before its Saturday matchup against UC Riverside (UCR). Riverside slumped during much of non-conference play, finishing with a 4-10 record, but took care of business last Thursday in their 75-70 victory over UC Davis. In that game, senior guard Jannon Otto dominated, dropping 26 points on only 15 field goal attempts. Despite their success on Thursday, the Highlanders have in large part struggled on the offensive end this season, averaging only 57.1 points per game. Much of that comes down to their inability to take care of the ball, with the team giving the ball away more than 20 times per game. Unlike Irvine, UCR has the potential to keep Lane off the glass for the Gauchos. Senior forward Marina Ewodo grabs 7.2 boards per game, and Otto actually paces the team with 7.6 rebounds per game. With the Highlanders actually out rebounding opponents this season by 2.7 rebounds per game, there will be a far smaller margin for error for the Gauchos on offense. The Gauchos will take on Irvine Thursday at 7 p.m., before traveling down to Riverside and matching up with the Highlanders on Saturday at 7 p.m.

sports,No. 11 UCSB Women's Water Polo To Host Winter Invite,16-Jan-20,12:14 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-16/no-11-ucsb-womens-water-polo-to-host-winter-invite/,"Attacker Shannon Moran looks for a pass. Nexus File Photo The 2019-20 UC Santa Barbara women's water polo season will get underway this weekend as the Gauchos host their inaugural UCSB Winter Invite. Teams from all over the country will make their way to the Campus Pool for the competitive season opening slate of games, including highly lauded squads like No. 2 UCLA, No. 4 Cal and No. 7 Michigan, that No.11 UCSB will all face at some point in the weekend. The Gauchos will kick things off against the Bruins on Friday evening.† The last time these two teams met was in last year's Winter Invite, when then No. 3 UCLA defeated then No. 17 UCSB 6-4 in the final day of matches. It was a tightly contested matchup until the fourth period, as utility Sarah Snyder scored a brace to keep the Gauchos in the game until the Bruins scored a few goals late in the match. Now in her senior year, Snyder will again have to show out for UCSB to have success not just in the opener, but throughout the season. Snyder led the team in goals last season (66) and also was selected to the All-Big West Second Team, while her younger sister utility Caitlyn Snyder made a splash with 30 goals and a team-leading 33 assists to go along with her Big West All-Freshman selection. If the sibling duo can continue their production from last season early on, it will be a great sign for the team moving forward. UCSB has two games scheduled for Saturday, the first in the morning coming against Iona and the second being a mid-day marquee matchup against UC Berkeley. The Golden Bears will be a relatively new opponent for Santa Barbara, as their game last year was cancelled. Cal is a traditional water polo powerhouse, and this year's team maintains that tradition with plenty of potential olympians. One standout star on the team so far is junior goalkeeper Cassidy Ball, who was just named Mountain Pacific Sports Federation player of the week after notching 12 saves and an unusual goal in the team's season opening win against San Jose State. On the other hand, the Gauchos should feel comfortable going up against the Iona Gaels, if last year's 14-0 whalloping is any indication. That matchup in the 2019 ASU Cross Conference Challenge ended up being the only shutout of the season for UCSB with current junior Becca Buck's goalkeeping leading the way. Buck and senior Kenzi Snyder will be sharing the majority of the goalie duties this season for Santa Barbara, as both are looking to build off of a great 2018-19 season. The former had a solid sophomore season in the goal, notching a career-high 107 saves on the year to go along with a .677 save percentage. Snyder put together an incredible junior campaign, leading the team in saves (211), winning multiple Big West Player of the Week awards and ultimately earning a spot on the All-Big West Second Team as well. The pair of goalies will be the key to anchoring the defense as the season wears on, and it will be interesting to see if freshman goalkeeper Lucy Jackman can earn some minutes as well. The Gauchos close out the weekend with a pair of games on Sunday against Michigan and Ottawa University ""ì Arizona. The Wolverines have the potential to be the toughest opponent that UCSB will face all weekend, as they are coming off of an extremely successful 2018-19 season. Michigan made it to the NCAA Tournament for the fourth time in a row and also won its fourth straight Collegiate Water Polo Association championship last year. Although they ended up losing a few seniors from that championship squad, which included a few members of the Australian national team, this is still an experienced and hungry team looking for a hot start. This opening slate of games will be a great opportunity for UCSB to see how it currently measures up against some of the top teams in the country. While the Gauchos have a long season ahead of them, it would be nice to get off to a hot start.

There, they'll take on fourth-place Hawai'i in what should be a highlight reel match between two of the best the Big West has to offer.† UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) will come into the match winners in 11 of their last 13 games including a sensational victory in this year's first rendition of the Blue-Green rivalry.† That game was also UCSB's opening match in conference play, where they now have a record of 1-1 after last Saturday's nail-biter of a loss to Long Beach State at the Thunderdome.† Gaucho junior guard Devearl Ramsey opened his account early with a dominant defensive showing in the opener against Cal Poly. Ramsey collected 8 defensive rebounds, dished out 2 helpers, had 4 steals and then decided to add 6 points off of a 3-6 showing on the floor. He followed that up with a 10/3/5 line, 3-steal performance against Long Beach State. Expect him to play a big role in this weekend's match.† UCSB's junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin put up 15 points in each of these past two games. He's got sophomore forward Amadou Sow in tandem who scored 13 and 15 in each of the two, respectively.† Despite the solid performances from around the court, the Gauchos opened the season 1-1 because they did and didn't do the basics.† They followed up a 51% shooting percentage from the floor against the Mustangs with a 32% showing against Long Beach State. Had Sow not shot 6-9, UCSB would have finished the night at 24%.† Regardless, no team could expect to find themselves at the top of the conference with a 32% efficiency from the floor by season's end. Expect the Gauchos to have a much better night with the ball in their hands come this weekend.† Every team in the conference has played two games, save for two: UC Irvine and UC Davis. The Anteaters took down Hawai'i in their opener while the Aggies saw different results against UC Riverside.† So while UCSB seemingly broke down during their loss, Hawai'i lost to last year's champs ""î champs who swept their season series against the Gauchos.† Even if it's a small sample size, 2-0 is still better than 1-1 and Hawai'i might be looking more like a 2-0. The Gauchos will lose if they underestimate the Rainbow Wahine.† Prior to the loss, Hawai'i took down Cal State Fullerton 75-69 in their season opener.† Senior guard Eddie Stansberry was a scoring machine, dangling and dazzling his way to 25 points and a 10-15 record from the floor.† Both teams finished just about equal in field goal percentage and free throws made while Hawai'i made 20% more of their 3-point attempts. A couple more threes and you get the 6-point win the Rainbow Wahine did.† That same fiery sniper was more of a disengaged grunt, shooting a measly 3-13 against Irvine. Even though he did knock down three threes with a 3-9 performance, you can't win games with that kind of display. Stansberry, at 6'3""ù and 190 lbs, is still just a senior and you can expect a lot of ups and downs from him as the season continues.† Don't be shocked if he has another up night when the Gauchos get into town.† UCSB will make the transpacific trip to the Stan Sheriff Center this Saturday where they will take on Hawai'i. Game tips off at 10 p.m. PST.†

sports,"Gauchos Score 27 in Fourth, Knock off Anteaters",18-Jan-20,6:54 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-18/gauchos-score-27-in-fourth-knock-off-anteaters/," On the back of a 27-point fourth quarter, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team picked up their first road win of the season on Thursday, defeating UC Irvine 65-61. While Irvine (4-12, 0-2) has struggled for much of the season, the Anteaters pushed the Gauchos (7-9, 2-1) to the brink in front of their home crowd. In large part, UCI's swarming defense ""î coupled with sloppy play by UCSB ""î kept Irvine in the lead for much of the night. Santa Barbara turned the ball over 18 times on Thursday, while only forcing 10 turnovers throughout the night. For Irvine, freshman forward Sophia Locandro carried the load on offense, scoring 20 points on 67% shooting from the floor while also adding 8 rebounds on the night. But perhaps the biggest factor in Irvine's early lead was freshman Ila Lane's foul trouble. The 6'4""ù forward picked up 2 fouls in the first quarter, and was forced to sit the entirety of the second quarter to avoid picking up her third foul. Lane actually finished the half scoreless, and without production from Lane, the UCSB offense sputtered to a measly 18 points in the first half. Coming into the game, much was made of the ""òChos' potential advantage on the glass against an Irvine team that struggles to rebound. Despite being outrebounded by almost 6 boards per game this season, UCI actually grabbed 2 more rebounds in the first half than UCSB. Unsurprisingly, the Gauchos trailed Irvine by 5 at the half. With UCSB's starters struggling for much of the night, the Gauchos needed some sort of spark off the bench to come back against the upstart Anteaters. That spark actually came in the form of two players: junior forward Mira Shulman and senior guard Tal Sahar. In the third quarter, with UCSB down by 12 points, Shulman hit 2 key 3-pointers off the bench en-route to an 8-point quarter for the walk-on. In total, Shulman would finish with 10 crucial points ""î her first double-digit performance of the season. At the end of the third quarter, the Gauchos were able to pull the deficit to only 5 points. In the fourth quarter, Sahar showed off her range, hitting both of her 3-pointer attempts. Sahar would finish the game with 14 points ""î the second highest output on the team. The UCSB bench scored 28 points, accounting for nearly half of the team's total score. After not playing in the second quarter and not scoring in the first half, Lane provided UCSB with one of the most dominant fourth quarters in recent memory. Lane would finish the quarter with a resounding 17 points and 6 rebounds, absolutely bullying the Anteater interior defense and showing off why she averages a double-double. Perhaps most impressively, Lane accomplished the feat on only 7 field goals in the quarter, and only turned the ball over once despite her high usage in the post. Behind Lane's theatrics, UCSB went from a 5-point deficit to a 6-point lead with 3:27 left in the quarter. In addition, UCSB dominated on the boards in the second half; after being outrebounded in the first half, the Gauchos outrebounded the Anteaters by 20 in the second half. With the impressive fourth quarter comeback, the Gauchos now move to 2-1in the conference ""î good for fourth place in the Big West. Next up, UCSB heads down to Riverside to take on UC Riverside on Saturday at 7 p.m. Comments are closed.

Seniors Sarah Snyder and Kenzi Snyder made their mark early on in this opening slate of matches.† Sarah knocked in a team-high 4 goals in No. 11 UCSB's first game of the season against UCLA on Friday, continuing her run as one of the Gauchos' deadliest scorers and back-to-back years of leading the program in goals scored.† The utility helped push UCSB's lead all the way up to 7-4 by the start of the fourth quarter, but the Bruins wouldn't go down without a fight as they whittled down the lead back to one with just minutes remaining in the match. Just as it seemed like UCSB had lost all momentum, goalkeeper Kenzi stepped up and made a few clutch saves† that prevented the Bruins from retaking the lead, and the Gauchos beat UCLA for the first time since 1995. UCSB carried the momentum from the season opener into Saturday's match against the Iona Gaels, who the team handily defeated 12-4. It was all Santa Barbara from the jump in this matchup, as the team got out to a quick 6-0 lead and never looked back. Eight different Gauchos notched a goal, and sophomore Caitlyn Snyder led the way with a team-leading 3-goal outing to go along with an assist.† Caitlyn is fresh off her Big West All-Freshman Team selection and looks to be gunning for another All-Conference Team this season with her goal production so far. UCSB wasn't able to remain perfect for too long, however, as the No. 4 Cal Golden Bears handed the Gauchos their first loss on Saturday night. Sarah knocked in two goals in the first period, and UCSB actually looked to be primed for another upset as the team took a 5-4 lead into halftime. Still, the second half was all UC Berkeley as the Golden Bears shut out the Gauchos and scored four goals of their own to claim the 8-5 lead. Santa Barbara had to turn around and take on arguably its toughest opponent of the weekend on Sunday as the No. 7 Michigan Wolverines came to town. The team has been one of the best water polo programs in the country over the last few years, boasting multiple Olympic players as well as a four-year streak of qualifying for the NCAA tournament. Although multiple Gauchos were able to get on the board in this match ""î including sophomore attacker Amanda Legaspi, who was the first to score against both the Bruins and Wolverines ""î Michigan was able to control the tempo and maintain its lead the whole game. UCSB was only able to capitalize on one of its four penalty shots, and although the team poured in a few goals in the fourth quarter, it was just too little too late as the Wolverines won 9-7. The Gauchos closed out the weekend with a 19-2 blowout against Ottawa University-Arizona. The freshmen trio of Alex Mora, Courtney Heydorff and Evie Laptin scored 10 of UCSB's 19 goals in what was a resilient and emphatic turnaround after consecutive losses. Although the win against UCLA might have been the most important match of the weekend, this final game really showed the spirit and heart of this team. Bouncing back after two tough losses is no easy feat, and while the Gauchos came out of the Winter Invite with only one game over .500, they ultimately showed that they can compete with the best teams in the country.

The weekend was a busy one for the Gauchos, as they had a matchup with No. 10 Purdue University Fort Wayne on Friday and Ball State University on Saturday. UCSB came into these matches as one of the top teams in the country, holdingthe No. 3 spot in the country. They sure did look like one of the top college teams in the country racking up 3-0 sweeps of both Fort Wayne and Ball State. Purdue Fort Wayne came into Rob Gym on Friday with hopes of a big-time upset on the road, but they were left sorrily mistaken. UCSB was firing on all cylinders in this one, posting their highest hitting percentage of the year, at an eye-opening 51%. The Gauchos had a balanced attack the whole night, as senior setter Casey McGarry spread the wealth offensively, picking up his fourth straight 30+ assist match (32 assists versus Fort Wayne). McGarry was the previous winner of the Off the Block Setter of the Week honors, and he proved deserving after Friday's impressive performance.† Ball State had similar hopes to Purdue Fort Wayne entering Saturday's contest, but unfortunately for them, they ended up leaving Santa Barbara with the same results, a 0-3 loss. The standout of the match for UCSB was senior setter Randy DeWeese. DeWeese has been like a swiss army knife for the Gauchos, being able to do a multitude of things for coach Rick McLaughlin. Against Ball State, he had 3 block assists and a game-high 10 kills. DeWeese's offensive game this year has been something to see, as he has led UCSB in kills during several of their first matches ""î not something you see too often from a setter.† UCSB is off to a blazing start to the season, 3-0, sweeping every team they have matched up with so far. They have a 5-0 record now, and by the looks of it, they don't seem to be slowing down, only improving as the year progresses. They do have a tough challenge ahead of them, as they travel north for a battle against the Cardinal. No. 8 Stanford will host No. 3 UCSB this Saturday, Jan. 25 at 5 p.m. Then the following weekend the Gauchos have a back-to-back go against No. 2 BYU on Friday, Jan. 31, and Saturday, Feb. 1.† If UCSB wants to maintain their perfect year they are going to have to continue to block well and keep up their superb offensive attack. Stanford, like a lot of the top teams in the country, has a lot of weapons, and knowing which ones to stop is the key to success. In order to beat Stanford, UCSB should look out for the young talent outside hitter Will Rottman. Rottman was born and raised in Santa Barbara and stood out in his four years at Santa Barbara High School. He is only a freshman, but at this point, he is third on the team in kills and ranks near the top in kill percentage.† Expect Rottman and the rest of Stanford's roster to come out swinging versus UCSB, in an attempt at upsetting the unbeaten Gauchos. There may be a little extra motivation for Rottman as he goes up against his hometown team and his father's alma mater (where he also played volleyball). However, I don't think UCSB will be fazed, as they have started the year dominating teams. The competition this year hasn't quite figured out how to challenge the Gauchos, as they have been connecting an astonishing 41% of their attempts. Stanford may struggle to defend UCSB's efficient offense, and for that reason, I think UCSB will take this one on the road.†

sports,"Behind Offensive Struggles, UCSB Falls To Hawai'i",21-Jan-20,8:53 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/behind-offensive-struggles-ucsb-falls-to-hawaii/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus A scoreless four-minute stretch to open the second half of Saturday's game against Hawai'i doomed the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team, which lost 63-70 in Honolulu.† The loss dropped the Gauchos to 12-6 on the season and 1-2 in Big West play, while the Rainbow Warriors improved to 12-6 and 3-0.† UCSB and Hawai'i went blow-for-blow in the first half, neither team able to crack open a sturdy lead. The Gauchos jumped ahead to start, the Rainbow Warriors swung back and took a 26-18 lead and UCSB closed the half on a 17-7 run to go up 35-33.† The Gauchos shot 44.7 % from the field and made just one 2 3-pointers, doing most of their damage from inside the arc instead. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin led the way with 10 points, while senior guard Max Heidegger and junior forward Robinson Idehen both chipped in 6 points off the bench. For whatever reason, the rim was much less hospitable to the Gauchos in the second half. A Max Heidegger layup, almost four minutes into the half, provided UCSB's first points of the period and stanched an 8-0 Hawaii run. The damage, however, was done. The Gauchos never led again, or even managed to trim the lead down to two.† UCSB's shooting numbers fell off a cliff to 36% in the second half, while Hawai'i's stayed stable at 50%. Heidegger was the lone bright spot for the Gauchos with 15 points in the second half, giving him a game-high 21 overall, but his teammates were only able to muster up 13 points combined in the last 20 minutes.† Futile as it was, Heidegger's offensive performance was a promising sign for UCSB. Saturday's game was the senior's second since returning from a 10-game absence and was an impressive return to form. The Rainbow Warriors, on the other hand, pulled ahead with a balanced attack that saw four players score at least 6 points, but no player scored more than 8 points in the second half. Hawai'i's balance held true all game: junior guard Drew Buggs led the team with 12 points, but three other players scored at least 10. Buggs also played the role of facilitator on Saturday and played it masterfully. The junior dished out 12 assists against just 2 turnovers, a sterling ratio for any point guard.† The Gauchos, meanwhile, struggled to distribute the ball. The UCSB team combined for 3 assists, their lowest total of the season and just the third time they've finished with less than 10 assists in a game this season.† Hawai'i also outrebounded the Gauchos, 33 to 23, on Saturday. Nine of those Rainbow Warrior rebounds were on the offensive glass, compared to just 2 for the Gauchos, giving the hosts a 10-4 advantage in second-chance points.† Sophomore big man Amadou Sow is typically UCSB's go-to man on the glass, but he was limited to just over 18 minutes by foul trouble. Sow picked up 2 fouls in both halves, which forced Gaucho head coach Joe Pasternack to rely more heavily on the back up Idehen. Saturday's loss was two in a row for the Gauchos, who have struggled offensively in Big West play. The struggle hasn't been consistent from game to game, as UCSB shot reasonably well but turned the ball over 17 times in the team's loss to Long Beach State last week, complicating efforts to find a panacea for the team. A panacea might be hard to find, but the Gauchos will need to find some sort of patch as Big West play continues if they want to contend. UCSB hosts CSUN on Wednesday night and then UC Riverside on Saturday, two teams above the Gauchos in the conference standings.

sports,Gauchos Host Matadors Looking to Limit Diane,21-Jan-20,8:33 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-21/gauchos-host-matadors-looking-to-limit-diane/," The recipe for beating Cal State Northridge begins and ends with keeping superstar sophomore forward Lamine Diane quiet. It's not an easy recipe to follow, but it involves attacking him on offense. The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team will have its hands full on Wednesday night when Diane and the CSUN team visit the Thunderdome for a Big West showdown. Diane is averaging 27.4 points and 10.9 rebounds per game this season and has earned Big West Player of the Year honors and a spot on the AP All-American Honorable Mention team last season. ""úI don't think anybody can stop [Diane],""ù UCSB head coach Joe Pasternack said. ""ú He's the best college player I've ever scouted.""ù † Diane missed the first 12 games of this season due to academic issues and CSUN went 2-10 in his absence. Since the sophomore returned, the Matadors are 5-3, with a 2-2 record in the Big West.† One of those conference losses came at the hands of Cal Poly, which has otherwise struggled in Big West play so far. The Mustangs managed to hold Lamine to just 12 points and blew the Matadors out 74-56.† Not only did Cal Poly limit Diane to just 12 points on 45% shooting, they also limited him to 26 minutes of action. The forward fouled out with nine and a half minutes to go in the second half thanks to 4 fouls in the second half alone. Foul trouble has been a trend all season for Diane and especially in the last four games of Big West action. If the Gauchos can get Diane into foul trouble and on the bench, they'll be facing a severely weakened Matador team. Of course, stopping Diane and the CSUN offense will also require success on the defensive side. To that end, Pasternack plans to rely on a wide array of players and strategies. ""úWe're going to have a multitude of guys guarding [Diane],""ù Pasternack said. ""úFrom guards to forwards to centers.""ù The UCSB defense can't sell out to stop Diane entirely, however. The Matadors also boast sophomore guard Terrell Gomez, who's averaging 20.9 points per game and knocking down 41% of his 3-pointers. ""úGomez is just as dangerous as [Diane],""ù Pasternack said. ""úHe's a terrific player and we're gonna have to do a really, really great job because they have two all-leaguers, two guys going for player of the year.""ù On the offensive end, the Gauchos will be trying to shake off their recent malaise. UCSB has scored under 70 points in each of its last three games, including a 63-point performance in a loss to Hawai'i on Saturday that saw the team shoot just 36% in the second half. The Gauchos struggled to get the ball moving in Saturday's game and finished with only3 assists as a team. Ball movement, accordingly, has been a point of emphasis in practice leading into Wednesday night. ""úWe have to share the ball,""ù Pasternack said. ""úWe have to do a better job of not taking the easy shot, but really working the ball around.""ù Senior guard Max Heidegger has slowly been working himself back into form after a 10-game absence, and if his 21 points on Saturday are any indication, that process is going well. With Heidegger back and bombing away from the outside, the Gauchos are hoping things will open up down low for their big men. The team will also be relying on those big men to pick up their production on the glass. ""úWe got away from our team identity, rebounding, against Hawai'i,""ù Pasternack said. ""úWe were -10, which is the worst we've been this year. We're 11-1 when we outrebound our opponents so that's what we've got to focus on.""ù In order to get back to their identity on the glass, the Gauchos will have to contend with Diane, CSUN's leading rebounder. If UCSB can get the forward in foul trouble and off the court, those odds will improve. UCSB hosts CSUN on Wednesday night in the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. Comments are closed.

sports,Gauchos Take on Aggies & Titans in Crucial Week,23-Jan-20,5:09 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/gauchos-take-on-aggies-titans-in-crucial-week/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus After knocking off Irvine and narrowly falling to Riverside last week, the UCSB women's basketball team finds itself in a four-way tie for fourth place in the Big West conference at 2-2. This week, the Gauchos have their most difficult week to date, hosting UC Davis (7-9, 2-1) before traveling down to Fullerton for a rematch with the Titans (10-7, 2-2). Against two of the strongest teams in the conference, UCSB will need to do a better job of starting the game on the front foot. In Thursday's game against Irvine, the ""òChos needed a 27-point fourth quarter ""î including 17 points in the quarter from freshman phenom Ila Lane ""î to knock off an upstart Anteaters squad. Similarly, Santa Barbara trailed by nine at the end of the first quarter against the Highlanders. While the team never gave up, they were ultimately unable to overcome the early deficit, falling 66-61 to Riverside. With reigning conference champion UC Davis coming to town on Thursday, the Gauchos cannot afford to stumble out of the gate. After dropping a close game to Riverside, the Aggies have won their last two conference games, knocking off both Hawai'i and Long Beach State. Despite the graduation of superstar Morgan Bertsch ""î who accounted for 23.6 points per game last season ""î Davis seems to have hit its stride as of late. Earlier this season, UCD actually led at halftime against Stanford, the No. 4 team in the nation at the time. Much of UC Davis' success this season has been predicated on their free-flowing offense. Junior point guard Mackenzie Trpcic has done an excellent job orchestrating the offense, averaging 4.8 assists per game while only turning the ball over 2.3 times per game. ""úThey are always a tough team because they play very consistently and their offense has a lot of motion to it,""ù third-year Mira Shulman said. In terms of scoring production, the Aggies are relatively balanced with no single player averaging more than 29 minutes per game. Junior guard Katie Toole leads the way with 15.2 points per game; perhaps most impressively, she has done so while shooting 54% from the floor and 53% from deep. As a team, Davis thrives on its efficiency, shooting 42% from the floor and 37% from deep. ""úTheir [efficiency] makes packing in the paint hard, so we are going to need a lot of ball pressure to try to stop the ball from coming in on back door cuts and screens,""ù Shulman said. Many of UCD's weaknesses come on the defensive side of the court, where the Aggies allow 67 points per game. If the Gauchos are going to hang with Davis, they will need their offense to be in full swing on Thursday. With Davis lacking a dominant big, look for UCSB to lean on Lane for much of its offensive production. Lane continues to dominate in the post, averaging 14.1 points per game to go along with her monstrous 12.8 rebounds per game. On Saturday, Santa Barbara will travel to Fullerton looking to avenge their overtime loss earlier this season. Just like that game, UCSB's success will be predicated on its ability to slow down third-year guards Raina Perez and Taylor Turney ""î both of whom finished with more than 20 points in that first encounter. ""úTurney and Perez are who they are ""î they are two phenomenal playmakers in this league,""ù Henrickson said. In that game, Santa Barbara will need junior Danae Miller and senior Coco Miller to score from the perimeter. In the second half of the first meeting between the two sides, Fullerton was able to shut down Lane's presence inside by constantly double and triple-teaming her. With the Titans likely to keep a similar strategy, the Gauchos will need to hit their outside shots to keep pace on Saturday. In one of their most important weeks of the season, the Gauchos will host Davis at the Thunderdome at 7 p.m. Thursday, before hitting the road and taking on Fullerton Saturday at 5 p.m.†

sports,Men's Tennis Heads South Searching for First Win,23-Jan-20,5:00 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/mens-tennis-heads-south-searching-for-first-win/,"Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus Rolling in with a handful of Big West titles, a couple of nationally ranked players and standout new recruits, the UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team had little reason to begin the 2019-20 season anything less than confidently. Now, with two losses in their first two games, the Gauchos will look to redeem themselves against Santa Clara (0-2) in this weekend's tournament. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara started the new year dropping matches against Oregon and Washington. Just this past Monday, the team went down 3-4 to University of Washington, a loss which was albeit an improvement over their initial 0-4 loss to Oregon over the weekend.† Santa Clara, like Santa Barbara, has yet to post a win since the new year. Against Pepperdine, the team was unable to take control of a single match, resulting in a 5-0 sweep for the undefeated Waves. In their next game versus Loyola Marymount University, sophomore Santiago Hinojosa and freshman Mann Shah supplied Santa Clara's only two victories. Here, Shah took control of the fourth court, swiping a win away from his opponent with clean, back-to-back 6-1 victories. It is possible that after suffering losses on the road, each team is missing the comfort and advantage of their home courts. The NCAA Kick Off Weekend National Indoors tournament will continue to test the two programs as both Santa Clara and Santa Barbara head to Los Angeles to face one another. A much-needed Gaucho victory, however, will undoubtedly require some recalibration. In light of the inevitable loss of dominant alumni like All-American Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm, Head Coach Marty Davis prospectively sought out ways to readjust the roster heading into the new season.† He successfully snatched New York-based freshman Joshua Williams, a promising four-star recruit with regional and national recognition among the tennis community. On the other hand, junior Amit Batta, a transfer out of University of Washington, is adding his D1 collegiate experience to the roster. Texas A&M transfer Alejandro Vedri also joined the lineup, already earning game time in the early season.† In the Gauchos' first games of 2020, however, Coach Davis tapped into the depths of his returning roster. The integration of sophomores like Luka Vukmanovic and Wilhelm Saiga, each of whom hardly saw the courts last season, perhaps demonstrates Davis's attempts to configure a new and dynamic starting lineup. Vukmanovic and Saiga each contributed wins in their respective doubles and singles matches despite the greater team's defeat. In singles, Saiga took three sets to take down his Washington opponent to close out the unfruitful day. Vukmanovic, paired with senior Alex Soto on court three, beat Saiga's same opponent in the second match of the day.† Trusted players like Joseph Guillin and Joseph Rotheram fell short to dominant players on opposing rosters. In doubles play, Davis has so far partnered Guillin with Vedri, a switch from last year's play in which the Frenchman predominantly doubled with junior Victor Krustev. The present pair has produced mixed results, being defeated while in Oregon but coming out victorious in a 6-4 competition in Washington.† However, it is imperative not to undermine the fact that Guillin invariably shines among fellow nationally ranked collegiate players and that it seems that Santa Clara does not statistically have an equivalent.† Nonetheless, the Broncos' Hinojosa has kept up a strong and steadfast presence over his two years in the Bay. Hinojosa spent his freshman year dominating court six, finishing his singles season with only one loss and going 11-1. So far, Hinojosa has produced one of just two match wins since 2020 for his team.† Determined to finally tally a victory onto their record, UCSB and Santa Clara will compete this Saturday at 10 a.m., and viewers can tune in live to stream the game online.†

sports,No. 3 UCSB Men's Volleyball Travels North To Face No. 8 Stanford,23-Jan-20,1:03 PM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/no-3-ucsb-mens-volleyball-travels-north-to-face-no-8-stanford/," The No. 3 UCSB men's volleyball team travels to Palo Alto this Saturday to face off against No. 8 Stanford. UCSB couldn't have asked for a better start to their season, sweeping every opponent they have gone up against, securing a 5-0 record. Unfortunately for Santa Barbara, they have their toughest road stretch ahead of them. That stretch includes the big game at No. 8 Stanford, games on back-to-back days at No. 2 BYU and finally a battle in Ohio against Ohio State.† The beginning of this long and trying stretch for UCSB begins with a match against No. 8 Stanford, who has had an interesting start to their season. They have played well at home, going 2-0, but have picked up two tough road losses: one at the hand of Saint Francis University (2-3) and one against No. 7 UC Irvine (1-3). Stanford has several talented players, but there is one who UCSB should really look out for: freshman outside hitter Will Rottman, who has been a recurring problem for multiple teams this season. The first-year player, born and raised in Santa Barbara, has started his college career on a high note. He is third on the team in kills with 54 and ranks near the top on hitting percentage, despite his young age. There may also be a little extra motivation for Rottman in that he's going up against his hometown team and his father's alma mater (where he also played volleyball).† Even with the questionable losses this year, UCSB should not underestimate Stanford. They are one of those teams in collegiate men's volleyball who are usually playing for something important near the end of the season. The Gauchos will need to be on their A-game if they want to steal a road win on Saturday.† UCSB has been playing to that standard, playing at a very high level to start the year. They have been extremely efficient, posting an unreal 41% hitting percentage through their first five matches. This offensive success is due to a multitude of things, but for starters, great setting. Senior setter Casey McGarry has been the main catalyst for this high powered offense, picking up 30 or more assists in his last four matches. His impressive setting earned him Off the Block Setter of the Week honors. If he can keep playing at a high level, UCSB's chance of winning increases significantly. †Along with McGarry, several other Gauchos have been shining early in this 2020 season. Senior setter Randy DeWeese has been one of the bright spots for UCSB, scoring at a much higher clip compared to his first three seasons. His career kills per set average has increased significantly this year, going from a previous 0.37 kills per set to now being at 3.13 kills/set. Perhaps this is a new role for DeWeese in the Gauchos' high-octane offense. This is the second year in a row that UCSB has begun its season 5-0; a testament to their good coaching as well as a consistent winning culture around UC Santa Barbara. A road win against a strong opponent like Stanford would be huge for UCSB's confidence next week when they travel to BYU. In contrast, Stanford hopes to get back to their winning ways in front of their home crowd. I envision close matches down to the last set; however, I think UCSB will walk away victorious in this one, 3-2.†

sports,No. 9 UCSB Looking for Revenge at Michigan Invite,23-Jan-20,4:08 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-23/no-9-ucsb-looking-for-revenge-at-michigan-invite/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus After a good start to the season which included a surprising win over then-No. 2 UCLA and narrow losses to No. 6 Cal and No. 7 Michigan, the No. 9 UC Santa Barbara women's water polo team will travel to Ann Arbor this weekend for the Michigan Invite.† The Gauchos will play four games in their mini Midwest road trip.They will kick things off with a Saturday doubleheader against No. 23 Indiana and No. 24 Marist, in that order, before playing both No. 21 Wagner and No. 7 Michigan on Sunday. UCSB will be looking to maintain their form following a 19-2 thrashing of Ottawa University-Arizona in their last game. Freshmen Courtney Heydorff, Alex Mora and Evie Laptin combined scored 10 of the 19 points, a great sign for a team that will be relying on its youth more and more as the season wears on. Indiana will be playing their first match of the season against the Gauchos on Saturday, and although the team is nationally ranked, they are coming off of a rough 2018-19 season. The Hoosiers went 6-17 last season and weren't really close to doing any damage in the postseason, losing both matches in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament by double digits. Their best win from last year was actually their first game when they took down No. 15 UCSD by 8-7 at Campus Pool in Santa Barbara, so UCSB definitely can't take this team lightly. The key to this game for the Gauchos will be limiting Hoosier sophomore Tina Doherty's time of possession.† The attacker had a phenomenal freshman campaign last year, leading Indiana in goals (42) and total points (61) while also finishing second on the team in assists (19). UCSB will have their best chance of winning through limiting her scoring opportunities and forcing her supporting cast to make plays, so look for all eyes to be on her whenever the Hoosiers have possession. Next up on Saturday for UCSB will be the Marist College Red Foxes. The Red Foxes have lost all three of their games so far this season, although their strength of schedule has been strong with all matchups being against top-15 teams. Marist made it all the way to their conference championship last year but ultimately fell to Wagner, and the team lost some key players in the off-season including Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) Defensive Player of the Year Susan Cantoni who graduated. Even with these huge shifts to the roster, they certainly will be hungry for their first win when they compete against the ""òChos on Saturday.† UCSB will face off against reigning MAAC champions Wagner College on Sunday in the first of what will be two tough games. The Seahawks haven't played a match yet this year, but they are fresh off a 30-10 championship season that ended with an 8-12 loss to UCSD in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. This is one of the most lethal offensive teams in the country, spearheaded by MAAC Preseason Co-Player of the Year Sofia Diaz Alvarez. The Spanish attacker had an astounding freshman season, pouring in a team-leading 109 goals en route to a MAAC Rookie of the Year award. With the graduation of her teammate and former MAAC Player of the Year Erica Hardy, Diaz Alvarez will be stepping into an even bigger role in her sophomore season. The Gauchos will have to shut off her production if they want to beat this solid Red Fox team. The last game of the weekend for UCSB will be a rematch against host University of Michigan. The Wolverines beat the Gauchos 9-7 this past Sunday at the UCSB Winter Invite in a hotly contested match that came down to the last minute.† One of the keys to this game for the Gauchos will be limiting costly mistakes. They only converted one of their four penalty shots the last time these two teams met up which is just not going to cut it against the top-tier teams.† UCSB will have a great chance for revenge on Sunday, but they'll have to be on their A-game if they want to take down the No. 7-ranked Wolverines.† The games against Indiana and Marist are at 5 a.m. and 8:45 a.m., respectively, on Saturday morning, while Sunday's games against Wagner and Michigan start at 5 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. on Jan. 26.

sports,"Gauchos Shoot 28% From the Floor, Fall to Aggies",26-Jan-20,3:46 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-26/gauchos-shoot-28-from-the-floor-fall-to-aggies/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Streaky shooting doomed the UCSB women's basketball team on Thursday, as the Gauchos fell 56-46 to UC Davis. With the loss, the ""òChos fall to seventh in the Big West with a 2-3 conference record, while the Aggies catapult to second place with their 4-1 record in conference play. From the get-go, UCSB struggled with their shooting stroke against a tenacious zone defense from Davis. In the first quarter, Santa Barbara only shot 23.1% from the floor en-route to a 9-point quarter. With the Aggies throwing numbers at freshman Ila Lane in the post, UCSB was forced to lean on its perimeter offense, which struggled to get going for most of the night. In total, the Gauchos made only 5 of their 24 three-point attempts on the night. ""úYou have to be able to score, to knock down open shots,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úI didn't feel like we had any rhythm tonight. We got some good looks, but we couldn't knock them down.""ù While Lane was able to get going a bit in the second quarter ""î scoring 6 of her 12 points of the night during that quarter ""î Davis made a concerted effort in the second half to limit her touches in the post. Despite a gaudy 12-point, 14-rebound box score, Lane was largely stymied by UCD's defensive approach on Thursday. Despite the Gauchos' cold shooting for much of the game, their defensive effort kept the game close for much of the night. Even though the team shot 28.2% from the floor in the first half, they only trailed by five at the half, 26-21. The third quarter proved to be UCSB's Achilles' heel however. Davis opened the quarter on an 11-2 run ""î including a back-breaking 3-pointer from sophomore center Sage Stobbart, who the Gauchos opted not to guard on the perimeter. For her part, Stobbart put in one of her finest performances of the season on Thursday, finishing the game with 8 points and 10 rebounds despite the unenviable task of matching up with Lane. UCSB did its best to chip away at Davis' lead in the fourth quarter, but the damage had already been done. To open the quarter, senior guard Coco Miller hit 2 deep 3-pointers to bring the ""òChos within six. Despite an uneven night from behind the arc, Miller's range proved to be one of Santa Barbara's only viable weapons against the Aggies' zone defense, finishing the game with 12 total points and three 3-pointers. Nonetheless, every time the Gauchos seemed to threaten them, senior guard Katie Toole seemed to make a key basket to keep the ""òChos at bay. Just as she has done all season, Toole quietly impressed on Thursday, using her smooth mid-range jumper and shiftiness in the paint to lead UC Davis with 18 points on 8-14 shooting ""î including a team-high 5 points in the fourth quarter. In addition, Davis dominated Santa Barbara on the glass, outrebounding them 46-38. On a night where neither team shot the ball particularly well, that proved to be the difference. ""úWe defended the 3-point line well, but we gave up 18 offensive rebounds,""ù Henrickson said. ""ú It was the second-effort play and the second-chance points that killed us.""ù

sports,No. 3 UCSB Extends Win Streak With Sweep Of No. 8 Stanford,27-Jan-20,1:38 PM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/no-3-ucsb-extends-win-streak-with-sweep-of-no-8-stanford/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The No. 3 UC Santa Barbara men's volleyball team had a record-breaking weekend after defeating No. 8 Stanford by 3-0 on Saturday. The Gauchos were challenged with their first true road match of the year as they traveled north to take on the Cardinal.  They came into this one with a perfect 5-0 record, having picked up victories in 15 straight sets. UCSB would proceed to extend their impressive set winning streak to 18 after another dominating performance. This is the first time in program history that UCSB has started its season with 18 straight, a truly remarkable achievement. Although UCSB swept Stanford, the sets were still rather close. The first of the three sets was all about runs. The Gauchos came out strong, securing a 12-5 lead. But Stanford would respond by rallying off a series of kills, reducing their deficit to 11-14. However, UCSB would find their rhythm midway through the set and begin to take over. Senior Roy McFarland struck often for the Gauchos during this game. He had a big day, racking up 9 kills in the match. UCSB successfully took the first set 25-21.† The second set was probably the most back and forth of them all. The teams traded kills until the score became tied up at 14. That's when UCSB's defense began to take over. Their defense, led by senior Keenan Sanders, who had 5 block assists, and McFarland, who finished with 8 digs, helped fuel an 11-4 UCSB run. From that point on, it was just too much Santa Barbara for the Cardinal, as the Gauchos took the second set 25-18. The third and final set was similar to the first two. Things were close early on before UCSB's cohesive and united style of play began to dominate over the Cardinal's. Senior setter Casey McGarry had another big game, racking up 33 assists in the match and extending his impressive streak to six straight games with 30+ assists. The Gauchos took the third and final set 25-18, securing their sixth straight victory of the season.† UCSB has a week off before taking on their next biggest challenge of the season. This Friday and Saturday, Santa Barbara will travel to Utah to take on No. 2 Brigham Young University (BYU) in games on back-to-back nights. A series of wins here would be huge for UCSB giventhe men's volleyball national rankings. If that were to happen, these teams would most likely flip-flop in their rankings. What a moment it would be for small-town UC Santa Barbara to be the No. 2 team in the country.† UCSB can't underestimate BYU, as they have several notable weapons. The 6-foot-9-inch outside hitter Davide Gardini has 126 kills on the season and could cause some problems for UCSB's defense. Also, Gabi Garcia Fernandez is a 6-foot-7-inch opposite who has been very productive this year for BYU, racking up 123 kills so far. If UCSB can slow down either of these standout hitters ""î a tough task for that Gaucho defense ""î their chances of success will increase significantly. I think UCSB will continue to ride this impressive streak they are on right now and take down BYU on the road. Both of the games tip off at 7 p.m. MST in Utah this Friday and Saturday. Go Gauchos!

sports,"Offense Propels ""òChos to Victory Over Fullerton",27-Jan-20,2:21 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-27/offense-propels-chos-to-victory-over-fullerton/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus † Behind one of their best offensive performances of the season, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team picked up a crucial road victory, knocking off Cal State Fullerton by 75-66 on Saturday. With the victory, the Gauchos have moved to 3-3 in the conference, overtaking CSUF ""î which fell to 2-3 with the loss. In addition, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson picked up her 400th career victory. ""úIt's great, but of course it's more about getting our third conference win, a road win and a payback game for all the right reasons,""ù Henrickson said. After a less-than-spectacular offensive display on Thursday against Davis, UCSB scored their second-most points in a game this season on Saturday. In large part, that improvement can be attributed to the ""òChos' efficient performance on the floor, with the Gauchos shooting 46.4% on the night after shooting only 28.1% on Thursday. From the get-go, UCSB came out with a far more aggressive tone than it set against the Aggies. On the first possession, junior forward Mira Shulman ""î in her first-ever start ""î drove hard into the paint, finishing over two Titan defenders to give Santa Barbara a lead it would notrelinquish for the rest of the game. The insertion of Shulman into the starting lineup seemed to ignite a fire within UCSB ""î especially among the bench. In total, the ""òChos' bench outscored the Titans' bench by 34-14 on Saturday, with senior Tal Sahar, freshman Johnni Gonzalez and sophomore Megan Ormiston all turning in fantastic performances. Despite a rough shooting performance against Davis, Sahar provided some much-needed spacing off the bench, hitting 50% of her 3-pointers en-route to a 12-point game. Gonzalez too seemed to discover her stroke off the bench, making all of her shots and finishing with 9 points. But perhaps the most important performance came from Ormiston, who was forced to play heavy minutes with freshman Ila Lane in foul trouble for most of the night. In 22 minutes, Ormiston finished with 13 points on 86% shooting and 5 rebounds ""î easily her best performance of the season. Ormiston's presence in the paint also played a large role in the Gauchos' domination of the Titans on the boards. On the night, UCSB outrebounded CSUF 42-23, with Lane leading the way with 14 rebounds in only 18 minutes. Crucially, those rebounds led to 21 second-chance points for the Gauchos ""î compared to only 2 for Fullerton. Defensively, the ""òChos did a good job of limiting CSUF's dynamic duo: junior guards Taylor Turney and Raina Perez. After allowing the duo to score 43 combined points in the first matchup between these teams, UCSB held them to 27 combined points this time around. With the Gauchos' defense keying in on the two stars, Perez merely went 5-13 from the floor, while Turney went 6-15. This win serves as revenge for the previous matchup between these two teams, which ended in a 70-68 Fullerton victory in overtime. Next, UCSB must turn their attention back to UC Davis ""î the team that beat them just this past Thursday. The Gauchos will hope they can get revenge once again in that game against a balanced Davis team. UCSB will take on Davis this Saturday at 2:30 p.m.† Comments are closed.

sports,UCSB Picks up First Victory in ITA Kickoff Weekend Tourney,28-Jan-20,10:06 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-28/ucsb-picks-up-first-victory-in-ita-kickoff-weekend-tourney/,"Chasing the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus After a narrow 4-3 loss to Santa Clara (1-3) on Saturday, the UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team found itself scrounging for a win in the consolation round of last weekend's tournament. Luckily, Sunday's game ended their long drought, as they finished the ITA Kickoff Weekend tournament with a striking 4-1 victory over UNCW (0-3). Though relieved, UCSB's overall record sits at 1-3, arguably one of the program's toughest starts to a season.† Santa Clara and UNCW, like UCSB, came into the tournament with no notches on their 2020 belts. Both teams suffered disappointing, yet probably unsurprising, 0-4 blowouts versus No. 3 USC.† UCSB gracefully evaded USC's forceful hand, allowing for a much-needed win and, more specifically, a chance to prove that its roster has not lost its competitive edge.† Throughout both games and across the six courts, the Gauchos dominated the singles competitions. Out of four victories, not even one winning Gaucho let his matches slip to a third game. Senior Joseph Guillin defended his No. 8 national ranking, sweeping his opponents on each team in 6-2, 6-0 sets. Teammate Victor Krustev followed suit on court two.† Against Santa Clara, the Gauchos split their singles victories evenly at 3-3. But without the same energy on the doubles courts, the wins were insufficient to pull ahead. Standout Bronco Santiago Hinojosa reinforced his strong presence on court four, defeating fourth-year Gaucho Alex Soto in singles and doubles competitions. Against UNCW, however, the dominance exhibited in the solo matches allowed UCSB to walk away with an important win. A nod to freshman Joshua Williams is in store after his win on court six cinched his team's first victory of the season. The rookie tallied the first win of his collegiate career, taking a UNCW senior in just two sets. Williams struck quickly in the first set, slating a 6-1 triumph, but was challenged by veteran opponent Michael Copeland, who battled up to the 7th point before falling 7-5.† As previously mentioned, it was in the doubles department that UCSB seemed to lose its footing. In the six total doubles matches played over the weekend, only two wins emerged.† As has been a pattern of the 2020 season, Head Coach Marty Davis paired sophomore transfer Alejandro Vedri with standout Guillin. The fresh pair responded with two clean sweeps against Santa Clara and UNCW. Together they have been a strong force, reflected in their 3-1 overall record since the start of 2020.††† However, it seems Guillin's former partner, Krustev, is struggling to get a solid rhythm with his new partner, junior Joseph Rotheram. Though each contributed points to the Gauchos' totals in singles competitions this weekend, the duo failed to secure a win on court one against both Santa Clara and UNCW. The scores played out at 7-6 (8-6) and 7-6 (7-4), respectively. Rotheram and Krustev began the season with back-to-back, impressive (yet unfinished) matches against Oregon and Washington.† The two, along with the rest of the roster, hope to continue to readjust and refine their play for the upcoming season. The Gauchos now head back up the coast in preparation for Saturday's game against Loyola Marymount University.† Comments are closed.

sports,Alum Recounts How Kobe Brought Purple & Gold Euphoria to UCSB,30-Jan-20,6:02 AM,['Jonathan Neal'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/alum-recounts-how-kobe-brought-purple-gold-euphoria-to-ucsb/,"Sam Rankin / The Daily Nexus My experience as a student at UC Santa Barbara was full of sweet excitement, stunning beauty, a rigorous education, lifelong friends, ridiculous fun and a feeling that my youth would never end. Of all of my experiences as a Gaucho, some of my most thrilling were when Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers came to UCSB in October of 1999 and deeply and visibly engaged the campus community into a magical wave of purple and gold euphoria. It was extremely exciting when the Lakers announced that they would return to UCSB for their training camp. They had been there the prior season, but I had been too engrossed in midterms to participate (they were there in February of 1999 ""î a strange time for NBA training camp ""î due to a strike-shortened season). This time, the Lakers would be on campus from early to mid-October, right after the school year started. Perfect! No need for much studying.† The Lakers conducted their practices at Rob Gym.† Being a lifelong, die-hard Lakers fan, I was determined to connect with the players, and I had the two necessary items that would help me accomplish this. The prior summer, I had bought a gold Shaq jersey, and I had also just purchased what remains my most prized possession ""î a Sector 9 longboard that I still skate with in 2020.† I decided that I was going to get as many Lakers as possible to sign my jersey. To achieve this goal, I decided to use the skateboard to my advantage. I figured out that I could place my jersey on top of the longboard and hand the entire board to the players I wanted to sign my jersey.† That way, it took up a lot of space in their field of vision and it would be harder to refuse. One afternoon during the training camp, I stood at the exit to Rob Gym where the players would pass as they got onto their bus. The players began exiting the building. First, Shaq signed nothing as he passed, saying with pomp: ""úI'm not signing anything.""ù It's all good. He wasn't the one I wanted anyway. Lots of other players signed autographs though. I handed my skateboard to five players who signed my jersey: Robert Horry, Tyronn Lue, Derek Fisher, Glen Rice and one Kobe Bryant. For the last 21 years, I've been skating on my board, loving that Kobe held it.† After a few minutes, all the Lakers got on the bus ""î except Kobe. Kobe kept signing and signing, with a smile. Finally, the bus with the players on it started honking at him! He just ignored the honking. He kept signing away outside of Rob Gym, again, with a smile on his face. He was doing what he wanted to do ""î making the fans happy ""î regardless of his teammates' wishes.  Once Kobe got on the bus and the Lakers departed, my jaw dropped as I realized that I had hit the mother lode ""î I was standing there next to Rob Gym with a bright gold Lakers jersey with the signatures of five players, including one superstar. Photo courtesy of Jonathan Neal My time interacting with the Lakers was not through, however. At the end of camp, the Lakers held a free intrasquad scrimmage for the UCSB community at the Thunderdome.† In Phil Jackson's book, ""úMore Than a Game,""ù he discusses this public practice, stating ""úwe were certainly well hosted in Santa Barbara.""ù Jackson also refers to UCSB as ""úone of the most beautiful college campuses in the country.""ù Right outside the Thunderdome, the Lakers showed up in front of a handful of fans, and walked into the arena basically in a line. I asked Phil Jackson for an autograph (even calling him Mr. Jackson) but he told me that he had to start practice. Fair enough. The last player who passed? A certain Kobe Bean Bryant. I called to him. ""úKobe!""ù He turned his head toward me: ""úYes.""ù ""úCan I get my picture taken with you?""ù ""úSure,""ù he said. He walked the 15 feet or so from the entrance of the building to where I was standing. Let me point out that this was in the pre-digital camera era. I didn't even own a camera. Before I showed up to the T-Dome, I bought a disposable camera from the Isla Vista Market, just in case I got lucky, and as Kobe approached, I gave the camera to some random dude to take it, hoping that he wouldn't blow my chance for a souvenir for the ages. Kobe came up to me and wrapped his arm tightly around my shoulders, like I was his little brother. The disposable camera snapped. ""úThanks, man,""ù I said. ""úYou're welcome,""ù said the future Hall-of-Famer, Olympic gold medalist and five-time NBA world champion. I was in absolute nirvana. I was flying above the ground. It was a total exhilaration. I was dizzy. Kobe had shown himself to be, without a doubt, the most accessible Laker, the kindest one and the most devoted to his fans.† Photo courtesy of Jonathan Neal. Eventually, the Lakers meandered their way into the room, unannounced. There was big applause for all of the players. Except there was one player missing ""î the youngest player on the team. When Kobe nonchalantly entered the arena, there was a cacophony of ear-splitting applause, a standing ovation for the ages, one that put the thunder in the Thunderdome. The deafening ovation was even bigger than the crowd had given for superstar Shaquille O'Neal.† The scrimmage itself was delicious. It was the purple team against the gold team. For pure fans, how wonderful is it to see players on one's favorite team play one another? I wish I had more precise memories of the game, but I clearly was in the afterglow of my time with Kobe. I just remember being so happy. Feeling so lucky. To be at my beloved, beautiful university and to have the basketball team I had loved since I was 6 years old visit my campus and interact with me. The Los Angeles Lakers won the NBA Championship that season for the first time in 12 years. They clinched it exactly two days after I walked in my graduation ceremony on June 17, 2000. So two extremely meaningful and emotional life events for me happened within a week. The Lakers also won the championship the next year ""¶ and finished off the three-peat the following season. I want everyone reading this to remember this: The three-peat all started in Isla Vista. I spent half of my life watching Kobe dazzle and amaze. I always thought that he would be an ambassador for the Lakers and the NBA for the next 40 or 50 years. I am deeply sad. As I remember this story, I feel immense gratitude and love ""î for my magical and wonderful college experience at UCSB, for basketball, the Lakers and for Kobe Bryant. The experiences I'm recounting happened 20 years ago, but they feel like they went down yesterday.† My memories as a Gaucho are sweet and exhilarating. In the midst of my sorrow about the loss of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, my wonderful recollections from when Kobe and the Lakers came to campus are swirling in my mind. Thank you, Kobe, for being so kind and friendly to the fans, and, for the briefest of moments, making me feel like we were 21-year-old brothers.  Jonathan Neal graduated from UCSB in 2000 with majors in Business Economics and Political Science. He lives in Los Angeles and works in the film industry. Where's the photo????

sports,Gauchos Aim to Knock Off Undefeated Lions,30-Jan-20,5:32 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/gauchos-aim-to-knock-off-undefeated-lions/,"From the sheer force of running after the ball, Joseph Guillin's hat falls off. Siavash Ghadirir/Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team, a product of one of the university's most consistently dominant programs, has struggled this 2020 season to find that winning mojo which has defined them throughout these past years. Last weekend, the Gauchos ended a three-game dry spell and finally landed their first victory in a consolation-round closer against UNC Wilmington, pushing their record to 1-3. In what will be their fifth away game in a row, Santa Barbara heads back down the coast and to Westchester to face Loyola Marymount University. LMU, though only two games deep, boasts a spotless 2-0 record. In their 2020 season debut, the Lions defeated Santa Clara 5-2, a team who recently took down UCSB in a narrow 4-3 showdown.† Against SCU, Loyola Marymount saw solid performances from the top of its lineup. Across the first three courts, sophomore Keenan Mayo, junior Diego Nava and redshirt-junior Lucas Moreno (whose win clinched the team's victory) shut the door on their opponents in two sets each. Both Nava and Moreno walk into their respective match-ups with a clean 2-0 singles record. Their recent successes, however, perhaps give a misleading impression of the returners' consistency on the court. As of last season, neither Nava nor Moreno† ""î frequenters of courts 3 and 4 ""î had won more than six matches out of a minimum 14 games. In fact, the Lions' win percentage rounded out at around a mere 37%.† However, it would be naive to think that LMU's roster ""î or Santa Barbara's, for that matter ""î is static or that its lackluster performance last season will be repeated in this new decade. Already, LMU's head coach Tom Lloyd picked up Mayo, a University of Illinois transfer. The SoCal native carried out an impressive 12-16 collegiate debut, taking down strong nationally ranked competitors. And yet, the street goes both ways; at this point last year, UCSB was on its way to a .750 win percentage, so there is no doubt that this season has been one of realignment. Now predominantly juniors and sophomores ""î with a solid transfer and freshman stud interspersed into the mix ""î the Gaucho lineup has been doing its best to adjust its gameplay. Though it hasn't translated into wins, the team has shown some promising performances thus far. The past four games have especially shown the strength of the team in the singles competitions, a facet which must continue into Sunday's game. With exception to the season opener versus University of Oregon, the Gauchos have raked in at least two singles victories per game, totaling nine since the start. No. 8 senior Joseph Guillin and junior Victor Krustev each delivered two wins last weekend, backed up by prior wins from sophomore Wilhelm Saiga, sophomore Alejandro Vedri and a clinch by rookie freshman Joshua Williams.† That being said, the Gauchos' biggest shortcoming has been their performance on the doubles courts, reflected in a win-to-loss ratio below .500. Working to control the majority of doubles matches will be crucial for UCSB, as they have the opportunity to take advantage of LMU's top pairs who have so far delivered inconsistently. This may put pressure on number one duo Krustev and junior Joseph Rotheram who seem to still be finding their groove after leaving last weekend's tournament victory-less.† Aside from this, the only thing to wish for is that the Gauchos have finally turned a corner and that from here on out, the team finds consistency in their gameplay and relies on each other to deliver their best. UCSB takes on LMU on Sunday, Feb. 1 at 11 a.m. Comments are closed.

sports,Gauchos Take On First Place Aggies Looking for Revenge,30-Jan-20,6:38 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/gauchos-take-on-first-place-aggies-looking-for-revenge/,"Danae Miller moves the ball up the court. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus After six games of conference play last season, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team found itself in the cellar of the conference with a 1-5 record. Following the team's stellar offensive performance on the road against Cal State Fullerton, the Gauchos are firmly in the conference race, sitting in fifth place with a 3-3 conference record. If UCSB truly hopes to challenge for the regular season conference title, the team will need to knock off UC Davis on Saturday ""î who currently lead the conference with a 4-1 record in Big West play. Knocking off the Aggies on the road will be no easy task for the ""òChos, who just last Thursday fell 56-46 at home to Davis. Despite limiting Davis to its second lowest offensive tally in conference play, the Gauchos poor offensive display ultimately doomed the team. In that game, Santa Barbara merely shot 28.1% from the floor and only had three players score more than two points. Every time UCSB seemed to make a run in that game, senior guard Katie Toole would make a basket to ensure that Davis kept the lead. On the night, Toole paced the Aggies with 18 points on an efficient 8-14 from the floor. In the rematch, the ""òChos will have to try to keep Toole in check while not throwing too many numbers at her on defense. Davis features one of the most balanced offensive approaches in the conference ""î with no single player averaging more than 29 minutes per game. ""úDavis is always a tough team to play because they play very consistently and their offense has a lot of motion to it,""ù junior guard/forward Mira Shulman said. ""úThey also have a lot of people shooting a very high percentage, which makes packing in the paint hard.""ù At the end of the day, however, UCSB's success will come down to its ability to generate offense against a sturdy Aggies defense that has played lights out as of late. In the Aggies' road win over the weekend against Cal Poly, they held the Mustangs to 36 points on only 29.5% shooting from the floor. As has been the case all season, the ""òChos will surely look to get freshman Ila Lane involved early. A double-double machine, Lane was one of the few bright spots for UCSB in the first matchup between these sides, scoring 12 points and grabbing 14 boards. In the second half, however, the Aggies started to double-team Lane in the post, and limited her to only 5 second-half points. With Davis likely to employ a similar strategy on Saturday, UCSB will need their guard play to step up and carry the load on offense. While senior guard Coco Miller and junior point guard Danae Miller both finished with double figures in that matchup, they did so on inefficient splits, with Coco going 3-11 and Danae going 5-20 from the floor. If the Gauchos are to keep pace with Davis, they will need their bench to continue to provide an added scoring punch, taking some of the pressure off of Coco and Danae. Against Fullerton, the bench scored 34 total points ""î including double-digit performances from senior Tal Sahar and sophomore Megan Ormiston. Playing Davis away is never an easy matchup ""î especially given Davis' success this season in conference play already. Still, if the ""òChos can come up with a more efficient performance from the floor, they have the firepower necessary to keep pace with the Aggies. UCSB will take on UC Davis on Saturday at 2:30 p.m.

sports,No. 3 UCSB Set for Primetime Matchups Against No. 2 BYU,30-Jan-20,5:15 AM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/no-3-ucsb-set-for-primetime-matchups-against-no-2-byu/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara men's volleyball team travels to Utah this Friday for two games against Brigham Young University (BYU. These schools come into the week with two of the top volleyball programs in the country, with BYU at No. 2 and UCSB in the No. 3 spot. Santa Barbara (6-0) and BYU (8-0) have both been perfect to start the year, making this weekend's matchup even more exciting. Will one of these schools go to 2-0 on the weekend? Or could they split victories and see two of the remaining four unbeaten teams go down? UCSB has been playing great volleyball to start the 2020 season, sweeping every team they have gone up against. The competition hasn't been a walk in the park either, but Santa Barbara has just continuously risen to the occasion. Some of their notable victories this year include wins over No. 13 Concordia Irvine, No. 11 Purdue Fort Wayne, and over former No. 8 Stanford. Yes, this weekend's series of games will be Santa Barbara's biggest test to date; however, the Gauchos will definitely travel to BYU prepared and with the mindset that they can and should win this game. The proof of UCSB's great play this year is clearly evident in their statistics. The Gauchos currently hold the highest rank in the Big West Conference for kills per set, digs per set and assists per set. A large part of their offensive success this year is because of the play of senior setter Casey McGarry. McGarry just recently earned Off the Block National Setter of the Week honors for the second consecutive week for another impressive performance versus Stanford. He racked up another 30-plus assist match, his fifth time doing that in just six games this year. Luckily for McGarry, he has several talented offensive options he can target each time he takes the floor. Some of those targets include senior setter Randy DeWeese and senior outside hitter Roy McFarland. Both of these fourth-year players are currently leading the team in kills, with DeWeese at 56 and McFarland at 38. These two will need to be at the top of their games come this weekend if UCSB wants to steal a couple of road wins. UCSB won't underestimate BYU, as they have several notable weapons. The 6-foot-9-inch outside hitter Davide Gardini has 126 kills on the season and could cause some problems for UCSB's defense. Also, Gabi Garcia Fernandez is a 6-foot-7-inch opposite hitter who has been very productive this year for BYU, racking up 123 kills so far. If UCSB can slow down either of these standout hitters ""î a tough task for that Gaucho defense ""î their chances of success will increase significantly. I am interested to see what happens after this Friday night's game. Will adjustments be made by the losing team before Saturday's game and what will those adjustments be? Last year, UCSB traveled to BYU for the same back-to-back and came home with two 3-0 sweeps. With the way Santa Barbara has been playing to start the year, it is hard to bet against them. I think UCSB is going to pick up two huge wins in Utah and claim the No. 2 spot in the nation. If you want to watch the games, they both will be livestreamed on BYUtv.

sports,TV Time in Northridge: UCSB Set for Quick Rematch Against CSUN,30-Jan-20,5:45 AM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-01-30/tv-time-in-northridge-ucsb-set-for-quick-rematch-against-csun/,"Siavash Ghadiri / The Daily Nexus It'll be TV time in Northridge Thursday night when the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team tips off against Cal State University, Northridge in a match televised on ESPNU.† It's an 8 p.m. start time originally scheduled for 7 p.m., a change the Gauchos hope won't interfere with their rhythm. Four of their last five games have tipped off at 7 p.m., the road match against Hawai'i being the only game to have started at 8 p.m. (HST).† UCSB will come into this match winners of their first game since the road opener against Cal Poly. In last Saturday's Thunderdome throwdown against UC Riverside (UCR), the Gauchos climbed back from a game-long deficit to take their first lead at 54-53 with just 5:46 left to go. Senior guard Max Heidegger's 3-point dagger with 2.9 seconds left completed a comeback that was nothing short of great. With that basket, UCSB finished on top 65-63. For himself, Heidegger is amidst an inspiring three-game run of form in which he's averaged 19.3 points per game at a 55% clip. He's also dished out 2.6 helpers and is hitting 34% from deep. Of the past three games, Heidegger's best performance was coincidentally the last meeting between these teams. In that game, despite losing, he finished with 21 points, 2 rebounds and 5 assists, and tied for second in the game in points.† Head coach Joe Pasternack is surely appreciating the rejuvenation he's seen from his team since the introduction of the senior guard in the starting lineup. The main issue for the Gauchos seemed to be their efficiency from the floor, but Heidegger's 55% showing over the past three games suggests he may be the answer. He's one to watch in this Thursday's game.† UCSB's overall record hasn't translated well to conference play yet and now they find themselves up against a Cal State University, Northridge (CSUN) team that has already bested them once. The Matadors' 8-14 record goes to show that it ain't just a cliche that anybody can win these games.† In fairness to CSUN, they've played much better than their overall record suggests, which is why looking at their performances in the more recent games can tell us a bit more.† Matador sophomore forward Lamine Diane is on fire right now, having scored 32 and 27 points, respectively, in each of the past two games after having missed his team's matchup against UC Davis. Just prior to that, Diane led the way in CSUN's dominant victory over UCR, finishing with 36 points, 9 rebounds, 1 assist, 2 blocks and 3 steals. He'll be a tough one to stop, but it'll have to get done if the Gauchos are to steady the ship.† The Matadors have alternated wins and losses since their win over Long Beach State in the conference opener and sit at 3-3, in fifth-place in the Big West. Diane is flanked by junior guard Terrell Gomez out of Los Angeles, California. Gomez, a member of last year's All-Big West First Team, is bragging about his cover fire of 20.6 points per game.† He's actually seventh on his team in FG%, but he leads the way with 36.9 minutes per game and is consistently knocking down baskets night in and night out. He's also got a 93.5% clip from the line and still dishes out 2.5 helpers a game. Other notable information to highlight include that Gaucho sophomore forward Amadou Sow has scored in double figures in five of the past six games and looks set to shoot with a green light on Thursday.† Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin contributed, but struggled to have a more significant impact in the win over the Highlanders after sustaining a groin injury earlier in the week. Junior guard Brandon Cyrus, the probable replacement if McLaughlin needs a break, has made just 4 of his 20 shot attempts over the past four games. McLaughlin has averaged 14.8 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game with a 48.9% efficiency from the floor and will surely be missed if he is not fully recovered.† UCSB will travel to CSUN for a match that tips off at 8 p.m. this Thursday.

sports,Gauchos Score 55 Second-Half Points in Blowout Victory Over LBSU,4-Feb-20,4:14 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/gauchos-score-55-second-half-points-in-blowout-victory-over-lbsu/,"Angie Banks / Daily Nexus The last time the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team played Long Beach State, they lost thanks to one of the coldest shooting halves of the season. This time around, they couldn't miss. The Gauchos rode a 55-point second half to a 87-62 win over the Beach on Saturday. The team shot almost 60% from the field in the second half and went 6-11 on 3-pointers, all while holding LBSU to 35 points and 40% from the field in the half. Saturday's win moved UCSB to 14-8 this season and 3-4 in Big West play. Long Beach State fell to 7-16 and 2-5. Graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman was the standard bearer for UCSB's offensive explosion. Freeman finished with a season-high 24 points and seemed almost incapable of missing, going 9-11 on field goals and 6-7 on 3-pointers. Freeman had struggled offensively in the games leading up to Saturday. The former Oklahoma Sooner hadn't cracked double-digit points yet in 2020, but the turn of the calendar to February seemed to rejuvenate the stretch big . The only flaw of Freeman's game on Saturday was foul trouble, but even that was just a small roadblock. Limited to only six minutes in the second half, Freeman still managed to pour in 13 points on 5-5 shooting. The Gauchos hardly skipped a beat, even with Freeman's hot hand forced to take a seat. Senior guard Max Heidegger stepped up with 12 points and 7 assists in the second half and finished with a near triple-double of 14 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds. Sophomore big man Amadou Sow dominated the boards all game and finished with 14 total rebounds, 7 on offense and 7 on defense. Sow did most of his damage in the first half, but his presence inside helped open up opportunities for UCSB's shooters. The Gauchos helped their own case on offense by taking care of the ball better than they had all year. UCSB committed a season-low 8 turnovers and passed out 22 assists, tied for a season high. The ball movement, hot shooting, post presence and a 21-24 team performance at the free-throw line all contributed to the 87-point performance, the Gauchos' second-best scoring output this season. The 25-point margin of victory was UCSB's largest of the season, a credit to the defense. Long Beach State shot just 36.2% and committed 12 turnovers, which became 15 points for UCSB. The Beach didn't shoot much better the first time they clashed with UCSB, but the Gauchos were a paltry 32% on their field goal tries that first time around. It took UCSB over five minutes to crack double digits, and the two teams stayed more-or-less neck and neck throughout the first half, which ended with the Gauchos up 32-27. Both teams made just around a third of their shots, but Sow's rebounding and Freeman's shooting helped UCSB stay just ahead. The second half was the Matt Freeman show from the first possession. Freeman scored on four of the Gauchos' first six possessions and tallied 11 points in the first three and a half minutes of second-half action. The aforementioned foul trouble forced Freeman to the bench in short order, but the damage was done. UCSB opened up an 11-point lead in those three and a half minutes, and LBSU never managed to close the gap again. UCSB gets a few days off before hosting two games against the Big West's best next week. The first is a Thursday matchup against Hawaii at 7 p.m. and the second is a Saturday game against UC Irvine, also at 7 p.m.

sports,Men's Volleyball Suffers First Loss of the Season,4-Feb-20,12:03 PM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/mens-volleyball-suffers-first-loss-of-the-season/,"Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Over the past weekend, the UC Santa Barbara men's volleyball team traveled to Provo, Utah to take on No. 2 BYU on Friday and Saturday. UCSB came into the match winners of their first six games of the season, securing the No. 3 spot in the country. This heavyweight matchup featured some of the brightest and most talented athletes in the game right now. Both teams played extremely hard, but ultimately BYU just had too many weapons for UCSB to handle. BYU would win Friday's matchup 3-1 and Saturday's contest 3-2. Friday's game was the first time these two teams have met since last year's matchups, which UCSB took on the road and won 3-0 and 3-0. BYU most likely had these games in the back of their minds and used it to fuel an impressive showing. BYU came out swinging in Friday's match, connecting at a very high clip on attacking attempts. They would win the first set rather handily at 25-16.† However, Santa Barbara wouldn't just roll over. They would make key adjustments early on and respond in the second set. The Gauchos only hit .272 that day, but in the second frame they were able to connect at a higher rate. Senior setter Randy DeWeese led the way for UCSB, picking up 15 kills in the contest. BYU wasn't able to come back after suffering an early deficit, resulting in a 25-21 UCSB victory. After two sets, they were tied up at one set apiece. The third set was probably the closest back-and-forth of the game before some Santa Barbara errors opened up the game and allowed BYU to capitalize. The game was all locked up at 17-17 and looked like it could go either way before a series of serving mistakes killed SB's momentum. From that point on, BYU had strong control of the momentum with all the energy in the building fueling their play. They would take the third game 25-21.† The closeout set was a lot like the third one. The momentum had completely swung midway through the third set, and it didn't seem as though UCSB would be able to recover from that. BYU would close this series out with a 25-17 victory. UCSB wouldn't even have 24 hours to break down the game and make adjustments because they would play them again the following day! Saturday's contest would turn out to be more back-and-forth, turning into a battle that came down to the final set.† The first game was extremely competitive, both teams trading blows throughout. UCSB gained a slight advantage late in the set because of big kills by Roy McFarland and DeWeese, forcing a BYU timeout. Out of the timeout, the Gauchos were able to get a crucial stop and convert that into the closeout points of the game. Casey McGarry would be the offensive catalyst of the day, as he picked up one of his season-high† 53 assists on the last play of the set. UCSB would take the first set 25-23. The second set was also back and forth before UCSB's service errors hindered their chances of winning. Santa Barbara led BYU in every major stat category ""î hitting percentage, blocks and digs ""î but ultimately UCSB's serving miscues are what led to BYU's successes. BYU evened things up at one after taking the second set 25-22. UCSB would come out of the break playing their best volleyball. The Gaucho defense really stepped up in this set, holding BYU to an abysmal .094 hitting percentage in the set. The Gauchos would take this one easily, 25-20, securing a 2-1 lead on the road. The fourth set was just like the second. These powerhouses were neck and neck up until UCSB had game point off of a McFarland spike, one of his 15 kills in the match. With an opportunity to close the game out, service errors cost UCSB the win and forced a fifth and final set. This fourth set finished with BYU winning 28-26. The fifth set was a big struggle for UCSB. The momentum had swung yet again as the fans in Utah went crazy for their BYU Cougars. BYU rallied around one another to pick up their 10th victory of the year. They took the deciding set 15-11.† UCSB has a good opportunity in front of them ""î a chance to bounce back on the road against a strong opponent. The Gauchos fly to Ohio to take on Ohio State this Friday. The game's opening serve is at 4 p.m.

sports,UCSB Men's Tennis Splits Weekend Road Trip,4-Feb-20,11:48 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-04/ucsb-mens-tennis-splits-weekend-road-trip/,"Chasing the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus In a heated match on Saturday, the UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team secured their second win of the season, beating the previously undefeated Loyola Marymount 4-3 on their home court. However, the tables turned, and the streak was lost after the team suffered a 4-3 loss to Pepperdine, who came out of the match with a spotless record. These two games marked their fifth and sixth games on the road since the start of the dual-meet season, and the Gauchos' rocky 2-4 record seems to reflect that. Named Big West Men's Tennis Athlete of the Week in the days leading up to the weekend's matches, it seems only right to shout out sophomore Alejandro Vedri for his consistent dominance so far this season. The accolade recognized Vedri's winning records in singles and doubles competitions. With the exception of UCSB's scoreless loss to Oregon, the Spaniard has steadily contributed at least 1 point per match, both alone and with doubles partner Joseph Guillin. Saturday was no different. Vedri left the match against LMU unscathed, going undefeated in singles and doubles competitions. His solo win was the sixth and last of the singles for the day. His energy carried into the doubles sector, where he and Guillin tallied the team's only point versus LMU's Ethan Prost and Mayo Keenan with a 6-3 win on court two. However, Vedri's victory ride was cut short on Sunday, as the sophomore slipped to his competitor in the first singles match of the day. Freshman Joshua Williams played like a vet in Saturday's opening match, comfortably delivering a two-set 6-1, 6-2 victory, proving his ability to compete at the collegiate level; the next day, he was swiped by a fellow rookie. Junior Victor Krustev followed suit. Losing four of their six singles matches on Sunday, the Gauchos saw a small and unwelcome crack in their gameplay ""î one which had definitely not been present the day prior when they slammed four close-to-consecutive singles wins to ensure their overall victory. But alas, the Pepperdine game was not all dim and weary. On Sunday, the Gauchos finally saw two solid performances on the doubles courts, a sweet relief from what's been an otherwise frustrating pattern of the 2020 season. The most striking one came from Krustev and fellow junior Joseph Rotheram. The 6-2 victory on the first court was a long-awaited one, especially after losing on Saturday in a tie-breaker set which finished at 6-7, and we can only hope that this is just the beginning of something good for the Gauchos. The strong Guillin-Vedri pairing beat their Pepperdine opponents with an identical score directly after. In a perfect world, UCSB would be able to finally put these pieces together and rev up what has been such a slow start to the new decade; this upcoming week could be that perfect opportunity. In the presence of a local crowd and the comfort of their own court, the men's tennis team will hopefully capitalize on their first at-home game this season and continue to redirect their path when they take on Fresno State on Thursday.†

sports,Gauchos Take On Conference Leaders in Pivotal Week,6-Feb-20,6:08 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-06/gauchos-take-on-conference-leaders-in-pivotal-week/,"Devearl Ramsey pulling up for an open shot. Angie Banks / Daily Nexus After a rough start to Big West play, the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team seems to have turned things around. The Gauchos are 2-1 in their last three games, including a 25-point blowout of Long Beach State last Saturday. This week, however, they'll put their turnaround to the test. UCSB hosts the top two teams in the Big West this week, likely making this the toughest week of competition the Gauchos have faced this season. Hawai'i, second in the Big West with a 5-1 conference record and a 14-6 overall record, enters the Thunderdome on Thursday night while UC Irvine, top in the conference at 6-1 and 14-9, visits on Saturday. The Gauchos, meanwhile, are 14-8 this season and 3-4 in Big West play. Thursday's game is a rematch of a mid-January 70-63 Hawai'i win in Honolulu. The Gauchos took a 35-33 lead into halftime but shot just 36% from the field in the second half and allowed Hawai'i to take command with an 11-2 run after halftime. UCSB's blowout win over LBSU last week had a similar background story: The Gauchos blew a first-half lead with an ice-cold second half the first time they played the Beach. A similar rebound against Hawai'i will be a tougher proposition than it was against Long Beach, but the precedent is there. ""úWe have to do a great job of executing on offense,""ù Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úHawai'i's very good at defending and they really make you move the ball side to side. That's a credit to their defense and we have to do a great job on offense.""ù Senior guard Eddie Stansberry leads the Rainbow Warriors with 17 points per game and garnered Big West Player of the Week honors last week thanks to a 22-point performance in a win over CSUN. UCSB kept Stansberry quiet with just 6 points the first time the two teams met, a defensive performance the Gauchos would do well to repeat on Thursday. ""ú[Stansberry] is a great player,""ù Pasternack said. ""úI'm sure he's going to come out firing on all cylinders, so we're going to have to do a great job again of defending him, not just with one guy but with multiple defenders.""ù While UCSB managed to keep Stansberry from doing significant damage back in January, the team instead died a death of a thousand cuts. No Rainbow Warrior scored more than 12 points, but all but one scored at least 5. That balanced attack proved too much for the Gauchos to match, but the team could have stood a chance had it been able to shoot in the second half. If the LBSU game last week is any indication, the UCSB offense may be rounding into form just in time to avenge that second half. Thursday's game will be at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome and broadcast on Big West TV. One attendee will be picked to get a chance to make a half-court shot to win a free car at halftime.† Whatever happens on Thursday, the Gauchos won't have much time to rest and reload. Reigning Big West champion UC Irvine will visit on Saturday after playing UC Davis on Thursday night. The Anteaters have continued their winning ways in the Big West this season. UCI has lost just one of seven conference games, although the one loss was an upset at the hands of middling LBSU. Irvine had won 16 Big West games in a row before the loss to LBSU, a streak dating back to Jan. 16, 2019. The Beach held the Anteaters to a 33.8% performance from the field and kept UCI in the rearview mirror with wave after wave of scoring runs. The loss to LBSU was the first game in a mini swoon for the Anteaters, who beat Cal Poly by just 7 points three days later at home. Those two games aside, Irvine has won every Big West game by double digits. UCI's most recent conquest was a 91-61 drubbing of Cal State Fullerton last Saturday, although the team will play UC Davis on Thursday before traveling to UCSB. The Anteaters don't have one dominant scorer on offense, but they have several capable bucket-getters. Redshirt sophomore forward Collin Welp leads the team with 13.9 points per game and is second on UCI with 6.6 rebounds per game, despite starting only two games this season. Senior point guard Eyassu Worku plays the most minutes of any Anteater ""î 28.4 per game ""î and is second on the team with 12.1 points per game. Worku directs the UCI offense with a team-leading 4 assists per game and has also knocked down 42% of his 3-pointers on just under 4 attempts per game. UCI leads the Big West with 40.8 rebounds per game and has seven players averaging at least 3 rebounds per game. UCSB, however, allows just 28.9 rebounds per game, also a Big West-best. Saturday, then, will be a Newtonian clash of force and object. The Gauchos shoot a conference-best 46.8% from the field ""î which limits rebounding opportunities for opponents ""î but they'll still have their hands full trying to keep the Anteaters off the boards. Rebounding and victory have often gone hand in hand for UCSB this season, and that formula likely won't change on Saturday. First, the Gauchos will have to find a way to replicate LBSU's success and keep UCI's shooting percentages low and then they'll have to clean up on the boards in order to be competitive and take down the kings. Saturday's game will be broadcast by ESPNU and will take place at 7 p.m. in the Thunderdome.

This should be another tough road test for the Gauchos as Ohio State has been playing outstanding volleyball to start the year. When you look at the updated weekly rankings, UCSB has been able to maintain its spot at No. 3 in the country despite two tough losses to No. 2 BYU last weekend. As for Ohio State, they became ranked for the first time this week, grabbing a hold of the No. 15 position. Both teams have their work cut out for them in this battle of top collegiate programs.† Both of these schools have been playing really well in the early stages of the 2020 season. Ohio State comes in with an 8-1 record and the top stop in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. They have picked up some impressive wins, including 3-0 victories over USC and No. 9 Penn State. Their only loss of the year was a 3-1 loss to No. 7 UCLA. The Buckeyes have a strong one-two punch at the outside hitter position this year with Reese Devilbiss and Martin Lallemand. Both of these guys are upperclassmen and provide a large majority of their teams offensive production. They both have 91 kills on the year, far ahead of any other players on their roster. If UCSB wants to be successful this Friday, slowing down these two should be a key point of the† game plan.† As for UC Santa Barbara, they come into the week with a 6-2 record, trailing only No. 1 Hawai ªi in the Big West Conference. Last week, they suffered two tough losses against No. 2 BYU, but as of late they are still playing top-tier volleyball. Before last week, this team had 3-0 swept every team they had gone up against,partly because of players like Casey McGarry. The senior setter has been lights out this year, picking up 30+ assists in every game but one. He currently sits at a ridiculous 292 assists through eight games. The next closest guy, Grady Yould, is at just 23; this shows how pivotal McGarry is to the Gauchos offensive success. Ohio State should have their hands full with this high-octane UCSB attack.† Another interesting fact to note about this game is that these two teams played each other for a NCAA Championship back in 2011. Ohio State won that matchup as the teams faced off in Pennsylvania. Sure, that match was nearly 10 years ago and none of those players are around anymore, but could revenge still be on the Gauchos mind this upcoming weekend? Could be!† UCSB has another great opportunity ahead of them, a chance to bounce back after a tough week and pick up a gritty road win versus a top team in college volleyball. I think UCSB is looking for a statement road win to prove they belong as one of the top teams in the nation. The match's opening serve is at 4 p.m. in Columbus, Ohio.

UCSB is 6-3 to start off the year and has competed well in their first two non-conference invitationals so far. The Gauchos have picked up big wins over No. 3 UCLA, No. 19 Indiana, No. 20 Wagner and No. 24 Marist so far this season, proving that they definitely are deserving of their top-10 rank. Senior Sarah Snyder has continued to be the driving force behind this squad's success. The utility currently leads the team with 22 goals and 23 overall points, continuing her over two-year stretch of being the best scorer on the team. Sophomore utility Caitlyn Snyder has stepped up in more of a producing role compared to her older sister, creating opportunities for her teammates with a team-leading 7 assists so far. On the defensive end, goalkeeper Becca Buck has won all four matches that she has started. Both Buck and senior Kenzi Snyder are sharing goalie duties this season, but Buck has been a pleasant surprise for the Gauchos, posting 37 saves and only giving up 18 goals in her four wins. While the weekend schedule isn't completely set due to the invitational's tournament-style setup, UCSB will be facing off against either No. 7 UC San Diego or No. 24 Marist in its first matchup on Saturday.† The Gauchos already defeated Marist 11-6 in their game on Jan. 25, but a possible matchup against the Tritons would mark the first time these two teams have played since UCSB defeated them 8-6 almost exactly a year ago. If UCSB has to face off against the Tritons, the team's first step will be limiting juniors center Ciara Franke and utility Taylor Onstott.† Franke has knocked in a team-leading 19 goals so far this season, while Onstott is second on the team in goals (14) and first in assists (8). No other player has reached double digits in the scoring column yet, so cutting off opportunities for these two to score has to be a priority. The next game for the Gauchos, and the only match that is actually set so far, will be against No. 21 San Diego State. The Aztecs are 1-1 to start off the year, led by All-American Honorable Mention utility Emily Bennett. Bennett has scored 4 goals in the two games the Aztecs have played so far, and will be the focal point of the offense for years to come. This weekend is a great opportunity for the Gauchos to take on some of the top teams in the nation, and they will be hoping to gain some momentum heading into conference play.

After the victory, UCSB moved to 4-4 in the Big West Conference, while UC Irvine fell to 2-6 in conference play. With Irvine's lack of size on the inside, the game plan for the Gauchos was clear from the start: Feed the ball to Lane whenever possible. In one of the most impressive performances from a ""òChos player in recent memory, forward center Lane set her career-high while shooting 62.5% from the floor, while also grabbing a remarkable 20 rebounds on the night ""î tied for the most in her young career. ""ú[Lane] keeps the ball high and has poise and composure whenever she gets it,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. One key to UCSB's success on Wednesday was their ball movement, with the team recording 19 total assists on the night ""î including 7 from senior guard Coco Miller, who frequently found Lane in good positions. Midway through the third quarter, Miller hit Lane with a full-court pass that led to an easy layup, punctuating both the hustle and unselfishness that the ""òChos displayed all night long. ""úWe definitely came together this game,""ù Lane said. ""úThe chemistry was amazing. It was about communication and talking, just being aware of where we are.""ù Outside of Lane, junior point guard Danae Miller carried some of the burden on the offensive end as well. Despite leaving the game briefly in the third quarter due to injury, Miller was able to chip in 18 points while shooting 7-16 from the floor. On a night where the ""òChos could only muster 4 total 3-pointers, Miller's ability to stretch the defense by hitting 2 of her 3-pointers proved crucial in opening up space for Lane to operate. Starting her third game of the season, junior walk-on Mira Shulman also proved to be a key asset for UCSB on the night ""î particularly in the first half. In the second quarter, forward Shulman shot an uncontested 3-pointer giving UCSB a 22-12 lead and later made a smart cut to get an easy layup to bring the team up to 34-24That scoring stretch at the beginning of the second quarter created separation between Santa Barbara and Irvine, and the Anteaters would never overcome the deficit for the rest of the game. Of course, UCSB's defense also played a crucial role in their victory on Wednesday. While Irvine shot 43% from the floor, their 10 turnovers on the night ultimately doomed them. Senior point guard Lauren Saiki continued her excellent season for the Anteaters, dropping 18 points on 50% from the floor, while freshman forward Sophia Locandro scored 14 points as well. In addition to the Anteater's turnovers, their bench failed to give a significant contribution on the nightIn total, UCI's bench only scored 2 points ""î not nearly enough to pull off a road victory in conference play. While Irvine has struggled all season, every victory is crucial in conference play; with the win, UCSB jumped into a tie for fourth place in the conference. After an eighth-place finish last season, the ""òChos appear poised to easily top that mark this year. Next, the Gauchos must turn their attention to Hawai'i, who come to town in second place with a 6-3 conference record. Still, this game proved that when the team fires on all cylinders, they can compete with any team in the conference ""î especially given the talent of Lane. UCSB takes on Hawai'i at the Thunderdome on Saturday at 2 p.m. Comments are closed.

Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus After capturing only two wins over the course of six-straight away matches, the idea of returning home seemed like a promising disruption for the UC Santa Barbara men's tennis, especially when remembering last year's outstanding 9-1 home record. However, the team let yet another match slip, this time falling 4-3 to Fresno State. The Gauchos' overall record, consequently, was knocked down to 2-5, while Fresno evened theirs to 2-2.† It's been five seasons since Santa Barbara has lost to Fresno State. Tracing all the way back to 2015, the team did not once allow the Bulldogs to secure more than a point, and even bested them 7-0 in 2016. The Bulldogs came into this year's match with a more ferocious bite, challenging UCSB all the way through. Santa Barbara has continuously been unable to maintain an upper hand in its doubles competitions, and frustratingly, this match was no different. Fresno State brought the Gauchos down early to claim the majority.† Even after a hopeful win at the No. 1 spot last week versus Pepperdine, juniors Joseph Rotheram and Victor Krustev were taken down in a 6-2 set by Fresno's freshman-senior pair Johannes Seeman and Cagatay Soke. The Bulldog duo remains undefeated on court one. Senior-sophomore pairing Alex Dominguez Soto and Luka Vukmanovic caught the other loss in a closer 6-4 set.† Unsurprisingly, senior co-captain Joseph Guillin and sophomore Alejandro Vedri were and remain to be the exception to this fate. The pair triumphed at the No. 2 spot with a 6-3 win over Bulldog senior-duo Angus Bradshaw and Zdenek Derkas.† As a pair and on their own, Guillin and Vedri have been key sources of stability for the team. Two weeks ago, Vedri's overall performance earned him the title of Big West Men's Athlete of the Week. The second-year continued to impress, bringing home another win on Thursday.† This week, the accolade was handed over to No. 8 Guillin, whose four official wins this season have included one over a fellow nationally-ranked player from Pepperdine. Versus Fresno State, the co-captain defeated Derkas in two sets, the last being an almost too-close-for-comfort win.† At the end of the day, all eyes turned to rookie Joshua Williams, the Gaucho freshman who has had a solid showing in his short collegiate career. Against senior Henrique Wojciecnowski Osorio, Williams swiped the first set 6-3, but Osario reversed the score, securing the second and pushing his opponent to a third-set tiebreaker. In a fiery battle between the players, the Fresno State returner clinched the win for the Bulldogs with a 7-6 (7-5) victory.† Overall, UCSB and Fresno State ended with an even 3-3 split in the singles competitions. Krustev escaped his unlucky streak on the doubles side to secure a quick two-set win in the No. 2 spot, joining teammates Vedri and Guillin.† The missed opportunity to claim a win on their home court might be one to lament, as they are set to hit the road again and will not see another home game until the tail end of the month. But the Gauchos have no time to quell on the loss, as their rebound time is just a short three days.† UCSB is set to play the University of Arizona ""î a Pac 12 mega-house ranked 23rd in the nation and stacked with several nationally ranked players. The Wildcats already have nine games under their belt and sport an outstanding 8-1 record, which is sure to challenge Santa Barbara. UCSB's eighth dual match will begin at 1 p.m. this Sunday, Feb. 9.† Comments are closed.

Sow shot 12-13 from the floor for a career-high 30 points and was destructive for a defense that has been leaking all season, despite the Rainbow Warriors' comfortable 5-3 position in the conference standings.† Had Head Coach Joe Pasternack's squad not shot 3-14 from deep, the score could have been much different. It was all-hands-on-deck for a Gaucho team that played composed and together. If they can manage to sustain their run to form, UCSB will look ready to roll as a team capable of dominating in the paint, shooting from the floor and making free throws.† UCSB shot 15-16 at the line against Hawai'i and another 21-25 when Irvine came into town. That's a lot of free throws. A lot of small little tests on the brain in addition to what's being done on the court.† An area that was once more of a hindrance is now a reflection of UCSB's new mentality as a conference force. They started by getting their collective shot together, another area that fueled their three-game losing streak.† They handled injuries well, and JaQuori McLaughlin has managed to get back on track in recent games. It's especially positive considering the team has rattled off three big wins in that time.† After that, there has been evidence of an obvious improvement in the Gauchos from the line. They've shot 88.43% over the past three games after having managed a 72.6% showing over the previous five games, a stretch that saw them go 1-4.† They've been one of the better teams in the paint but have come together to produce some marvelous displays, with a special note to Sow's 15/14/1 line in the last match against Long Beach State.† Of the 14 boards, 7 were offensive and 7 were defensive.† Matt Freeman also put up 24 points in that game and shot 6-7 from deep.† Now 7-2 in conference, UC Irvine made the drive to the Thunderdome where UCSB proved victorious by 64-61 on the back of Sow's 21-point double-double. McLaughlin chipped in his best performance since the nudge in practice, scoring 11/3/2 with a 7-8 showing from the line. Irvine finished as the game leader in rebounds by 36-28, but Sow was dominant and led both teams with 10 as the only member of the double-figures club.† The story has been very much about Sow and that's because he's coming into his own in a team that's clicking on both sides of the floor.† The Anteaters have a two-game lead on Hawai'i who sit with a game in hand against UCSB and CSUN, who are deadlocked at 5-4 for third place.† Despite having already swept the Gauchos this season, the Matadors have paired big victories with subpar performances and find themselves alongside UCSB in the standings. The Gauchos, meanwhile, are now back on track in their pursuit of the title. They've now won three straight games for the first time since they capped a six-game win streak in their season opener against Cal Poly back in early January.† There was a funk among the team and a few scuffs led to the Gauchos dropping three straight games just after that dominant display over the Mustangs.† They're looking organized and disciplined, led by big man Sow and a sizzling cast around him, just in time for a Thursday night match against UC Davis ""î a must-win game to solidify that the Gauchos are, indeed, not pretenders.

sports,No. 3 UCSB Takes Down No. 15 Ohio State and No. 9 Penn State,10-Feb-20,12:43 PM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-10/ucsb-mens-volleyball-takes-down-no-15-ohio-state-and-no-9-penn-state/,"Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Over the weekend, the UCSB men's volleyball team had another tough road test, this time in the Midwest, as they traveled to Columbus, Ohio to play Ohio State and Penn State. The No. 3 Gauchos faced off against No. 15 Ohio State on Friday and No. 9 Penn State the following evening. UCSB came into the weekend looking to bounce back after suffering their first two losses of the season to Brigham Young University the previous week. The Gauchos would adjust and show out, picking up two huge wins in a hostile road environment.† The first of the two matches was against the home team, Ohio State. Things started off a little shaky for UCSB, as they fell behind and eventually lost the first set 26-28. Santa Barbara had set point before the momentum shifted to the home team, fueling a Buckeye set victory. The Gauchos would quickly adjust, however, starting the second set in dominant fashion and going up 8-2. They would never look back from here. They began spreading out the offensive attack, getting several different Gaucho hitters involved. Three different UCSB players had double-digit kill nights: Randy DeWeese had the match-high 17, Ryan Wilcox had 13 and Roy McFarland finished with 12. UC Santa Barbara would take the second set 25-19. After that second set, it was clear UCSB had the Buckeyes' offense figured out. The Gauchos would dominate these next two sets, holding Ohio State's hitting percentage to just .211%. They were able to secure 10 points on blocks and rack up 48 digs over the course of the match. UCSB would coast in the next two sets, handily winning 25-19 and 25-18. This gave SB their seventh win on the year and their fourth against ranked competition. The Gauchos wouldn't have long to celebrate, as they squared off against another ranked opponent ""î Penn State ""î the following night.† The second match of the weekend turned out to be a thriller! Things started slow for UCSB, while conversely, Penn State came out swinging at an alarming rate. They hit a ridiculous .458% in the first frame which gave the Gauchos a load of trouble. The Nittany Lions would win this set 25-19. The second of the five sets was the closest of the match, as Santa Barbara's defense really stepped up. Their defense was able to pick up significantly more blocks in this one, but a few serving aces by Penn State gave them the 25-23 victory. Penn State led 2-0 at the break. UCSB wasn't going to fold even with their backs against the wall. They would make key adjustments and turn the momentum of this game around. The Gauchos played the third game at a much more efficient clip, hitting at .583%. Several kills by sophomore outside hitter Wilcox led the way for Santa Barbara as they would take the third set 25-15. Wilcox had a match-high 20 kills on the day. I think the Gauchos knew that if they won the fourth set, the momentum was in their favor and they would have a good shot at stealing a win. UCSB's defense played really well in this set and several service errors by Penn State allowed SB to jump out to an early lead. Senior setter Casey McGarry led the way in passing yet again for the Gauchos, racking up 44 assists in the set. The ball movement in this one let Santa Barbara roll to a 25-19 win, forcing a fifth and final set. The fifth set was a rollercoaster in terms of scoring streaks. Penn State came out and scored the first 4 points before UCSB would respond with an 8-1 run of their own. Big kills and a late service ace by Wilcox gave Santa Barbara the 15-9 set and match victory. This was an unreal comeback for UCSB, as coming back from being down 0-2 on the road is really challenging and the Gauchos rose to the occasion.†† Now, with an 8-2 record, UCSB has one more road match at UCLA before a much-needed home stretch. This week's game will be played at Pauley Pavilion this Wednesday at 7 p.m.

sports,Poor Second Quarter Dooms Gauchos Against Rainbow Wahine,10-Feb-20,2:39 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-10/poor-second-quarter-dooms-gauchos-against-rainbow-wahine/,"Estef Zuniga / Daily Nexus An inconsistent offensive performance ultimately doomed the UCSB women's basketball team on Saturday, as the team fell to Hawai'i 63-51 at the Thunderdome. For the Gauchos, freshman forward-center Ila Lane led the way once again with 20 points and an eye-popping 15 rebounds, while senior guard Coco Miller chipped in 19 points on an efficient 7-15 shooting. From the get-go, it seemed like the Gauchos (9-13, 4-5) had the firepower to knock off the second-place Rainbow Wahine (13-10, 7-3). UCSB came storming out of the gate, with freshman Lane scoring 7 straight points to start the game. With Hawai'i attempting an aggressive full-court press in the first quarter, the ""òChos were able to take advantage of the available space on the halfcourt ""î especially Miller, who drilled three 3's in the first quarter. In total, Santa Barbara scored 20 points in the first quarter on 44% shooting from the floor ""î one of the team's best quarters in recent memory. In the second quarter, however, the wheels began to fall off for the Gauchos. In one of their poorest single-quarter performances of the season, the ""òChos only scored 3 points in the entire quarter, with the team going 1-10 from the floor. The team also struggled to break the press during this quarter, turning the ball over 5 times. ""úOur offense was too stagnant today,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úWe gotta move our guy and move the ball to move the defense. We got caught standing and watching too much, and we need to be more aggressive.""ù For much of the night, UCSB's defense kept them competitive against a very solid Hawai'i team. In particular, Miller excelled on the defensive end, grabbing 2 steals in the second quarter and 6 in the entire game. Despite UCSB's lack of offense in the second quarter, the team still managed to hold Hawai'i to 10 points in the quarter; somehow, Santa Barbara only trailed by 3 at the half, 23-26. But in the second half, senior Julissa Tago and junior Lauren Rewers demonstrated why Hawai'i has dominated opponents all season in the Big West. Tago ""î who leads the team with 14.1 points per game ""î showed off her scoring prowess on Saturday, finishing the game with 21 points on 8-11 shooting from the floor. In the second half in particular, Tago burned UCSB, dropping a blistering 15 points. Because the ""òChos were forced to respect Tago's midrange jumper, she was able to get to the bucket at will in the second half, resulting in easy layup after easy layup. Coming off the bench, Rewers put in one of her finest performances of the season on Saturday, finishing with 16 points on the night ""î well above her 6.4 season average. Perhaps more importantly, Rewers ability to hit 3's stretched UCSB's defense, which initially allowed Rewers to take wide-open shots behind the arc. In that fourth quarter, Rewers hit back-to-back 3's when UCSB had cut their deficit to 5 points, ensuring that the Rainbow Wahine kept a comfortable lead. While UCSB held Hawai'i to 63 points on the night, the Gauchos' offense continued to struggle in the second half. For the game, the Gauchos merely shot 34.5% from the floor while also turning the ball over 16 times. With the victory, Hawai'i remains in second place in the conference, while Santa Barbara falls to sixth place. Now, the Gauchos must quickly rebound as they take on two opponents ahead of them in the standings: Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge. UCSB will travel to Long Beach to take on the 49ers on Thursday before going down to Northridge and taking on the Matadors on Saturday. Comments are closed.

Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The UCSB men's tennis team took a brutal blow this Sunday from No. 23 University of Arizona. The 0-7 final score only added salt to Santa Barbara's growing wound, pushing their record down to 2-6 on the season. The Wildcats, on the other hand, continue to boost their near-perfect record which now sits remarkably high at 9-1.†† Still, Sunday's showing proved to be a wake-up call for the Gaucho lineup that was knocked at every match of the day. Admittedly, as Arizona strutted into the dual match boasting an unmatchable range of statistics, it seemed the odds had already settled on the wrong side of the court. Before playing SB, the Wildcats' singles and doubles records were each above .600. Throughout the season and against the Gauchos as well, Arizona's singles competitions have largely been led by junior Filip Malbasic, freshman Nick Lagaev and senior Alejandro Reguant ""î each of whom's singles record lies above .775.† Co-captain Joseph Guillin, whose performance so far had earlier earned him the title of Big West Athlete of the Week, saw his second official loss of the season. The senior faced #76 Malbasic, the junior out of Stockholm who, as of a week ago, carried with him an impressive 16-4 overall record, going 7-2 in dual matches. The #8 athlete fell in identical 5-7 sets to Malbasic, making it the Gauchos' fifth loss of the day. Juniors Joseph Rotheram and Victor Krustev battled fiercely on courts two and four, each driving their stellar opponents to a third tiebreaker set. Rotheram had come out strong against Lagaev, beating him 6-4 in set one. But the rookie regained control and held Rotheram to just 3 points in the second set and was finally able to secure the win in the third. Versus Reguant, Krustev pulled out a redeeming 7-5 victory in his second set but ultimately lost the momentum going into the tiebreaker.† Sophomore Luka Vukmanovic struggled throughout his match which opened the day's singles competitions. Vukmanovic was planted on the No. 5 court to face Carlos Hassey, the only member of Arizona's starting lineup to come in with a solo record not greater than .500. In the first set, the Swiss athlete managed only 2 points compared to Hassey's 6; in the second, the junior Arizona native kept him scoreless.† Santa Barbara's performance on the doubles courts once again offered no relief. Guillin and 2020 partner Alejandro Vedri left their unfinished match leading 5-4. The rest ""î consisting of pairs Krustev and Rotheram, and Alex Soto and Vukmanovic ""î were unable to get their scores above 3.† This loss undoubtedly dug the Gauchos a little bit deeper into the hole that's been growing since the start of the season. Compounded by the fact that Santa Barbara has only had one week that didn't consist of traveling since January, it may be that what we need is a change of scenery ""î and one that lasts longer than just a game. UCSB will play just two more away games until they return to their home court for seven ""î hopefully redeeming ""î matches. For now, the team will turn their attention to the University of Minnesota who they will face this Saturday, Feb. 15.

sports,Red-Hot Gauchos Look To Extend Win Streak Against Aggies,13-Feb-20,6:14 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/red-hot-gauchos-look-to-extend-win-streak-against-aggies/,"Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus After two huge victories last week, the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team is riding high. That could be an issue against UC Davis, whose record and small size make them easy to overlook. While there's no easy way to avoid overconfidence, the Gauchos have just the right tool to take advantage of the Aggies' short stature: sophomore big-man Amadou Sow. Sow, who earned Big West Player of the Week honors for his team-leading performances in UCSB's wins over Hawai'i and UC Irvine last week, is on a roll and ready to overwhelm UC Davis. The Aggies are 10-15 overall this season and 4-5 in the Big West and have exactly one player over 6'3""ù who plays more than 20 minutes per game. UC Irvine recently pulled off a season sweep of UC Davis and provided UCSB with a blueprint on how to do so. The Anteaters' size was too much for the Aggies, whom they outscored 74-30 in the paint and outrebounded by a combined total of 25 rebounds. Sow will get his chance to do similar damage on Thursday night in Davis. The sophomore is coming off of a dominant week that saw him set a career high for points with 30 in the Hawai'i game and then followed that up with a 21-point, 10-rebound performance against UC Irvine. ""úAmadou has done a great job,""ù UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úHe's had some poor basketball games, and he's done an amazing job of recovering, and I'm really happy for him.""ù UC Davis' lack of size presents opportunities not just for the Gaucho big men, but for the guards as well. Senior Max Heidegger and junior JaQuori McLaughlin both excel at getting inside and finishing at the rim, and they should have plenty of opportunities to do so against an Aggie team that blocks a Big West-worst 1.8 shots a game. While they don't block very many shots, UCD does boast some of the quickest hands on the West Coast. The Aggies average 6.1 steals per game this season and have forced a conference-best 14.2 turnovers per game in conference play. ""úUC Davis is number one in the conference at forcing turnovers,""ù Pasternack said. ""úThat's their best thing they do. They really do a great job of defending the three and forcing turnovers.""ù On the other end of the court, UC Davis tends to live and die by the 3-pointer. The Aggies are shooting a stunning 40.1% from 3-point land in conference play, and they lead the Big West with 79 made 3-pointers against conference opponents. ""úMatchups are very hard [against UC Davis],""ù Pasternack said. ""úThey're very small, and they can really shoot the ball. We're going to be challenged to defend the three.""ù Senior guard Stefan Gonzalez isn't just UCD's top sniper; he's one of the best shooters in the country. Gonzalez is third in the NCAA with a .479 3-point field goal percentage and makes about three 3-pointers a game. When Gonzalez is clicking, and he has been in pretty much every game this season, there's not much the opposing team can do but relentlessly deny him the ball. Gonzalez's fellow senior guard Joe Mooney is UC Davis' leading scorer with 13.2 points per game, although he's scored in the single digits in five of his last six games. Freshman point guard Ezra Manjon has stepped up instead with 15.4 points per game in Big West play while averaging 4.2 assists per game over that same time span. The Aggies have won two of their last three games, with the most recent win an 87-81 victory over Cal State Fullerton that saw sophomore forward Caleb Fuller explode for a career-high 23 points. UCD's 4-5 conference record is somewhat middling but is just a game back of UCSB for third place in the Big West. For the Gauchos, the task on Thursday evening will be to keep the Aggies from doing too much damage from behind the 3-point line and to stay steady after three wins in a row. The winning streak and the feeling of beating two of the Big West's best in Hawai'i and UC Irvine is undoubtedly intoxicating, but UC Davis won't be forgiving if UCSB gets too cocky. ""úEvery single game has a different life of its own,""ù Pasternack said. ""úWe just have to keep playing team basketball and sharing the basketball and getting assists and defending.""ù The Gauchos are far from a Goliath, even with three wins in a row, but they'd still do well to follow that prescription when they take on the David-sized UC Davis team. UCSB plays UC Davis in Davis on Thursday at 7 p.m.

sports,UCSB Travels South For Crucial Conference Games,13-Feb-20,5:15 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-13/ucsb-travels-south-for-crucial-conference-games/,"Nexus File Photo For the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team, every conference game is of the utmost importance. This week, however, that statement is especially pertinent, as the sixth-place Gauchos travel down to Southern California to take on third-place Long Beach State (LBSU) and fifth-place Cal State Northridge (CSUN) in two crucial conference matchups. More than halfway through conference play, UCSB (9-13, 4-5) has already surpassed public expectations this season; in the preseason media poll, the ""òChos were selected to finish last in the conference. Nine games through conference play last season, Santa Barbara was 2-7, fighting tooth and nail to finish eighth in the conference and secure the last tournament bid. Still, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the team will not merely settle for improvement. On Saturday, UCSB showed that it still needs to find more consistency if it hopes to compete with the elite teams in the Big West. After a 20-point first quarter against second-place Hawai'i, the ""òChos offense came to a complete halt, with the team only scoring 31 points the rest of the game. With two difficult road matchups on tap this week, UCSB will need to be locked in for 80 minutes straight if the team hopes to maneuver its way up to third place in the conference. On Thursday, Santa Barbara will take on Long Beach State (10-12, 5-4), a team that has struggled as of late after storming out of the gate to begin conference play. The 49ers have lost their last two conference games by an average of 22 points, with the team only averaging 42.5 points per game in those road losses. In their last game ""î a 61-41 blowout loss to Cal Poly ""î the 49ers were in large part let down by their free-throw shooting, with the team shooting 4-13 from the line on the night. In addition, Shanaijah Davison ""î a junior guard who leads the team with 13.4 points per game ""î was held scoreless during that game, going 0-9 from the floor on the night. If UCSB are to knock off LBSU, the Gauchos will need yet another big game from freshman center Ila Lane. One area Long Beach struggles with is on the boards, with the team usually getting outrebounded by more than 9 rebounds per game. Last week, Lane alone averaged 17.5 rebounds per game; with no 49er player averaging more than 5.7 rebounds per game, Lane should once again feast on Thursday. However, in front of their home crowd, the 49ers will undoubtedly put up a strong fight. LBSU is a far better home team than road team, with a solid 6-3 record at home this season vs 2-9 on the road. In addition, Long Beach makes up for its lack of size by creating extra possessions on the defensive end. LBSU forces almost 21 turnovers a game ""î a staggering number""î while only turning the ball over about 14 times per game. UCSB's guards ""î namely senior Coco Miller and junior Danae Miller ""î will need to take care of the ball if the Gauchos hope to steal a road victory. ""úThey have tremendous athletes on the ball and in the passing lanes,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe need to make sure we stay aggressive while also staying disciplined on offense.""ù On Saturday, things won't get any easier for the ""òChos when they travel to Northridge for a matchup against fifth-place CSUN (9-13, 4-4). The Matadors have also struggled as of late, dropping their last three games. Still, Northridge has proven in the past that they can hang with any team in the conference ""î punctuated by their 58-54 victory over Hawai'i earlier this season. Much of UCSB's success on Saturday will come down to its ability to limit De'Jionae Calloway. A redshirt senior, Calloway has dominated the interior all season, averaging 14.1points per game and 8.1 rebounds per game despite standing at only 6 feet.† One of the keys for UCSB in that game will be Lane staying out of foul trouble while guarding Calloway in the paint. With Northridge lacking in size as a team, Lane should have another dominant performance if she can stay on the floor. UCSB will take on LBSU on Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Pyramid, before traveling down to Northridge and taking on CSUN at 7 p.m. on Saturday. Comments are closed.

With the split, the Gauchos (10-14, 5-6) moved into fourth place in the Big West conference, jumping over Cal State Northridge (CSUN) in the process.† During Wednesday's practice, Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the coaching staff emphasized the need to take care of the ball against the tenacious Long Beach State (LBSU) defense. While the 49ers are undersized, they pester opponents with their æ court press, forcing 21.3 turnovers per game. On Thursday, however, turnovers would prove to be the Achilles' heel for the ""òChos ""î who turned the ball over 23 times on the night. ""úThey have tremendous athletes on the ball and in the passing lanes,""ù Henrickson said about LBSU. In a low-scoring, defensive slugfest, those turnovers would prove to be the difference. LBSU scored 24 points off of turnovers, and scored 20 fastbreak points on the night. In comparison, UCSB did not score a single point in transition in the entire game. Still, the Gauchos hung around for most of the night ""î thanks in large part to the continued dominance of freshman forward-center Ila Lane. In one of her more efficient performances of the season, Lane finished the game with 18 points on 87.5% shooting, while also grabbing 12 rebounds for yet another double-double. Outside of Lane, however, UCSB struggled to create offense for much of the night. Only one other player ""î senior guard Coco Miller ""î scored in double figures on the night for Santa Barbara, and she did so on 4-16 shooting from the floor. For most of the night, the Gauchos' offensive struggles were nothing but a minor inconvenience, especially with the ""òChos' defense thriving. After three quarters, UCSB had held LBSU to merely 36 points, with Long Beach turning the ball over 14 times in the first three quarters. In the fourth quarter, however, things fell apart for the team. Long Beach proceeded to score 23 points on 70% shooting; with UCSB's offense still nowhere to be found, the Gauchos were unable to keep pace. Junior guard Shanaijah Davison and sophomore guard Justina King led the way for Long Beach on the night, with the duo finishing with 19 points and 17 points, respectively. On Saturday, however, UCSB used a 23-point fourth quarter of its own to knock off Cal State Northridge on the road. Heading into the matchup, all eyes were on the paint battle between Lane and redshirt senior De'Jionae Calloway ""î who entered the game averaging 14.3 points per game and 8.2 rebounds per game. After 40 minutes of play, Lane emerged the clear winner from that individual battle, finishing the game with 16 points and 17 rebounds. Meanwhile, Calloway struggled for much of the night, finishing with only 4 points on 2-12 shooting for the night. Senior guard Tal Sahar also turned in one of her best performances of the season, chipping in 18 points off the bench for UCSB. In the fourth quarter in particular, Sahar left her stamp on the game, drilling three 3-pointers and shooting 75% from behind the arc in the quarter. In addition, Miller did an excellent job of facilitating the offense all night; while she struggled from the field, she finished the game with 8 assists to lead the team. For the Matadors, second-year guard Jordyn Jackson was the high-scorer on the night with 16 points ""î the only CSUN player to score double figures on the night.† With a logjam in the middle of the Big West standings, every game matters to the Gauchos from now on. This week, UCSB will return home to take on CSUN once again on Thursday before hosting UC Riverside on Saturday in a revenge game. Comments are closed.

sports,Men's Tennis Continues Rough Start to the Season,17-Feb-20,3:19 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-17/mens-tennis-continues-rough-start-to-the-season/,"Set up for a nice serve. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team saw their second straight blowout on Saturday against the University of Minnesota. This loss, which marked the team's fourth in a row, will push the Gauchos down to a 2-7 overall record. Minnesota's fate, however, looked a little different as they carried over the same momentum and success from last weekend's spotless 7-0 win over Yale. The Gophers executed an all-around takedown of the Gauchos, sweeping them in a 7-0 dual match on their home court. Looking ahead, the Maroon and Gold are now just eight games away from hitting their 100th since the fall. In the last match of the day, #85 Stefan Milicevic delivered a nasty upset when he beat Santa Barbara's #8 Joseph Guillin ""î his first victory over a top-10 opponent ""î in two 7-6(3),7-5 sets at the No. 1 spot in singles competitions. These past two weeks have set Milicevic on an upward slope, looking now at 12 wins on the season and a two-game win streak. For Guillin, time has done the opposite and rocked him out of his early dominance.† Retrospectively, the match culminated an entire day's worth of frustration from the Gaucho's perspective. UCSB dug themselves into a hole early on, starting the day by losing two crucial points in doubles competition. Senior co-captain Guillin and sophomore Alejandro Vedri, a pair that has been arguably the sole consistent force in SB's doubles play, fell first to Minnesota's Vlad Lobak and Siim Troost in a swift 6-2 match. The partners now lead their team in both dual match and overall records ""î together, they have seen just one loss out of a total of nine matches. Junior partners Victor Krustev and Joseph Rotheram took the next defeat on the No. 2 court, facing first-time duo Milicevic and Jackson Allen. For Minnesota, Allen has proven to be a dynamic doubles partner. The junior has now appeared on the court with three different starters. Despite the inconsistency, Allen's personal doubles record has floated above the rest at 13-5 overall. In singles play, the Minnesota Gophers dominated even further, disallowing all but Guillin ""î who pushed a set to 7 points ""î to even touch the 5-point mark. On courts two through five, UCSB players were taken out in two swift sets by their Minnesota counterparts. Lobak clinched the match for Minnesota in two identical 6-2 sets against Krustev. Lobak and Troost, who had earlier picked up a doubles win, each added wins to their already impressive records. Both of them now boast 13 wins on the season and eight and seven in the dual-match season, respectively. At this point, the Gauchos' track record for away games has spoken for itself. Winning just one of six of its past away matches, Santa Barbara is in dire need of a change of scenery and is not far from it. UCSB will leg through just one more road match against Indiana before heading back home.†

sports,No. 3 UCSB Travels to Pauley Pavilion To Take on No. 8 UCLA,19-Feb-20,1:23 PM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-19/no-3-ucsb-travels-to-pauley-pavilion-to-take-on-no-8-ucla/,"Leonard Paulasa / The Daily Nexus UC Santa Barbara men's volleyball team is on the road this week, set to take on UC Los Angeles at Pauley Pavilion this Wednesday. UCSB comes into this one as the No. 3 team in the country with an 8-2 record. The match should be a good one, as UCLA is the No. 8 team in the country, holding a 7-5 record. After a week with no matches for UCSB, the players must feel ready and excited for a chance to play another top-ranked opponent. As for UCLA, they want nothing more than an upset win versus the Gauchos in front of their home crowd. It would be huge toward their resume when considering the national ranks. Wednesday's contest looks to be a battle of college volleyball heavyweights.† UCSB has been playing exceptional volleyball early in this 2020 season. The last† two games went phenomenally for Santa Barbara. They won 3-1 at No. 15 Ohio State and 3-2 against No. 9 Penn State the following day. The Penn State match was utter madness ""î a rollercoaster of emotions. UCSB went down early and ended up losing the first two sets. The Gauchos never looked defeated though, as they would claw their way back, winning the next two sets and forcing a fifth and final set. In that final set, the teams traded blows, but ultimately UCSB came out on top and completed an unlikely 0-2 comeback.† A large reason for the Gauchos success has been thanks to stellar play by some of their senior leaders. Setter Casey McGarry has been playing lights out this season, racking up 30+ assists in every game but one for the Gauchos. The team's leading scorer to start the year has been outside hitter Randy DeWeese. He has been racking up kills (122) at an intriguing rate of 3.39 kills per set. These two seniors should have a big impact on the outcome of Wednesday's match. As for UCLA, a lot of their losses this season seem to be because of inexperience at the college level. The majority of their offensive load falls on the shoulders of two freshmen. Outside hitters Cole Ketrzynski and Alex Knight are one and two on the team in kills. Ketrzynski who has 126 kills and Knight who has 87 kills on the year have both been playing beyond their years. The Bruins will likely be relying heavily on these two in Wednesday's match.† All signs point to UCSB coming out and putting on a show at Wednesday night's match. This is the Gaucho's final road match before returning home to play Pepperdine this weekend. UCSB hasn't had a home game in over a month now, so it makes sense that they would like to go into that first home stretch riding some good momentum.† The match is being played this Wednesday at 7 p.m. on the campus of UCLA, in Pauley Pavilion. If you can't make it to Los Angeles to support your Gauchos, you can still watch, as the game will be livestreamed on the Pac-12 network's website.

sports,"After Nine-Game Road Trip, Gauchos Set To Host Tigers, Dons",20-Feb-20,10:03 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-20/after-nine-game-road-trip-gauchos-set-to-host-tigers-dons/,"Chasing the ball. Siavash Ghadiri/Daily Nexus Coming off of a pair of losses from the long weekend's matches versus Minnesota and Indiana, the UC Santa Barbara men's tennis team has again failed to put an end to the painful trend which has foregrounded its 2020 season. After what resulted in a 4-2 loss on another unfamiliar indoor court, the most recent match against the Hoosiers left Santa Barbara frustrated and longing for a familiar environment. Within a sparse collection of singles wins, senior Joseph Guillin was at the receiving end of another upset ""î his second of the weekend ""î and the partners participating in doubles once again dropped the ball on the day. Consequently, UCSB's dual-match record fell to 2-8, the lowest it has been since the seniors entered the program in the 2015-16 season. Yet now, after nine games on the road, the Gauchos are finally coming home. In two back-to-back matches against the University of the Pacific and the University of San Francisco (USF), Santa Barbara will have the chance to reclaim their seemingly lost mojo. † The weekend will begin with a face-off between the Gauchos and the Pacific Tigers, a crucial match which SB can hopefully use to reverse its fate. With just a single win interrupting a spread of six otherwise straight losses since the beginning of January, Pacific comes in with an underwhelming 1-6 overall record. † But the Tigers likely have some fight left over from their most recent match against Santa Barbara's seasoned competitor, UC Irvine. Pacific battled Irvine in a fiery competition but ultimately fell 3-4, losing ground in doubles competitions. † Freshman Coby McCaig has been a recurring name across the Tigers' last few matches. Along with a singles victory in his latest appearance against Irvine, the Modesto native clinched Pacific's first dual match win versus Grand Canyon with a well-earned 6-3, 7-5 triumph on court six. † However, Sunday's match versus USF will likely pose more of a threat to the Gauchos' comeback. In their past eight games, the Dons have seen an inconsistent mix of outcomes, from lofty sweeps to 1-point margin losses. Accordingly, the Northern California-based team currently splits their dubs and defeats to make a 4-4 overall record. † Interestingly, USF has seen many of the same competitors as Santa Barbara. Where UCSB was able to scrounge its second and most recent victory against Loyola Marymount University in a tight 4-3 match at the start of the month, USF fell 3-4 to the Lions in its first game of the season. †The Dons will arrive in Santa Barbara just a week after their equalizing 4-0 blowout over Boise State. Here, the spotlight shone early on San Francisco's pairs in doubles competition. Sophomore partners Mitch Johnson and Phuc Huynh finished a swift 6-3 takedown to secure the first win of the day and were followed by freshman-senior duo Ori Maior and Paul Giraud, who clinched the doubles point. † It is exactly this early success, especially in the doubles department, that the Gauchos have been lacking over their last ten games. Executing a win over either team will necessarily require readjustment ""î even more than pushing Joseph Rotheram and Victor Krustev into the two spot, as Head Coach Marty Davis did against Indiana. †More than ever, local crowds may help to remind the Gauchos of the encouragement and support they've been missing the past two months. Come and join in welcoming the Gauchos back home this Saturday and Sunday, at 1:30 p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively, on the Rec Cen courts. † † Comments are closed.

The team also has two chances at revenge. On Thursday evening, the Gauchos travel to take on Cal State Fullerton (CSUF) on the road before quickly returning to the Thunderdome to host UC Davis (UCD) on Saturday. The Titans bounced UCSB from the Big West Tournament last season, and the Aggies handed the Gauchos their most recent loss last Thursday. The Cal State Fullerton team this season is quite different from the one that ended UCSB's season last year. Both of the Titans' leading scorers from last season are gone and playing professional ball in Europe, leaving Jackson Rowe, Brandon Kamga and Austen Awosika behind to handle much of the offensive load. Rowe was Fullerton's third-leading scorer last season and has picked up where he left off from last year. The senior forward missed the first 13 games of the season with a knee injury but is averaging a team-leading 15.6 points on 42.4% three-point shooting since his return. Kamga is just a tick behind Rowe at 15.2 points per game overall this season but is averaging a team-high 19 points per game in conference play. Kamga, a graduate transfer from High Point University, is new to the Fullerton program but seems to have acclimated quite well. ""úKamga [""¶] is probably second in our league to [Cal State Northridge's (CSUN)] Lamine Diane,""ù UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úHe does a great, great job of getting baskets.""ù †Senior guard Awosika brings up the rear of the scoring triumvirate with 13.5 points per game, but he chips in 4 rebounds and a team-best 4.0 assists per game.† The Titans are 10-16 overall this season, but they're just a half-game behind the Gauchos in the Big West at 5-6. Thursday's game isn't just a chance for UCSB to avenge last year's loss ""î it's an opportunity for Fullerton to move up the ladder. ""úThey're the team that knocked us out in the conference tournament,""ù Pasternack said. ""úThey're always a very good team. The league is so well rounded. The parity is amazing. On any given night, anybody can beat anybody.""ù Fullerton has compiled a record that proves Pasternack's point. The Titans have lost to the Big West's two last-place teams, Cal Poly and UC Riverside and have beaten UC Davis and CSUN, both tied for second.† Not only that, but Fullerton also upset UCLA earlier this season.† It's hard to know exactly what to expect from the Titans, but recent history suggests a lot of offense is likely. In six of CSUF's last seven games, at least one team has scored over 70 points. The Gauchos don't have much time to recover from Thursday's game before they take on UC Davis at home on Saturday night. The two teams just met last Thursday, when the Aggies won 84-75 in a game more lopsided than the score would indicate. UCSB couldn't buy a bucket in the first half, shooting just 36% to Davis' 50% mark. The Aggies took full advantage of the Gauchos' slow start and rocketed out to a 36-24 halftime lead that they never fully relinquished[[ok]]. ""úCredit to Davis, they played a great game,""ù Pasternack said. ""úThey were very well-prepared. All credit goes to them.""ù Only senior guard Max Heidegger'storrid second half, which saw him score 27 of his 31 points and knock down seven 3's, kept UCSB in contention. Heidegger's explosion aside, it was a dispiriting result for a Gaucho team that had been riding a three-game win streak. On Saturday, UCSB will get the chance to bounce back from last week's loss and land a serious blow against one of the team's main Big West rivals. Thursday's game pushed UCD past the Gauchos and up to second place in the conference at 6-5 and 12-15 overall. Pasternack has been working his charges hard in practice this week in order to right the ship, and Thursday and Saturday's games will test the effectiveness of his efforts. ""úOur guys have worked extremely hard,""ù Pasternack said. ""úIt's ""ònext game.' That's the mentality. We lost a game, didn't play well. They played really well, and now it's on us to really lock in here and get ready for Thursday night.""ù The regular season is rapidly approaching its close, and the number of opportunities to move up the bracket for the Big West tournament is dwindling. The Gauchos get two opportunities this week to make a move up the standings and avenge a pair of losses ""î opportunities the team likely can't afford to waste.

It was a long off-season, one which featured the departures of thirteen Gauchos ""î just before the brand new lights of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium shone on grass that was once the home of Cleveland Indians starting pitcher Shane Bieber, whose rise to the top of the game has since coincided quite nicely.† Of the five seniors UCSB waved off, Kevin Chandler and Alex Patterson were the pitchers. Chandler had already spent his first two years of college ball with the Gauchos before Patterson made the switch from San Joaquin Delta College. They pitched a combined 154.1 innings for UCSB.† Outfielders Tevin Mitchell and Michael McAdoo are joined alongside catcher Thomas Rowan as the position players who have left their space for the next wave of exciting talent.† Mitchell and Rowan are both currently playing for the Gulf Coast League (GCL) Marlins, a rookie-level affiliate of the Miami Marlins.† With five seniors gone, that leaves eight, who are all playing professional baseball.† Jack Dashwood, Eric Yang and Tommy Jew all chose red.Dashwood is with the Angels, Yang is with the Reds and Jew is learning the Cardinal Way, out in a town just blistering with excitement after Jordan Binnington's masterful run with the Blues for St Louis' first cup. And they're known as a baseball town too, so it'll be nice to see him coming up in a great system with a great fanbase. Andrew Martinez, Ben Brecht and Shea Barry make up the rest of our Gauchos who have not only said goodbye to UCSB, but to California (for now at least). Martinez is with the Orioles, facing off against Mitchell and Rowan in the GCL. Ben Brecht is with Tampa Bay, playing in Hudson Valley while Shea Barry brought his ball to Houston.† And finally, the locals. Chris Lincoln got picked up by the new-look San Diego Padres, who seem to have built the perfect farm system years into A.J. Preller's reign as general manager. They look capable of providing a great network and system for Lincoln to thrive in. Armani Smith drove up the 101 just like he's done the past two years, a native of Martinez, California. He's playing for his hometown Giants.And Shane Bieber's an all-star!† So here we are, past the introduction.† The season is officially underway as UCSB has since wrapped up a three-game series last Sunday at Sacramento State 2-1, batting a measly .181 over the entire series. They returned home Monday for the debut of Caesar Uyesaka Stadium's brand new lights. It was the first night game in program history. And their bats were sizzling as they rattled off a .447 clip at the plate to give them a 17-7 win over Cal in a one-off series.† With the break just about done, UCSB will host their first home series of the season as Abilene Christian University comes to town this weekend.† The Wildcats hosted Utah Valley for a four-game series in which the Wildcats swept them 27-9 overall. They then hit the road for a one-off against TCU in which they lost 4-14.† It'll be an interesting series to say the least.† The Friday and Saturday evening games will start at 5:30 p.m. and 4 p.m., respectively. Sunday's match is set for noon, under what will hopefully be a clear sky after Saturday's current rain projection.†

UCSB comes into this next slate of games with an 8-5 overall record and has a couple of weeks left before the start of Big West play. Although the Gauchos don't have a stellar record to start off the year, their tough strength of schedule combined with wins over quality opponents make this a successful season so far. UCSB has beaten No. 2 UCLA, No. 12 Long Beach State, No. 22 San Diego State and a few other ranked opponents during this non-conference stretch of play. The Gauchoscould potentially face off against a few more top teams depending on how this weekend shapes up. The only guaranteed matchup for the Gauchos this weekend is against the No. 7 UC San Diego Tritons, who they will face this Friday.† The Tritons are off to a strong start in their 2020 campaign following last season's seventh-straight Western Water Polo Association championship run. UCSD actually made it all the way to the second round of the NCAA Tournament in 2019 before falling 14-8 to USC. This season, UCSD is 9-3 with big wins over No. 3 UC Berkeley and No. 9 UCSB as the highlights so far. The last time the Gauchos and Tritons faced off was just two weeks ago at the Triton Invitational, where a .500 shooting percentage and 10 saves by junior goalie Bennett Bugelli was enough to grind out an 11-7 victory in favor of UCSD. If UCSB wants to turn the tide in this matchup, the key will be shutting down junior center Ciara Franke. Franke currently leads the Tritons in goals (26) and has already earned a Big West Player of the Week award at the end of January. She is a lethal scorer who can rattle off shots quickly, as the Cal Golden Bears learned when she scored 5 goals in an overtime victory over them at the UCSB Invitational.† Because of the tournament format of the invitational this weekend, two out of the remaining three opponents for the Gauchos have not yet been decided. UCSB will take on either No. 1 Stanford or No. 22 San Diego State in the remaining game on Saturday depending on who wins the game between these two teams on Friday. If the Gauchos do end up facing the Cardinal, they will without a doubt be the toughest competition that UCSB plays all season. Stanford has a perfect 9-0 record this season and a stacked roster of potential olympians that are the best in the country so far. Junior driver Sarah Klass has been the leader of the team this year, she's both the active (72) and season (23) leader in goals for the Cardinal. Klass has scored multiple goals in all seven of the games that she has scored in and just received the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week award for her 5-goal output last weekend. Regardless of who UCSB faces this weekend, this invitational offers another opportunity for the team to face off against some of the top squads in the country and potentially climb up the national rankings before conference season begins. The Gauchos' first match is set to get underway at 4:15 p.m. on Friday in Irvine, and the game against either San Diego State or Stanford will start at 8 a.m. on Saturday.

Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus After yet another split last week, the UC Santa Barbara's women's basketball team (10-14, 5-6) sits in fifth place in the Big West conference ""î one game behind third-place Long Beach State, but only one game ahead of eighth-place UC Irvine. With a logjam in the middle of the standings, UCSB will need to string together a win streak if it hopes to improve its seeding for the conference tournament. This week, the Gauchos will host Cal State Northridge (CSUN) and UC Riverside (UCR) in two crucial matchups. First, the ""òChos will take on the Matadors on Thursday in a rematch of last Saturday's game ""î a 65-55 road victory for Santa Barbara. That game was in large part dominated by freshman phenom Ila Lane, who finished the game with 16 points and 17 rebounds. On defense, Lane played a key role in shutting down CSUN's leading scorer ""î senior De'Jionae Calloway, who finished the game with only 4 points on 2-12 shooting from the floor. Senior guard Tal Sahar also turned in one of her best performances of the season, chipping in 18 points off the bench for UCSB. In the fourth quarter in particular, Sahar left her stamp on the game, drilling three 3-pointers and shooting 75% from behind the arc in the quarter. Still, the Matadors were able to keep the game tight for much of the night. In particular, sophomore† guard Jordyn Jackson had an excellent night, finishing the game with 16 points on 6-9 shooting. In addition, despite a rough shooting night for CSUN's starters, the team's bench excelled all night, scoring 20 of the team's 55 points. While UCSB will have the home-court advantage this time around, don't expect Calloway to shoot 17% from the floor this time around. The Matadors will also likely double and triple-team Lane in the post this go-around, meaning the Gauchos will need a significant contribution from their backcourt on Thursday. While senior Coco Miller didn't shoot the ball particularly well on Saturday ""î finishing the game with 8 points on 3-13 shooting ""î her contributions extend far beyond her field-goal percentage. Currently, Miller ranks fourth in the country with a 3.1 assist-to-turnover ratio. Against the Matadors, Miller finished the game with 8 assists and only 2 turnovers and will need to continue that level of production and efficiency if the Gauchos are to walk away victorious on Thursday. On Saturday, UCSB will take on UC Riverside (8-16, 4-6), looking to avenge their loss from earlier this season. In that game ""î a 66-61 victory for the Highlanders ""î Lane struggled mightily with foul trouble, only logging 26 minutes on the night. Without the focal point of their offense, the Gauchos struggled from the floor, shooting only 36% on the night. This time around, UCSB will need to make a concerted effort to slow down UCR's backcourt. In the previous matchup, junior guard Keilanei Cooper roasted the ""òChos all night, finishing with 23 points on an efficient 8-13 shooting split. Most importantly, Santa Barbara needs to limit the production of redshirt senior Jannon Otto ""î who ranks second in the conference with 16.6 points per game. One of the best players in the entire conference, Otto can score from anywhere on the floor, shooting 36% from deep and 88% from the free-throw line. If the Gauchos can stay out of foul trouble and limit the production of UCR's backcourt, they should have a good chance to finish the week with a crucial victory. Riverside has struggled mightily away from home this season, with only one of the team's conference wins coming on the road. UCSB will take on Cal State Northridge on Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome, before finishing the week against UC Riverside on Saturday at 2 p.m. Comments are closed.

sports,23-4 Run Propels Gauchos Past Matadors,22-Feb-20,1:31 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-22/93021/,"Estef Zuniga / Daily Nexus The UCSB women's basketball team didn't score until 3:42 left in the first quarter on Thursday. Then, the Gauchos ripped off a 23-4 run, opening up a 17-point lead that the team would never lose en-route to a 65-60 victory over Cal State Northridge (CSUN). With the win, UCSB (11-14, 6-6) moved into a tie for fourth place with Long Beach State, while CSUN (9-16, 4-7) dropped its sixth straight conference game. In the first quarter, Santa Barbara struggled to deal with the 2-3 zone that CSUN ran ""î especially because the team's perimeter shots weren't falling. ""úAt first, we were sped up,""ù junior point guard Danae Miller said. ""úWe felt the energy coming into the game, but once we settled down, we got right into our groove.""ù Once Miller, senior guard Tal Sahar and senior guard Coco Miller each hit a 3 on consecutive possessions to stretch the zone, the ""òChos were able to get the offense going. For the most part, the Matadors did an admirable job of slowing down freshman forward-center Ila Lane on the offensive end. In one of her least efficient performances of the season, Lane finished the game shooting only 35.3% from the floor. ""úThey were physical with [Lane], so she couldn't get high-percentage catches,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. In a testament to Lane's talent and effort, however, the freshman phenom still finished the game with her 16th double-double of the season, logging 19 points and 13 rebounds on the night. During one particularly impressive moment in the second quarter, Lane launched her 6-foot-4-inch frame onto the hardwood for a loose ball. After grabbing it, Lane proceeded to run the length of the floor, finishing the play with an easy layup to give the ""òChos an 18-6 lead. While her box score wasn't overly impressive, freshman point guard Johnni Gonzalez turned in one of her finest performances of the season on Thursday. With Coco Miller in foul trouble for most of the night, Gonzalez was forced to be the second ball-handler. Displaying the tantalizing talent she has shown in brief stretches all season, Gonzalez frequently wowed teammates and the crowd with her ability to beat the full-court press. Just before the half, Gonzalez drilled a deep 3 to give UCSB a comfortable 32-15 lead heading into the locker room. In the second half, however, CSUN came storming back ""î led in large part by freshman Deja Williams and senior De'Jionae Calloway. The Matadors went on a 19-8 run to kick off the third quarter, with Williams pouring in 12 of her 20 points during the quarter. ""úWe missed a bunch of shots at the rim, and they were able to get momentum,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe need to clean that up and finish stronger.""ù With 2:14 left in the third, the Gauchos' lead had been cut to merely 6 points. Then, Danae Miller made magic happen. Three possessions in a row, Danae Miller attacked the teeth of the CSUN defense, getting a step on the perimeter and forcing her defender to panic. Three possessions in a row, Danae Miller drew a foul; with the Matadors in the bonus, that meant free throws. After making 5 of her 6 free throws, Danae Miller found Lane underneath the hoop for an easy layup, opening up a 47-36 lead for the team at the end of the quarter. In total, Danae Miller finished the game with 21 points, 4 assists, 5 rebounds and an eye-boggling 7 fouls drawn. While the Matadors kept the pressure on in the fourth, with Calloway chipping in 8 of her 18 points in the quarter, the team was unable to overcome the deficit. CSUN was able to cut the lead to 3 with 10 seconds left, but Gonzalez hit 2 clutch free throws to ensure the ""òChos came away with the crucial victory. Now, UCSB must turn its attention to UC Riverside, who knocked off the Gauchos 66-61 earlier this season. Santa Barbara takes on UC Riverside at 2 p.m. on Saturday at the Thunderdome.

sports,Gauchos Continue Big West Surge With Wins Over Titans and Aggies,24-Feb-20,1:05 PM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/gauchos-continue-big-west-surge-with-wins-over-aggies-titans-and-aggies/,"Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus After a loss to UC Davis last week dropped the UCSB men's basketball team from second to fourth place in the Big West and snapped their three-game winning streak, the team faced a turning point in their season this week. With two games on the docket, the first on Thursday at Cal State Fullerton and the second being a home rematch on Saturday against UC Davis, the Gauchos had the opportunity to bounce back and improve their positioning in the conference standings. UCSB took that opportunity and swept the week with a 75-66 win over the Titans and a 70-56 victory over the Aggies.† The two wins pushed the Gauchos' record to 18-9 this season and 7-5 in conference play. That conference mark is good enough for second in the Big West, a half-game ahead of UCD and three-and-a-half behind UC Irvine. The Gauchos seemed determined to make the most of their opportunity immediately on Thursday evening. UCSB opened the game on an 11-0 run in the first three minutes, with graduate transfer forward Matt Freeman contributing 7 of the points. ""úMatt Freeman had a monster first four minutes of the game,""ù UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úThat really got us going.""ù Bloodied as they were by the Gauchos' opening volley, the Titans showed no sign of quitting on their home court. Slowly and surely, Fullerton dragged their way into contention, at one point narrowing the UCSB lead to 2 points and went into the locker room down by 34-29. The Gauchos maintained their advantage for the much of the second half but were unable to reopen their lead into the double-digits. Fullerton kept on hanging around, waiting for the opportunity to make their move. That opportunity finally presented itself just after the eight-minute mark of the second half. The Titans stitched together the right combination of buckets and stops and took a 56-55 lead, their first of the game, with 7:34 to go. Baskets from each of Fullerton's top three players ""î senior forward Jackson Rowe, graduate transfer guard Brandon Kamga and senior guard Austen Awosika ""î pushed the Titan lead to 63-59 with 5:40 left and forced UCSB onto its back foot. The Gauchos responded to the reversal of fortunes with vigor. UCSB closed out the game on a 16-3 run for the 75-66 victory, giving the game a symmetrical appearance with Gaucho runs to open and close the proceedings.† Senior guard Max Heidegger scored 8 of UCSB's final 16 points and finished with a game-high 27 points. Heidegger also pulled down 7 rebounds and passed out 5 assists, making for a well-rounded performance.† Heidegger's 7 boards tied him with junior guard Devearl Ramsey for a team-high rebound count. Neither Heidegger, at 6'3""ù, or Ramsey, at 6' even, have anything resembling a height advantage on the glass, but both guards found a way to find the ball. Thursday's matchup was the first between UCSB and Fullerton this season, giving the Gauchos their first chance to take on the team that knocked them out of the Big West Tournament last season. While the Titans are a much different team this season than they were last year, the element of revenge likely made the win just a little sweeter for UCSB. Revenge was also at play on Saturday night against UC Davis. The Aggies came into the Thunderdome on a four-game winning streak, including an 84-75 win over UCSB last Thursday. The Gauchos came out of the gate looking like a team intent on vengeance ""î perhaps a little too intent. UCSB committed 6 turnovers in the first eight minutes of the game, enabling UCD to jump out to an early 14-6 lead. ""úI feel like we were just a little anxious,""ù Ramsey said. ""úWe just wanted to get out there and play really hard and we just had to channel our energy in the right way.""ù It took a few minutes, but the Gauchos eventually managed to settle down and stop giving the ball away. Once that happened, UCSB was able to chip away, slowly but surely, at the Davis lead with good defense and some solid interior play by sophomore forward Amadou Sow.† A tip-in by junior guard Brandon Cyrus and a jumper by Heidegger brought the Gauchos within 2 points of the Aggies and forced UCD Head Coach Jim Les to call a timeout with 7:15 left in the half. That timeout did nothing to stop the Davis slide, however. The Aggies turned the ball over immediately out of the timeout and suddenly, Ramsey† was everywhere. The point guard knocked down a 3, made a layup and knocked down another 3, all in the span of about 70 seconds.† ""úMy teammates were just finding me, and in transition, I'm always going to try to push the pace,""ù Ramsey said. ""úAmadou had me on the skip [pass] and Max had me on the skip [pass]; those guys got me and I just hit my shots.""ù Ramsey's one-man run pushed UCSB into the lead with 5:28 to go in the first half and energized the Thunderdome crowd. Freeman knocked down 2 free throws a few minutes later to make the score 31-21, but a couple of scores by Aggie senior guard Joe Mooney cut the deficit to 31-26 going into the locker room. Neither the Gauchos nor the Aggies were able to break away from the other for most of the second half. UCSB held onto their lead, but UCD managed to answer seemingly every basket or stop with one of their own. With just under seven minutes left, the Gauchos managed to stitch together another run ""î their first real spurt of the half. After UC Davis freshman guard Ezra Manjon knocked down 2 free throws to cut the lead to 54-50, UCSB worked the ball inside: big man Sow scored twice and Heidegger flipped in a layup to push the lead to double digits for the first time in the half.† Les immediately called a timeout and, unlike his earlier timeout, this one managed to flip the momentum, at least for a little bit. Junior forward Kennedy Koehler scored 3 straight times† to bring his team back within 4 points of the lead, putting some serious pressure on the Gauchos. UCSB responded with overwhelming force. Heidegger struck back first with a deep 3 from straightaway, and it was all Gauchos from there. Koehler's last layup in his personal mini-run was UC Davis' last point of the night, and it came with 4:18 left on the clock. The Aggies were wholly unable to get a bucket from that point on, while UCSB poured on 10 straight points to close out the 14-point win. While the end of regulation wasn't particularly exciting, with the Gauchos holding such a commanding lead, the postgame handshake line had plenty of drama.† First, Les appeared to pass Pasternack without a handshake and then yelled back at the Gaucho head coach. As Les was yelling, Mooney ran up behind Heidegger and shoved the Gaucho guard in the back, setting off a shoving match at center court that took a while to finally clear up. Pasternack didn't provide an explanation of what exactly happened, but he did have plenty of praise for Les. ""úI'm not sure [what was going on],""ù Pasternack said. ""úI think Coach Les is one of the best coaches in the country. I think he is very, very hard to beat. His teams execute as well as any team I've ever coached against in my career.""ù Heidegger led all scorers with 17 points, but Sow wasn't far behind with 16 of his own. The second-year big had 6 rebounds and 2 blocks and made his presence felt against an undersized UC Davis team. Once again, it was a guard cleaning up the boards for UCSB, but this time it was Cyrus with a team-high 8 rebounds. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin, meanwhile, led the Gauchos with 7 assists. Next up for UCSB is a Thursday matchup against UC Riverside, who is currently second-to-last in the Big West, and then a Saturday game at UC Irvine. The Anteaters sit comfortably atop the Big West at 11-2, but the Gauchos stole their crown the last time the two teams met with a 64-61 victory.

sports,No. 3 UCSB Men's Volleyball Sweeps No. 6 Pepperdine,24-Feb-20,12:12 PM,['Jesse Morrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-24/no-3-ucsb-mens-volleyball-sweeps-no-6-pepperdine/,"Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara men's volleyball team faced off against the Pepperdine Waves on Friday night in Isla Vista. Pepperdine came into Friday's match as the No. 6 team in the country with a 6-3 record, 3-1 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference matches. The host Gauchos entered the match with a 9-2 record having not played any Big West Conference games yet. This was a highly anticipated match, as both teams are having great years, and this is UCSB's first game at home in over a month. Unfortunately for Pepperdine, UCSB would come out and play at an elite level. Kicking things off in the first set, these teams were trading kills before Santa Barbara started to pull away. A 12-7 advantage for SB forced Pepperdine to call an early timeout. From this point on, the Gauchos would begin their dominating performance as they would eventually roll to a 25-19 set victory. Senior outside hitters Randy DeWeese and Roy McFarland led the way offensively for UCSB in this opening set, each picking up 4 kills. In the second set, Santa Barbara jumped out to a quick 4-1 advantage. Pepperdine managed to rally back and even take the lead at 1 point, but a horrible hitting day ruined the Waves' chances at success. The UCSB defense was dominant on Friday, holding Pepperdine to an abysmal .036 hitting percentage in that second set. Pepperdine struggled offensively for most of the match, finishing the match with only a .181 hitting percentage. Things were tied up at 21 apiece before the Gauchos scored 4 unanswered points. Santa Barbara would win this second set 25-21, securing a commanding 2-0 lead. In the third set, Pepperdine came out and played hard with their backs against the wall. The Waves had ahold of a 20-18 lead but the Gauchos did all they could to end this one in three sets. UCSB took 7 of the game's final 10 points, giving them a 25-23 set victory and a 3-0 sweep. Senior setter Casey McGarry had another huge performance picking up 40 assists in this game. He was spreading the wealth all night as several different Gauchos finished with double-digit kills. DeWeese led the way with 13 kills, senior opposite Keenan Sanders had 12 and McFarland had 10.† UCSB takes on Pepperdine again on Wednesday, this time in Malibu. Things are always a little more challenging on the road, so UCSB is going to have to play as they did on Friday. The game is at 7 p.m. and will be livestreamed on the Pepperdine men's volleyball website if you are hoping to watch. Go Gauchos!

Torra, who more than likely won't spend any amount of time outside the dugout in tomorrow's game, hosted a clinic last Saturday. His 13 punchouts almost tied the record, and he has a K/9 of 15 in his first two starts of the season. Lights. Out.† The Gauchos have outscored their opponents 46-15 on the season and are fresh off defeating ACU 2-1 in a three-game set at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.† UCSB outscored ACU 17-6 and featured nine pitchers who made scoreless appearances. Rodney Boone led the Gauchos into the series and made easy work of the Wildcats, punching out eight batters and surrendering just two hits. After just over five innings, Conner Roberts and Joshua Candau pieced together the final bits and struck out four, giving up just one hit. On the other side of the diamond, Austin Wagner started the game but gave up a three-run shot to Gaucho second-baseman Marcos Castanon in the bottom of the third, who would finish his multi-hit night with four RBIs.† Johnnie Krawietz and Austin Glaze came in relief (but each gave up runs) and UCSB would take the first game 7-0.† Game two was much of the same and included the aforementioned performance of Torra, which can pretty much sum it up.† The Gauchos won 6-1 because their pitching staff shut down the Wildcats after their third-inning glimmer of hope. UCSB hit .344, eight players got hits and three players had two hits. Alex Schrier, Jorge Arellano Jr. (although he was removed from the game after allowing a walk), Conner Dand, Charlie Adamson and Carter Benbrook all stepped on and off the mound without surrendering a run.† UCSB won the series with Saturday's win, but the third game was just as important.† Head coach Andrew Checketts handed the ball to Michael McGreevy, whose brilliance also shone in his last start against Sacramento State.† Well, he didn't disappoint.† Eight down by way of the K and McGreevy went eight, but the Wildcats cracked the code for the first time all weekend.† Conner Roberts, who had been a central figure in this cast, was hit for 4 runs, and ACU would go on to win it 5-4. There was a comeback, a 3-run comeback to be precise, but Colby Adkins would ultimately hold on for the save. UCSB will play both a one-game match against LMU and a three-game series against the University of Illinois at Chicago this week, two teams that have a combined 3-12 record. This will be the only time the Gauchos take on the Flames this season, but the match against LMU will be a part of a three-game series taking place later this season. It's looking like a little bit of a preview for both sides.† Considering Benbrook came out of the bullpen recently, it's hard to tell whether he'll start tomorrow's game. He started the game after McGreevy in the last go around but coughed up six runs. UCSB just so happened to win that game 17-7. That was the first game under the lights. Did you need another reminder? No. Is it still exciting? Yes. The Lions are 3-5 on the season and won each of those games by a combined score of 20-5. Needless to say, the Gauchos will be kicking themselves if they find that they've underestimated their opponents.† The Flames will come to town for a three-game series starting this Friday. It's a bit too early to tell who will start, but look to McGreevy and Torra for some head-spinning action.† First pitch is at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow, while Friday's game is set for 5:30 p.m.†

sports,Red-Hot Gauchos Blow Out Highlanders in Third-Straight Victory,25-Feb-20,10:22 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-25/red-hot-gauchos-blow-out-highlanders-in-third-straight-victory/,"† After defeating Cal State Northridge on Thursday, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team turned in one of its most dominant performances of the season on Saturday, blowing out UC Riverside 65-47 in front of 265 supporting fans. For the first time all season, UCSB strung together multiple conference wins in the same week. With the victories, the Gauchos (12-14, 7-6) move into sole possession of third place in the Big West Conference, while the Highlanders (8-18, 4-8) fall into eighth place. In the first matchup between these teams ""î a 66-61 victory for Riverside ""î the Highlanders' backcourt dominated for much of the game. In that game, junior guard Keilanei Cooper led the way with 23 points, while star redshirt-senior guard Jannon Otto chipped in 14 points as well. This time around, the Gauchos' perimeter defense completely nullified the two guards. On the night, Cooper finished with a mere 2 points, shooting 1-11 from the floor in one of her least efficient performances of the season. But perhaps the biggest reason for the ""òChos blowout victory was the defense of redshirt senior Coco Miller, who was tasked with the unenviable job of guarding Otto. Coming into the game, Otto ranked second in the conference with 16.6 points per game. An elite scorer, Otto has been highly efficient all year, shooting 35% from deep and 86% from the free-throw line. None of that mattered to Miller on Saturday ""î she completely nullified Otto in the first half. At halftime, Miller had collected 5 steals; in comparison, Otto had only scored 4 points on 2-7 shooting. ""úI thought [Miller] was unbelievable on defense,""ù Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson said. ""úShe stayed with Otto like velcro.""ù While Otto actually finished the game with 17 points on the night, a majority of that production came with the game well out of reach. With Otto struggling to find her footing on offense, the Riverside offense limped to only 15 points in the first half. Conversely, the Gauchos had one of their finest offensive first halves in recent memory, with the team scoring a resounding 40 points in the first half. Yet again, freshman Ila Lane demonstrated her resounding talent on Saturday, contributing 17 points and grabbing 12 rebounds en-route to her 17th double-double on the season. After the performance, Lane now leads the nation with 13.1 rebounds per game on the season. ""úSo much of post play is positioning; [Lane] was good early and the passes were on time and on target,""ù Henrickson said. Another player who excelled all night was freshman Johnni Gonzalez. While the stat sheet won't reflect her overall impact, Gonzalez helped to control the tempo of the ""òChos offense all night ""î especially when junior guard Danae Miller left with an injury. In total, Gonzalez finished the game with 8 points on 3-6 shooting, including a deep buzzer-beater 3-pointer that gave the ""òChos a 25-point lead at the half. Senior guard Tal Sahar also continued her recent hot streak on the offensive end, scoring 16 points off the bench on Saturday. In one of the most impressive plays of the entire game, Sahar hit a dream-shake fadeaway jumper that gave UCSB a 54-25 lead in the third quarter. While Riverside chipped away at the Gaucho's lead in the fourth quarter, it was ultimately a story of too little, too late for the Highlanders. For the first time all season, UCSB sits in sole possession of third place in the conference after winning its third straight game on Saturday. Next, the Gauchos travel to Cal Poly on Wednesday, looking to sweep their rivals. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.

The Gaucho win pushed Pacific's bleak record to 1-7, marking its fifth loss since the first of February.† The team carried that momentum into Sunday's match, knocking down University of San Francisco 6-1. Consequently, USF's record fell to 4-5 on the season.†† For what seems like the first time this season, the Gauchos demonstrated poise and consistency, allowing them to maintain control over each of their opponents. Over the course of the two matches, Santa Barbara did not let one singles match drop. Against Pacific, five out of six of the Gauchos even secured their matches in just solid two-set victories. Santa Barbara continued its one-man dominance against the Dons, sweeping on all six courts.† Head Coach Marty Davis made a hopeful change to his lineup, placing sophomore Wilhelm Saiga on the No. 5 court over teammates Luka Vukmanovic and Alex Soto. Saiga closed out the day with a competitive two-set match. He pulled out a 7-5 tiebreaker win to secure the first set and then successfully stomped out his opponent with a 6-4 victory in the second. The next day, Saiga clinched the win for SB against USF with a three-set 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory.† Junior Joseph Rotheram set the pace for the Gauchos' uninterrupted winning streak after he took down Pacific's Nathan Hampton 6-0, 6-2 in the No. 4 spot. A steady presence on court four, Rotheram came out of the weekend going 2-0 on his own.† Victor Krustev took his match to a tiebreaker set after losing the first 2-6, coming out on top with an overall 2-6, 6-1, 2-0 triumph. The junior came out on top after battling his USF competitor to a tie-breaking point in the second set.† Perhaps even more crucially, Santa Barbara's doubles partners finally showed up to play. Versus Pacific, an initial win from senior-sophomore pairing Joseph Guillin and Alejandro Vedri and senior-freshman duo Alex Soto and Joshua Williams secured the doubles point first thing of the day. Consequently, Krustev and Rotheram's match was left unfinished, though they held the advantage 5-2 at the call.† Vedri and Guillin, back on court two, were responsible for the lone doubles win in Sunday's match. Soto and Williams attempted to follow it up, but a penalty point for unsportsmanlike conduct put a nail in their coffin, finishing with a 6-3 score.†† Now entering the last leg of their non-conference matches, the Gauchos finally seem to be finding their way. Santa Barbara now looks ahead to their next match on Sunday, where they will face San Diego State.†

The Gauchos come into this series with a 6-2 record, while the Flames are still searching for their first victory after seven straight losses to start off their season. One of keys to victory this weekend for UCSB will be to maintain their consistency on the mound, as both sophomore Michael McGreevy and junior Zach Torra have been lights out so far this year. McGreevy leads the team in innings pitched so far (14.2) and his miniscule .61 ERA is good for third on the squad. He has won one of the two games he's started this season, and he arguably turned in a better performance in the match where he didn't earn a win due to a late-game collapse by the bullpen. The sophomore went 8 innings without allowing a single run before the Gauchos gave up 5 in the last inning, and he also notched 8 strikeouts to go along with just 1 walk. Torra has been even better in his third season with the team, earning a National Collegiate Player of the Week award for his torrid start to the year. He leads the team in strikeouts (20) and has racked up an insane 15 K/9 (strikeouts/9 innings) . The lefty will most likely take the mound for one of the three games this weekend, and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) seems like a great team to help inflate his already great stats. Although the Flames have had a tough start to their 2019-20 campaign, they have already faced off against two top-ten opponents in No. 8 Auburn and No. 4 Vanderbilt. UIC has been outscored by a staggering 55 runs in its first seven games against these two squads, so the team will definitely be coming into this matchup starved for some positive momentum. There really aren't too many positives for the team at the moment. UIC is batting an abysmal .162 on the year while giving up a .369 batting average to its opponents, which is music to the ears of the explosive Gaucho batters. A lone bright spot has been the solid play of redshirt sophomore Ben Tharp, who leads the team with a .333 batting average on the year. UCSB is riding high early on in its Big West title defense season, but this next slate of games has all the makings of a trap series. The Gauchos are facing off against a team that is hungry for its first win, but if they keep up the intensity they've played with so far, they should be able to earn their third-straight series victory.

sports,UCSB Looks To Protect Big West Standing During Final Road Trip,26-Feb-20,5:03 AM,['Spencer Ault'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-02-26/ucsb-looks-to-protect-big-west-standing-during-final-road-trip/,"Leonard Paulasa / Daily Nexus Three-and-a-half games behind UC Irvine for first place in the Big West, a half-game ahead of UC Davis for second and with just four games left in the regular season, the name of the game now for the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team is protecting its seeding heading into the Big West Tournament. Winners of five of their last six games, the Gauchos appear poised to do just that. The team will have to learn from its early-season mistakes, however. UCSB entered Big West play on a similar roll, but saw a six-game winning streak melt away into a 2-4 conference record. These Gauchos know the importance of not coasting or resting on past success, and that their knowledge will be tested this week. First up on the schedule is UC Riverside on the road on Thursday, followed by an away game at league-leader UC Irvine on Saturday. UCSB has already beaten both teams in close games at the Thunderdome.† UC Riverside is 15-14 overall and 5-8 in conference play, which has the team second-to-last in the Big West. The Highlanders fell 65-63 to the Gauchos in a late January† thriller that saw senior guard Max Heidegger drill a go-ahead three with 2.9 seconds remaining in the game. Heidegger† has been flying high as of late, along with his team. The senior won Big West Player of the Week honors for his play last week, as he averaged 22 points and 4.5 rebounds and assists per game in UCSB's wins over Cal State Fullerton and UC Davis.†† UCR has seen middling success overall, but they've been a different team at home. The Highlanders are 10-4† in the Student Recreation Center Arena in Riverside and fell just 4 points short of a home upset against UC Irvine earlier this month.† ""úThey had Irvine beat,""ù UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úThey were up 7 with about 4 points to go at home versus Irvine. They're really good at home. We went there last year and got beat. It's a tough place to play.""ù UC Riverside plays at an agonizingly slow pace, the 12th slowest in the country according to Fox Sports, which helps explain its last-place position in the Big West for points per game and first-place position for points allowed per game. UCSB, however, isn't much faster at 17th slowest in the country but yet still manages to be fourth in the conference in points per game. ""úThey're the ninth-slowest team in our league [out of 9],""ù Pasternack† said. ""úThey grind it out and it's a grind every single game against them.""ù Big benches are often the province of up-tempo teams, but UCR bucks that trend with 12 out of 13 rostered players playing at least 10 minutes per game. UCSB, on the other hand, plays only nine of its 12 players double-digit minutes per game.† The Highlanders don't just have a big bench; they've got big players, too. Sophomore center Callum McRae is the biggest at 7'1""ù, but redshirt sophomore big-man Angus McWilliam† and redshirt junior forward Arinze Chidom both clock in at over 6'9""ù themselves.† ""úThey're a big, big team,""ù Pasternack† said. ""úThey do a great job of game-planning and scouting [""¶] We're going to have to do a great job, all five players, of rebounding.""ù To combat UCR's size, Pasternack† plans to play Gaucho sophomore forward Amadou Sow and junior forward Robinson Idehen at the same time on Thursday. That's been a rare sight so far this season and could take some getting used to. UCSB last faced UCR during a low point in their season, after losing three straight games in early Big West play. The Gauchos played from behind for almost all of that first game, but the team's recent success suggests Thursday could be a different story. After UC Riverside, UCSB takes on UC Irvine in a marquee Big West matchup.† The crown jewel of the Gauchos' current string of wins is a 64-61 victory over the Anteaters on Feb. 8,† a game Irvine likely hasn't forgotten. UCSB won that game despite blowing a 41-24 second-half lead in front of their home crowd. UCI roared back from the deficit to take a 58-55 lead late in the game, but the Gauchos managed to right the ship and close out their conference rivals. A similar performance on Saturday probably won't cut it against a team that has been almost unbeatable on its home court. The Anteaters are 10-1 in Irvine, the one loss an upset at the hands of Cal Baptist early in the season.† In conference play, UCI has lost to only UCSB and Long Beach State and has won its last four games heading into a Thursday matchup with last-place Cal Poly.† A win on Thursday will clinch the regular-season title for the Anteaters. UCI is second best in the Big West in points scored and points allowed per game, which is always a deadly combination. As the Feb. 8 game showed, the Anteaters' overall strength means they're never really out of contention in any game. The Anteaters have three players averaging at least 12 points per game: redshirt sophomore forward Collin Welp, senior guard Evan Leonard and senior point guard Eyassu Worku. Welp averages 6 rebounds a game, while Worku† hands out a team-best 3.9 assists per game. A win on Saturday will be a difficult task for the Gauchos, but they have already proved that they are capable of it this season. UCSB's case will be greatly aided if the team manages to avoid another massive second-half collapse. Beating UCR will help solidify the Gauchos' second-place standing in the Big West and beating UCI will give the team a burst heading into the postseason. Two wins will send a strong message to the rest of the conference that this UCSB team is ready to play deep into March. The Gauchos travel to Riverside to take on the Highlanders on Thursday at 7 p.m. and then swing over to Irvine to play the Anteaters on Saturday, also at 7 p.m.†

Key stifled the Gauchos all the way until junior Gianni Bloom's sac-fly would score junior Jason Willow in the seventh inning.† Sophomore Steele Ledford, whose single to the right side had moved Willow over to third, would then score on an error, giving the Gauchos a 2-1 lead.† Chicagoan Joshua Figueroa then hit a shot off Boone in the eighth to tie it back up at 2.† Boone would finish the night with 7.1 innings tossed, 3 hits, 2 runs, 1 walk and a career-high 12 strikeouts.† Come the tenth inning, Head Coach Andrew Checketts would look to freshman Vogt with 2 outs against the Gauchos to drive home sophomore Christian Kirtley. It was a hit-and-run with Willow just prior, though, and Vogt was tasked with putting the ball in play just after junior Marcos Castanon singled to give the Gauchos runners at first and second base. There was 1 out.† Willow grounded out to short, but the execution of the hit-and-run was nothing short of spectacular, and UCSB now had runners on first and third for the young man out of Woodland, California.† Vogt lined a single up the middle for a walk-off win over the Flames.† What Vogt really did, however, was open the can of worms that was the UCSB offense. The Gauchos won both of the next two games with a combined score of 25-1, completing the sweep over UIC.† The Gaucho pitching staff, despite how remarkably committed and motivated the lineup is, has just been a bit more consistent.† UCSB's offense has a low/high record of 1 and 17 runs, respectively, while their pitching staff has surrendered a low/high of 0 and 7. UCSB has given up two runs or less in eight of their eleven games thus far.† And for that reason, it can be quite interesting to analyze what exactly it is that sparks the hitting bug. Where does it come from? Why is it contagious? The Gauchos did something pretty special in game three, but more on that later.† On Saturday, the Flames tasked Bobby Nicholson with leading the charge as they sought redemption for Friday night's fiasco.† Gaucho junior Zach Torra continued his torrid form with 12 punchouts and a shutout, making for 25 strikeouts in his last two starts.† It was UCSB's third shutout of the season and they can credit their well-roundedness for that.† The Gauchos scored 10 runs off a .250 clip with 10 RBIs and an almost even K/BB ratio at 6/8. Sophomore first-baseman Kyle Johnson and Castanon both had multihit performances, including a 5-RBI day for Castanon.† UCSB topped UIC 10-0 to take the series with a game to play.† Sunday was more of the same, as the Gauchos steamrolled the Flames to a 15-1 pounding that saw UCSB bat around in the seventh inning. They rolled out 15 batters en route to a victory that sent a message: They're here, and they're here to play.† The Gauchos have stomped their opponents and made them look silly in the box, held out for the one-run games, hit a walk-off, have won in extras and so much more. They've played small ball, and they've looked like a modern MLB team, such as in this final game.† Kirtley and Vogt continued their fine weekends and each accounted for 2 more Gaucho RBIs, with shortstop McClain O'Connor contributing the final knock.† UCSB will have a short rest as top-10 UCLA comes to town on Tuesday night.

Now, with two losses in their first two games, the Gauchos will look to redeem themselves against Santa Clara (0-2) in this weekend's tournament. Unfortunately, Santa Barbara started the new year dropping matches against Oregon and Washington. Just this past Monday, the team went down 3-4 to University of Washington, a loss which was albeit an improvement over their initial 0-4 loss to Oregon over the weekend.† Santa Clara, like Santa Barbara, has yet to post a win since the new year. Against Pepperdine, the team was unable to take control of a single match, resulting in a 5-0 sweep for the undefeated Waves. In their next game versus Loyola Marymount University, sophomore Santiago Hinojosa and freshman Mann Shah supplied Santa Clara's only two victories. Here, Shah took control of the fourth court, swiping a win away from his opponent with clean, back-to-back 6-1 victories. It is possible that after suffering losses on the road, each team is missing the comfort and advantage of their home courts. The NCAA Kick Off Weekend National Indoors tournament will continue to test the two programs as both Santa Clara and Santa Barbara head to Los Angeles to face one another. A much-needed Gaucho victory, however, will undoubtedly require some recalibration. In light of the inevitable loss of dominant alumni like All-American Nicolas Moreno de Alboran and Anders Holm, Head Coach Marty Davis prospectively sought out ways to readjust the roster heading into the new season.† He successfully snatched New York-based freshman Joshua Williams, a promising four-star recruit with regional and national recognition among the tennis community. On the other hand, junior Amit Batta, a transfer out of University of Washington, is adding his D1 collegiate experience to the roster. Texas A&M transfer Alejandro Vedri also joined the lineup, already earning game time in the early season.† In the Gauchos' first games of 2020, however, Coach Davis tapped into the depths of his returning roster. The integration of sophomores like Luka Vukmanovic and Wilhelm Saiga, each of whom hardly saw the courts last season, perhaps demonstrates Davis's attempts to configure a new and dynamic starting lineup. Vukmanovic and Saiga each contributed wins in their respective doubles and singles matches despite the greater team's defeat. In singles, Saiga took three sets to take down his Washington opponent to close out the unfruitful day. Vukmanovic, paired with senior Alex Soto on court three, beat Saiga's same opponent in the second match of the day.† Trusted players like Joseph Guillin and Joseph Rotheram fell short to dominant players on opposing rosters. In doubles play, Davis has so far partnered Guillin with Vedri, a switch from last year's play in which the Frenchman predominantly doubled with junior Victor Krustev. The present pair has produced mixed results, being defeated while in Oregon but coming out victorious in a 6-4 competition in Washington.† However, it is imperative not to undermine the fact that Guillin invariably shines among fellow nationally ranked collegiate players and that it seems that Santa Clara does not statistically have an equivalent.† Nonetheless, the Broncos' Hinojosa has kept up a strong and steadfast presence over his two years in the Bay. Hinojosa spent his freshman year dominating court six, finishing his singles season with only one loss and going 11-1. So far, Hinojosa has produced one of just two match wins since 2020 for his team.† Determined to finally tally a victory onto their record, UCSB and Santa Clara will compete this Saturday at 10 a.m., and viewers can tune in live to stream the game online.†

The quartet's performance on the court ""î despite assuming new roles on it, as with DeWeese ""î reflected the seniors' skills and experiences as individual players and as teammates.† The Gauchos' weekend closed with a match versus McKendree (1-2 overall), in which they swept the Illinois roster with set scores of 25-19, 25-17 and 25-16. UCSB's showing undoubtedly destabilized McKendree's lineup, whose bleak presence was overshadowed by a seasoned Santa Barbara roster. With a steady flow of kills and a consistent system of defense across the UCSB starters, the team never dropped their lead throughout all 3 sets. In a bold experimental lineup, Head Coach Rick McLaughlin tested Haotian Xia as an outside hitter and Roy McFarland as an opposite. The sophomore-senior corners took control of the offense, each contributing 10 kills. Senior McGarry also topped SB with 5 digs.† Sophomore Brandon Hicks executed a successful 8 kills out of 9 total attempts, finishing the game with the highest kill percentage of the day at .889. Hicks backed up his offensive performance with 3 block assists.† This last game, however, was only the culmination of a rolling victory wave that had begun two days prior. In its opening match, UCSB faced Concordia-Irvine, who, in retrospect, posed the first and really only threat to their reign. Concordia fought back after their first 2 set defeats, pushing the third, though unsuccessfully, to an ultimate 24-26 loss. The game record played out favorably for the Gauchos as follows: 25-15, 25-16, 26-24. Here, DeWeese made his 2020 debut as the Gauchos' outside hitter, stepping away from his usual position as a setter. 14 kills later, the Sacramento native's undeniable performance proved his seamless transition to his new spot.† Fellow seniors McFarland and Sanders backed up DeWeese's intimidating presence, each racking up 7 kills apiece (with Sanders reaching a .700 kill percentage). Yould would earn a large part of his All-Tournament title here with an impressive 8 digs.† McGarry matched his teammate's 8 digs in the Gauchos' second game against Benedictine University, his highest dig count out of the three games. The Manhattan Beach local, named as well to the All-Tournament Team, finished the invitational with 17 total digs and an overall standout coverage of the court.† The skill-packed, nationally-ranked Santa Barbara lineup was hardly a relief for the Benedictine Redhawks, who had come off of a loss against No. 5 Cal State Long Beach the day before. The Gauchos again swept Benedictine Mesa with ease, winning 25-12, 25-21, 25-18. Here, sophomore Ryan Wilcox stood out with 15 kills, the highest number among the team over the course of the weekend. Though the Gauchos avoided more threatening competitors like Long Beach, they nonetheless will be bolstered by their electric debut. Their consistency across the board will be crucial as they look to the near future where the team will face increasingly more challenging opponents such as Stanford, USC and UC Irvine. For now, the team is preparing to take on Purdue Fort Wayne and Ball State this upcoming weekend.††

sports,No. 8 Gauchos To Kick Off Conference Play On Saturday,5-Mar-20,1:47 PM,['Omar Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-05/no-8-gauchos-to-kick-off-conference-play-on-saturday/," The No. 8 UC Santa Barbara women's water polo team will head south on Friday for its last two non-conference matchups before returning home Saturday to kick off Big West play. The Gauchos will take on a pair of Claremont Colleges, the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Athenas† and Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens, before facing off against the Cal State Northridge Matadors. This weekend offers a bit of a respite for UCSB who has been running through a gauntlet of tough teams so far this year. Santa Barbara owns a 9-8 overall record on the season and has lost three consecutive matches, all of which have been against top-10 teams. Claremont-M-S has had a roller coaster of a season so far, losing four out of its five first games before putting together a small two-game win streak leading up to Friday's game.† Santa Barbara native Aracelia Aldrete leads the Athenas in scoring (7) but there are five other players who have scored 6 goals a piece, showing just how well-distributed this team's offense is. UCSB will have to put in a team effort on defense in order to stop this squad, as Claremont's unselfishness is a little bit different than the more concentrated offenses the Gauchos have played over the last couple weeks. UCSB will face off against Pomona-Pitzer on Friday as well, which will be a nice chance to build up some momentum before the conference opener against CSUN. The Sagehens are 3-6 so far this season, and big losses against No. 2 UCLA (2-21) and No. 10 UC San Diego (7-17) indicate that they have a lot to work on defensively. Look for Gaucho senior utility Sarah Snyder to be in attack mode as she gets a break from the top defenses that she's had to face over the last few weeks. The last game of the weekend for the Gauchos will also be the most important, as the No. 21 CSUN Matadors come to campus pool for UCSB's first conference matchup of the season. The Matadors are 13-5 so far this season but have been on a roll lately, winning six out of their last seven matches. The key for UCSB will be locking down senior utility Jennalyn Barthels, who has already notched a team-leading 32 assists. Barthels is coming off a career season where she scored 39 goals to go along with 37 assists and an All-Big West Honorable Mention. She does it all for the Matadors, so if the Gauchos are able to limit her touches they should have a great chance of limiting the team's offense as a whole. After a tough non-conference schedule, UCSB women's water polo will finally be getting into the heart of their season this weekend. Two matchups against struggling teams on Friday, Claremont-M-S and Pomona-Pitzer, should be a breath of fresh air for the Gauchos before plunging right into Big West play on Saturday.† Comments are closed.

The Gauchos are coming off a one-game match at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium against the visiting nationally ranked UC Los Angeles Bruins, in which UCSB's 8-5 victory was UCLA's first loss of the season.† It was a nail-biter under the lights as junior pitcher Conner Roberts threw four almost-perfect innings in relief of freshman starter JD Callahan, who was tacked for four runs in four innings.† Sophomore infielder Christian Kirtley and sophomore catcher Mason Eng had multihit performances and RBIs, while a late ninth inning push from the Bruins was nothing more than that for junior pitcher Conner Dand, who would go on to finish out the ninth and game.† The Gauchos now sit 10-2 on the season as they prepare for a tough road match against a program that over doubles UCSB's silverware.† At 5-6, the Beavers are starving for the complimentary pieces needed to support their older cast of players, such as senior infielder Andy Armstrong and junior catcher Troy Claunch.† Oregon State's season has been so inconsistent that the one thing that potentially makes them consistent is that they are inconsistent. Seven of their 11 games have ended with a run differential of +4 or higher, while three of those ended with a +6 or higher.† In their most recent game, they lost 11-12 in a marathon at San Diego State University.† They lost 3-4 and 4-7 to Brigham Young University and Mississippi State University, respectively. That about sums it up, save for big wins like their 13-1 demolition of SDSU in the first game of this last series or their 11-4 win over University of New Mexico in the season opener.† UCSB, on the other hand, is absolutely on fire, having now won five games in a row since their 4-5 loss to Abilene Christian University.† They're 10-2 with lights-out pitching, stone cold composure and, perhaps, the deepest lineup in the conference. 
 The Gauchos own a sparkling 2.13 ERA and have shut out their opponents on three occasions. They have four players batting over .300, including junior infielder Marcos Castanon and Kirtley, while that ranking steadily declines until the bottom. The Beavers are experiencing a huge drop in their run production after Claunch, who's .275 clip at the plate is followed up by sophomore infielder Matthew Gretler's .217. Now average does not necessarily translate to runs, which is, in fact, evident by the fact that Claunch is eighth on his team in average, but is tied for the lead in home runs and RBIs. However, the eight players that own averages lower than Gretler have combined for zero home runs and have failed to match his four RBIs. This means that Gretler is, indeed, not an outlier. After Claunch, who has proven himself to be quite the quality player now in his third year,† the Beavers' lineup has been left out in the dust. Or the rain, I suppose""¶ Alongside Claunch, however, are junior redshirt infielder and outfielder Alex McGarry, who is the aforementioned deadlock partner at 3 bombs and 13 RBIs, the aforementioned Armstrong, who is off to a sizzling start at the dish, ready to finish off his college career strong, and junior infielder Ryan Ober, who's got 10 hits in nine games and eight starts.† While the Gaucho pitching staff should be expected to triumph over both the Beavers' lineup and ballista, there are a few gems that, if not respected enough, may shut the door on your game. That's junior pitcher and outfielder Christian Chamberlain. Three starts, 17 IP, 24 SO, 2 W and 0 ER. Dominant.† Pitchers freshman Ryan Brown, freshman AJ Lattery and junior Reid Sebby haven't been nasty, but they've been shut down relievers here in the young season.† As for the Gauchos, pitchers sophomore Michael McGreevy, junior Zach Torra and sophomore Rodney Boone have simply devastated lineups week in and week out. The report isn't out yet, but look for all three to potentially get starts this weekend.† Friday's first pitch is at 5:35 p.m., while Saturday's is 4:05 p.m. and Sunday's is 12:05 p.m

Two wins, and the Gauchos are assured the second seed in the Big West tournament and a position on the opposite side of the bracket from league-leading UC Irvine. Two losses, and UCSB will likely find itself in third or fourth place, facing a much more difficult path to the championship.† Luckily for the Gauchos, the two teams they have left to play are two of the worst teams in the Big West: Cal State Fullerton, which is 10-19 overall and 5-9 in conference play, and Cal Poly, which is 7-21 and 4-10. That scheduling luck is a bit misleading, however. Fullerton and Cal Poly do indeed reside at the bottom of the conference standings, but that just means they have more to play for. The worst team in the Big West misses the tournament entirely and the Titans and Mustangs both will do what it takes to avoid that fate. The Gauchos, then, host two hungry teams this week. First up is Fullerton on Thursday night followed by Cal Poly on Saturday night, which will also serve as Senior Night for UCSB's three departing players. UCSB defeated Fullerton on Feb. 20 in a 75-66 game that saw the Gauchos come out hot, then blow the lead, and finally regain the advantage and close out the Titans with a 16-3 run. Senior guard Max Heidegger provided much of the spark for UCSB with 27 points, 7 rebounds 5 five assists and scored 16 of the team's 41 second-half points. The Gauchos likely won't have Heidegger this time around. The senior left last Thursday's game against UC Riverside early with an ankle injury that was serious enough to keep him out of Saturday's game against UC Irvine as well. UCSB felt Heidegger's absence in their loss to UC Irvine, shooting just 36.8% from the field with only one player scoring in the double digits. Junior guard JaQuori McLaughlin handled much of the scoring load when Heidegger missed 10 games earlier this season and will likely have to take on that role again if the Gauchos are to overcome the loss of their leading scorer. Saturday's game was a tough first matchup to be without a player like Heidegger, but if the senior is indeed forced to miss more time with his injury, the competition this week promises to be a bit friendlier. Fullerton is a middle-of-the-pack defensive team in the Big West, surrendering the fourth-most points per game while holding opponents to the fourth-lowest shooting percentage in the league. The Gauchos' experience in their first matchup with the Titans bears out the statistical observations: UCSB shot a solid 45.6% from the field and scored 75 points, both fairly typical totals for the team this season. On offense, Fullerton has two of the top five scorers in the Big West in senior guard Brandon Kamga and senior forward Jackson Rowe. Kamga and Rowe combined for 38 of the Titans' 66 points in their first game against UCSB and will almost certainly be the Gauchos' top defensive priorities once again on Thursday. Fullerton comes into Thursday's game as losers of their last three games and have slid perilously close to last place Cal Poly in the Big West standings. UCSB, on the other hand, has won six of their last eight games, so the two teams enter Thursday's game heading in opposite directions. The same can be said for Cal Poly and UCSB. The Mustangs have lost five games in a row heading into their matchup with the Gauchos, a losing streak that has kept them in the Big West cellar. UCSB and Cal Poly opened up Big West play against each other all the way back on Jan. 8, so it's only fitting that they'll close their regular season against each other almost two months later. That first matchup was a 63-45 Gaucho victory, the team's second-most lopsided win in conference play this year. Statistically speaking, there's not much that Cal Poly does especially well. The Mustangs are near the bottom of the Big West in several categories, on offense and defense, and have surrendered over 80 points six times in conference play. The Mustangs are especially weak on the boards, as opponents average 4.4 more rebounds a game than Cal Poly. That's the worst mark in the Big West and UCSB will be eager to exploit.† If Heidegger is forced to miss Saturday's game as well, it won't be much of a change for the Gauchos when it comes to playing Cal Poly. The senior guard missed the Jan. 8 matchup as well, and while the team's 63 points don't scream success, the margin of victory suggests UCSB knows how to beat Cal Poly without their leading scorer. The Mustangs have just one player averaging over 10 points per game: sophomore guard Junior Ballard. Ballard averages 12.8 points per game and shoots 36%† percent from three, enough to make him the primary focus for any team playing Cal Poly. If the Mustangs are able to reverse their slide and beat Long Beach State on Thursday night, they'll come into the Thunderdome with a potential postseason bid on the line. If not, there won't be much to play for, other than a shot at spoiling UCSB's shot at second place. The Gauchos host CSU Fullerton on Thursday night at 7 p.m. On Saturday night, the Gauchos host Cal Poly for Senior Night, also at 7 p.m.

sports,Miller's Game-Winner Propels Gauchos Into Second Place,6-Mar-20,11:28 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-06/millers-game-winner-propels-gauchos-into-second-place/," With four seconds left and the UCSB women's basketball team trailing Hawai'i by 1 point, junior point guard Danae Miller went to work. Miller grabbed the inbound pass, briefly glancing at the paint to see if freshman center Ila Lane was open before driving hard to the right. Miller created space with her left shoulder, fading back slightly and drilling a 12-foot floater just as time expired to give UCSB a 57-56 upset over Hawai'i. After the stunning victory in Hawai'i, the Gauchos (14-15, 9-7) leapfrogged the Rainbow Wahine (14-14, 8-7) into second place in the conference. Depending on how Cal State Fullerton and Hawai'i do in their games the rest of the week, UCSB can finish anywhere from second to fourth place in the Big West conference ""î a massive improvement from their eighth place finish last year. While Hawai'i entered Wednesday's game on a three-game losing streak, UCSB still entered the game as considerable underdogs, with the Rainbow Wahine a much stronger home team than away team. Still, UCSB proved from opening tipoff that it was going to hang around all night, with the team never trailing by more than one point all night. As has been the story all season, Lane put in yet another impressive outing for the ""òChos, scoring 20 points on 10-14 shooting from the floor. To their credit, the Rainbow Wahine prevented Lane from grabbing her 19th double-double of the season, limiting her to only 5 rebounds on the night. But UCSB won on Wednesday by producing one of its most efficient offensive performances of the season. The Gauchos shot 49% for the game, including 38% from deep; in total, the Gauchos scored 51 of their 57 points either in the paint or behind the arc. Despite facilitating far more than scoring this season, redshirt senior Coco Miller also carried a significant portion of the offensive load, chipping in 15 points and shooting 2-3 from deep. Nonetheless, Hawai'i kept the game competitive all night in front of its home crowd. Star senior guard Julissa Tago poured in 15 points for the Rainbow Wahine, although the Gauchos held her to 36% shooting on the night. With nine seconds to go and the Rainbow Wahine down 55-54, Tago was able to draw a shooting foul ""î converting both of her free throws to give Hawai'i an ephemeral lead. Redshirt junior Amy Atwell was the only other Rainbow Wahine player to notch double-figures on the night, with the Australian racking up 15 points on an efficient 7-9 shooting. All of that was nullified by Miller's late game heroics. Despite only scoring 9 points on the night, Miller hit one of the biggest shots of her career on Wednesday. Now, the Gauchos must wait for the rest of the conference to finish their final games. At worst, UCSB is guaranteed a bye to the second round with the fourth seed; at best, the Gauchos are looking at a double-bye with the second seed. While a multitude of permutations exist, a Hawai'i loss to Cal Poly and a Cal State Fullerton loss to UC Irvine would guarantee UCSB the second seed in the conference tournament.

sports,"UCSB Baseball Sweeps Oregon State, Pushes Win Streak to Eight",9-Mar-20,8:06 PM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-03-09/ucsb-baseball-sweeps-oregon-state-pushes-win-streak-to-eight/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Benchmark by benchmark, the UC Santa Barbara baseball team has now officially set a course soon to be ablazed by their scorching stretch of form. Going into the weekend against Oregon State, UCSB sat at 10-2, preparing for their first series match against a Pac-12 opponent. Now, they've swept the No. 25 team in the country, earned their fifth shutout of the season and have proven they're here to win.† With each one-game match and series won thus far, the Gauchos are poised to continue their destruction of opposing lineups. UCSB opened the season with a loss to Sacramento State, which looked to be nothing more than a quick dusting of the off-season cobwebs.† Fortunately for the Gauchos, it was.† They would go on to win five straight before a loss to Abilene Christian would eventually stand like an erected statue, out of place on a schedule with mostly Ws.† In fact, that was the second and last loss so far in the young season. At just a quarter of the way through, UCSB has quite firmly stamped their mark. With Beaver ace Christian Chamberlain set to kick the weekend off for the company from Corvallis, UCSB Head Coach Andrew Checketts handed the ball to sophomore sensation Rodney Boone, who would send down the first 13 batters he faced en route to his second win of the season and the sixth straight for the Gauchos.† As far as ablazing goes, you've gotta be pretty hot if you're taking down the No. 25 team's ace, especially if the guy hadn't allowed a run in 21 innings of work. The Gaucho offense would come alive in the fifth as senior McClain O'Connor would clear the bases with a 2-RBI triple. A Beaver error later in the inning would score the talented shortstop, giving UCSB a 3-0 lead.† Three more runs would come across in the eighth inning, but junior Conner Roberts and freshman Alex Schrier also came out of the bullpen.† Roberts would relieve Boone after just over five innings where he would go on to throw over two scoreless innings with four punchouts to continue his own fine work.† Schrier would give up a hit and a walk as well as strike out two players as he turned off the lights on Oregon State in game one.† Gaucho junior Zach Torra took the mound in game two against Jake Pfennigs, who has impressed early on in his second season.† Torra would go just over six, striking out seven without surrendering a single run. Like Pfennigs, Torra has impressed, but unlike Pfennigs, he's been dominant.† Aside from the relief trio of Jorge Arellano Jr., Joshua Candau and Noah Owen, who have combined for 6.2 scoreless innings, Torra has a tight grip on the team lead at 0.36. You'll also find his name at the top of the K chart, as his 39 in 25.1 innings pitched translates to an astronomical 13.86.† He's one of the guys. He's leaving nothing more than a scorched trail of broken bats and toasted seeds.† Senior Conner Dand, who's been arguably the best Gaucho reliever this season, came in just after the sixth and would close out the night for UCSB's seventh straight win and fifth shutout of the season.† Sunday's afternoon game saw sophomore Michael McGreevy take on junior Nathan Burns. It was more good news for the Gaucho offense which, again, had only 5 hits with 32 at-bats for the second game in the row. And remember, they got one hit on Friday.† McGreevy struggled more in this game than in previous starts but was somehow able to work through over five teeth-grinding innings. He would surrender 8 hits and 2 earned runs, but it was Burns, whose 8-K performance will not be remembered for heroically fending off the invaders and, for that, his composure will be tested. For McGreevy, on the other hand, when you're rolling, you're rolling. UCSB would hold on to win 3-2 and take the series with a clean sweep.† That means UCSB has swept their Pac-12 opponents 5-0 while their top-ten ERA rank could hardly have dropped after Sunday's two-run showing.

sports,Season Recap: Red-Hot Gauchos Tie for Second Place in Big West,6-Apr-20,11:31 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-06/season-recap-red-hot-gauchos-tie-for-second-place-in-big-west/,"Estef Zuniga / Daily Nexus The day before a game, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team always gathers to watch film on the upcoming opponent. Before its first 29 games, the team identified strengths and weaknesses of the opposing team, running through the game plan to make sure everyone understood their responsibilities. March 12 ""î the day before the team's 30th game ""î was no exception. The Gauchos gathered in an Anaheim conference room to scout out their Big West Conference Tournament semifinal opponent: Hawai'i. Just eight days earlier, the two teams faced off in a dramatic, nail-biting affair, with junior point guard Danae Miller's buzzer-beater giving the Gauchos the victory ""î as well as the second seed in the conference tournament. But by the time Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and her coaching staff entered the room, it was clear the team had more to talk about than the Rainbow Wahine. ""úWe were in contact with our administration, and we actually moved film back to 10:15 because conference officials were meeting at 10,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe already knew the games were going to have no fans, but all morning I watched on my phone as the Big 12, Big Ten and ACC cancelled their tournaments, thinking we were likely next.""ù Sure enough, Big West Conference officials made the decision to cancel the tournament at the 10 o'clock meeting, leaving Henrickson with the unenviable task of communicating that decision to the team. ""úFor us, it was a combination of easing their fears as much as we could, before quickly turning it around and talking about what a great finish we had and how important the seniors were,""ù Henrickson said. ""úIt was what we would normally say after the last game in a locker room, not necessarily in a room getting ready to play.""ù Understandably, the room was emotional. After winning five of their last six games, there was a real belief within the team that they could make a deep postseason run. For seniors Coco Miller, Tal Sahar and Celeste Salazar, their collegiate basketball careers were over without any warning. ""úIt was definitely disappointing once when we officially heard the news,""ù Coco Miller said. ""úWe finished in second place in conference this year, giving us two byes in the tournament, which was the best finish that the team has had in my five years of being here, so that was really exciting. We had a lot of momentum going into the tournament and we were ready to make it to the NCAA tournament this year.""ù Later that day, the NCAA officially announced the cancellation of the 2020 women's basketball tournament. Despite the sudden ending, the UCSB women's basketball team has plenty to be proud of this season. After slumping to an eighth-place finish in the Big West last season, the Gauchos were tipped to finish dead last this year in the media preseason poll. Instead, UCSB turned in one of its finest seasons in recent memory, finishing the season with a 9-7 conference record ""î good for a tie with Hawai'i for second place in the conference. On paper, there didn't seem to be much separating this year's squad from last year's, save for the addition of two freshmen. But one of those freshmen ""î 6'4'' forward-center Ila Lane ""î would go on to have arguably the most impressive freshman year in the history of the program. In her collegiate debut, Lane chipped in 15 points to help lead the ""òChos to an opening day victory over Utah Valley. In her third game, Lane recorded a 10-point, 16-rebound double-double ""î the first of the 19 total double-doubles she would record this year. In total, Lane averaged 15.3 points per game while shooting 57.6% from the floor. On the boards, however, Lane put up even flashier numbers, leading the entire nation with her 13 rebounds per game. ""úWe knew coming into the season that [Lane] had the physical attributes to be special,""ù Henrickson said. ""úShe didn't have a lot of bad habits in high school, so she got better fast. She has high expectations of herself, she's committed to doing the work and she doesn't want to disappoint her teammates and coaches. You put all of that in a bottle and shake it up ""î that's special.""ù At the end of the season, Lane earned the accolades to prove just how special her season was. When Lane was named to the Associated Press (AP) All-American Honorable Mention team, she became the fourth student-athlete in program history to be named to an AP All-American team. In addition, Lane was named the Big West Freshman of the Year, as well as a First Team All-Conference member. As good as Lane was this season, a big can only dominate if she receives good passes into the post. Enter guard Coco Miller ""î a veteran leader who led the Gauchos in scoring last season with 12.2 points per game. This year, with better offensive weapons around her, Coco Miller switched into a facilitating role. Coco Miller led the team with 4.1 assists per game and finished ninth in the country with a 2.78 assist-to-turnover ratio. A bit of a swiss-army knife, Coco Miller also led the team with 2.1 steals per games despite frequently guarding the opposing teams' best players. In a particularly memorable performance against UC Riverside, Coco Miller blanketed First Team All-Conference member Jannon Otto; at halftime, Coco Miller had more steals (5) than Otto had points (4). ""ú[Coco] checks a lot of boxes for us,""ù Henrickson said. ""úHer post-passing, her consistency ""î it's going to be very odd to start next year without her.""ù Inconsistent performances plagued UCSB at the beginning of conference play; after five games, Santa Barbara found itself in seventh place with a 2-3 record. But every time the Gauchos' season threatened to go off the rails, a different player seemed to step up and provide exactly the spark the team needed ""î especially on the road.† In Irvine, junior walk-on Mira Shulman scored a career-high 10 points off the bench, hitting two crucial 3's for the team's 65-61 victory.† In Fullerton, with Lane deep into foul trouble, sophomore Megan Ormiston provided 13 points off the bench, shooting an efficient 6-7 from the floor.† At CSUN, with the team struggling mightily on offense for most of the night, guard Sahar scored 9 fourth-quarter points to spark a late-game run.† And, of course, there was Danae Miller's game-winner in Hawaii ""î a difficult shot that underscored just how much the team was rolling to end the season. ""úWe persevered and never let the losses go to our heart and the wins go to our head,""ù Henrickson said. ""úIt was an incredibly unselfish and humble group that really figured out why we were winning and how to win.""ù That shot, unfortunately, would be the final shot any Gaucho player took this season. Alongside Lane's accolades, both Coco Miller and Danae Miller were named to the All-Big West Honorable Mention team. In addition to her late game heroics, Danae Miller finished 10th in the conference with 13.3 points per game during conference play. Still, for Henrickson, there will always be a question mark over this season, a pondering over what could have been with this group. Before the team traveled down to Anaheim for the conference tournament, Henrickson had already asked around to see where the team would potentially be seeded on selection Monday if they won the tournament. It wasn't cocky ""î there was a real belief within the team that this could be the year they made a run. ""úIt's heartbreaking for the seniors, but it's the right decision in the grand scheme of things,""ù Henrickson said. ""úIt's basketball games, not lives.""ù Unknowingly, that Hawai'i game would be the last ever collegiate game for Coco Miller, Sahar and forward Salazar. While Coco Miller expressed her disappointment with the outcome, she found a sense of closure in the way the season ended. ""úAlthough I was disappointed the way it ended, once I came to terms with our season being over and not going to the tournament, I realized that we were kind of lucky the way it ended,""ù Coco Miller said. ""úMost teams end their seasons with a loss, whether you lose in the Big West Tournament or the NCAA tournament, but because we didn't have the opportunity to play in either, we ended our season with two big conference wins. Both of the games I was surrounded by family and friends so I ended my career with the memories of those wins.""ù † † † Comments are closed.

sports,It's (Maybe) Back: What To Watch for in the Bundesliga,22-Apr-20,11:53 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-04-22/its-maybe-back-what-to-watch-for-in-the-bundesliga/," For more than a month, soccer fans have clung desperately to any semblance of soccer. The Belarusian Premier League ""î which has unwisely kept playing in the wake of COVID-19 ""î has drawn record-breaking viewership numbers. I myself was so desperate for sporting content that I sat through an entire FIFA match between England internationals Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford (spoiler: their FIFA skills are far inferior to their real-life skills). With no end in sight, I've had to get my soccer fix through patchy World Cup highlight videos, Instagram Live and copious amounts of Football Manager 2020. Needless to say, it's been rough. But finally, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday, two German minister presidents ""î Markus S√∂der and Armin Laschet† ""î expressed optimism that the Bundesliga could return May 9. While the official date will be decided later next week, it likely won't vary far from this May 9 date. Germany has been coordinated and efficient in their COVID-19 response, and just recently started opening up the country. With a plethora of tests at their disposal, playing the Bundesliga behind closed doors in the near future seems both pragmatic and possible. For those of you thinking ""úGreat, soccer is back, but who cares about the Bundesliga!?,""ù well, evidently we all do now. In case you didn't care previously, though, here's a short guide on the league to catch you up to date and help you prepare mentally for the return. † Can Anyone Catch Bayern? With nine games left in the season, perennial juggernaut Bayern Munich leads the table, four points clear of second place Borussia Dortmund and five points clear of RB Leipzig. Remarkably, Bayern is seeking their eighth consecutive Bundesliga title, although of late the Baverian giants have appeared far more mortal than in the past. Bayern sacked their previous manager, Niko Kovaƒç, in early November after a tumultuous start to the season, but under new manager Hansi Flick, the club hasn't lost any competitions since December 7. Bayern's success this year rests squarely on the shoulders of 31-year-old Polish striker Robert Lewandowski, who has bagged a remarkable 25 goals in only 23 games played. Defensively, Bayern is as solid as ever, led by Manuel Neuer ""î who seems to have rediscovered his form this season. Still, Bayern has proven their vulnerability this season, especially when Lewandowksi doesn't find the back of the net. With an away match at Dortmund remaining, the league is anything but finished. † Dortmund: The Inconsistent Challengers The last time the world saw Dortmund play, the Western German side blew a 2-1 aggregate lead to Paris Saint-Germain in the second leg of their Champions League fixture. That about sums up this Dortmund side: limitless potential, but with youth and a defense that has been shockingly leaky for a team with title ambitions. Since signing Erling Braut Haaland in the winter transfer window, Dortmund has featured one of the most lethal attacks in all of soccer. Already, the 19-year-old wunderkind has bagged nine goals for the German side, while 20-year-old Sancho has used his pace and technique on the wing to contribute 14 goals and 16 assists. With established German internationals Mats Hummels and Marco Reus in the side, talent has never been the issue. Consistency, on the other hand, has often plagued Dortmund, like in their 4-3 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in February. While the odds remain against Dortmund, don't count out one of the most explosive teams in Europe. † RB Leipzig: The Early Bloomers† While a seemingly less realistic pick to win the Bundesliga, Leipzig sit only 5 points back of Bayern for first place and 1 point back of Dortmund for second place. After a torrid start to the season, Leipzig have cooled off considerably, with draws in their last two league games. Nevertheless, this side showed the world what it can do when it dismantled Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 on aggregate in the Champions League. Star forward Timo Werner leads the front line with 21 goals in 25 games, and Austrian international Marcel Sabitzer has proved to be an admirable secondary option with 8 goals and 6 assists in the league so far. Having already played Bayern twice this season, however, it will take a collapse from the Bavarian giants for Leipzig to swoop in for the title. † The Others: Borussia M√∂nchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen It remains unlikely that either of these teams will win the title: Borussia M√∂nchengladbach sits 6 points back of Bayern and Bayer Leverkusen sits 8 points back of the leaders. However, both these teams play Bayern again this season, and therefore will play a crucial role in determining the champion. In addition, these two teams are vying against one another for the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot. By most metrics, M√∂nchengladbach have significantly overachieved this season. Led by Swiss international keeper Yann Sommer, M√∂nchengladbach's back line has been pivotal in their success this season. While M√∂nchengladbach lacks the star quality of their rivals, their attack has proved to be efficient, with French forward Alassane Pl√©a leading the team with 8 goals in 22 games. On the flip side, Bayer Leverkusen has an abundance of talent, but have yet to fully put together the performances the side is capable of. Midfielder Kai Havertz is one of the premier talents in the league, and has put together solid performance after solid performance in what is almost assuredly his final season for the side. Elsewhere, veteran Karim Bellarabi continues to shine, while 22-year-old Leon Bailey has shown glimpses of his massive potential. An injury to leading goal scorer Kevin Volland significantly dampers the potential of this team, but there are still enough pieces to vy for fourth place. † Comments are closed.

sports,"Beration, Bullying, and Intimidation: ""úThe Last Dance""ù Reveals Jordan's Problematic Leadership Style",20-May-20,9:36 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-05-20/beration-bullying-and-intimidation-the-last-dance-reveals-jordans-problematic-leadership-style/," Much like the rest of sports-loving America, my past five Sundays have consisted of a similar routine: grab a pseudo-healthy snack, plop down on the couch for two hours and immerse myself in the world of Michael Jordan. As a 21-year-old, I never got the pleasure of watching Jordan live; in fact, Jordan's retirement announcement in 1999 came on the same day I was born. (I've been told that my dad and the doctor watched the press conference together.) Still, my dad grew up in Chicago and instilled in me from an early age the G.O.A.T. status of Michael Jordan. After watching ""úThe Last Dance,""ù a 10-hour Jordan documentary, it's difficult to disagree with that notion. Between the abundance of clutch shots, jaw-dropping athleticism and, of course, six rings in eight years, it's easy to see why so many people crown Jordan as the greatest basketball player ever. But amid this greatness, the documentary also exposed a dark underbelly ""î an underbelly that, to me, largely overshadowed Jordan's accomplishments. In every single episode, we saw shots of Jordan berating, intimidating and bullying his teammates. At one point, we even hear about Jordan literally punching Chicago Bulls teammate Steve Kerr. It's easy to excuse these actions as ""úthe cost of winning,""ù which is what Jordan himself essentially states at the end of Episode 7. To me, that's a gross oversimplification. Michael Jordan is possibly the most talented, hard-working basketball player in the history of the game ""î he's the exception, not the rule. This leadership style worked for Jordan because of his talent and determination, but I would argue that the Bulls won in spite of Jordan's leadership rather than because of it. Even if you believe Jordan's leadership willed the Bulls to six championships, it's impossible not to look at the detrimental effects of his style. In the 90's, ads aired that told people to ""úBe like Mike.""ù Young children were taught that this alpha, brash mentality was needed to become a champion. The problem? No one else in the world has Michael Jordan's talent. I've seen the effects of this misconception my entire life. Growing up playing competitive soccer, our best player and self-appointed captain made it a point to berate players for their mistakes. Unfortunately, this leadership style doesn't work for everybody. I remember games where I would play scared, afraid to make a mistake and receive the shouting and cursing that would follow ""î instead of playing to succeed, I was playing to not screw up.† Even when this player would offer legitimate critiques to my game, I would tune him out, associating any feedback with his demeaning words. To be clear, we were a relatively mediocre team, and this player was far closer to Jordan's Bulls teammate Bill Wennington than to Jordan himself. Coming from him, criticisms rang hollow far more often than not. It's also important to point out that more compassionate leadership styles have a proven track record of success in the NBA. Tim Duncan, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki ""î the list goes on and on. These are players who have held their teammates accountable, but did so in a way that encouraged them rather than deterred them. One of my favorite parts of playing volleyball in high school was the emphasis on positivity ""î a stark contrast from basically every other sport I played. Our program even had a rule: no negative comments. Unsurprisingly, our teams consistently overachieved. What our teams lacked in talent, we made up for in attitude and an all-for-one, one-for-all approach. So yes, applaud Jordan for his heroics, for his accomplishments, for his determination and for his resolve. It's highly unlikely that any other player will win six rings in eight years ever again. †But don't praise Jordan's self-aggrandizing, intimidation-based leadership, or excuse it as ""úthe cost of winning.""ù In doing so, we encourage people to adopt a problematic, bully-esque style of leadership.
Print Playing for NBA championships is a little different than kids soccer buddy""¶ grown men respond to leadership differently GOAT status? You're a moron. Please do journalism a favor and don't ever write another article ever again. Hey Brandon ""ì I loved the article. As a former D1 and professional basketball player, all of these things you mentioned run true. The myth of the greatness of Michael Jordan is much stronger (if not eclipsing) than the ability for people to critique his shortcomings. In the eyes of American exceptionalism, he fits the typical mold of who our leaders have always fallen for, even if there is a way to get the same result without the friction. Continue to follow your gut in speaking on topics like these, it takes a real leader to write this.

sports,Season Recap: Baseball Season Cut Short After 13-2 Start,3-Jun-20,10:21 AM,['Nick DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-03/season-recap-baseball-season-cut-short-after-13-2-start/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus The NCAA announced on March 12, 2020, the cancellation of all sports around the country, an unprecedented move brought about by the widespread COVID-19 virus. Losing a school-record 10 players to the Major League Baseball draft upon the completion of the 2019 season, UCSB Head Coach Andrew Checketts admitted to baseball equipment company Easton that he really didn't know what to expect. But throughout the short season, the team bursted out the gates, the pitchers threw strikes, the lineup hit hard and they did it all when it mattered. And speaking of that Checketts interview, it seems the gaffer has been doing well enough to take the time for some virtual interviews. Easton's Instagram is where you'll find the coach talking a bit more about everything to do with Gaucho baseball and, of course, a little bit about how social distancing has played a role in all of this. Unfortunately for Easton, Zach Torra hadn't quite yet become the seventh Gaucho to be named All-American under Checketts by the time of that interview. Yeah, by the way, Torra is the seventh All-American Gaucho of the Checketts era. Announced just a few days ago, Torra was named to the 2020 Collegiate Baseball Division I All-American Third Team after simply dazzling his way to a 0.36 ERA over 25.1 innings pitched. He went on to strikeout 39 of the 83 batters he faced while holding the opposition to a measly .133 batting average. A 3-0 record on the season, Torra held opponents scoreless in three of his four starts, surrendering just a single run. Torra's most impressive showing, perhaps, came on leap day when he struck out 12 batters over seven scoreless innings en route to a 10-0 series victory over the University of Illinois at Chicago. And for the cherry on top, Torra's 39 Ks was good enough to beat most in the Big West. In other NCAA news, the organization's council has voted to approve the addition of an extra year of eligibility for all students whose seasons were impacted by the coronavirus epidemic.† While much can be left to be desired from the 2020 season, nothing will come. However, this is great news to hear as student athletes around the country will at least be given the opportunity to compete once again. † And with that, here are some highlights and notes from 2020: With the status of COVID-19 everchanging, the current outlook is one that seeks to have in-person schooling upon the start of fall. Despite this, some schools have already announced remote instruction for their fall terms as well as even the entire year. At the moment, expect to see the Gauchos back on the field for 2021, but don't be too surprised if remote instruction and social distancing extends into next spring. Stay safe and we hope to see Caesar Uyesaka Stadium filled once more!

sports,UCSB Intramural Faces No Lag in Building Out Successful ESports Program,16-Jun-20,5:05 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-16/ucsb-intramural-faces-no-lag-in-building-out-successful-esports-program/," What do intramural sports look like in the wake of a devastating virus that feeds off of close bodily contact? When UC Santa Barbara transitioned to remote learning in the spring, Department of Recreation Intramural Coordinator Gabe Escobedo and his team faced the unenviable task of answering this question ""î of finding a way to keep students involved without in-person intramural athletics. ""úCanceling IMs all together never crossed our minds,""ù Escobedo said. ""úWe wanted to provide our students with safe, healthy alternatives to in-person sports.""ù Enter Intramural ESports ""î a brand-new approach to traditional intramural sports that Escobedo and his team pioneered this spring. Born out of necessity, the Intramural team had only a few weeks to plan, organize and execute the concept. Given the time constraints, Intramural ESports only featured three different games: Rocket League, FIFA 20 and NBA 2K20. With Rocket League, each participant had the option to play in a 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3 league. In each sport, players were grouped into different divisions based on their skill level. Mikal de Wit ""î a Spring 2020 graduate and Recreation Center employee who helped Escobedo plan Intramural ESports ""î participated in all three variations of Rocket League and noted the enthusiasm from other participants. ""úI was surprised at how many people had signed up; we had close to 100 people in just Rocket League,""ù de Wit said. ""úAs a [Rocket League] player, I thought it was really cool to add something to the game and have something to play towards.""ù In each division, de Wit played two series for a three-week period, with each series consisting of a best-two-out-of-three format. Between setting up the game with his opponent and breaks within the game, de Wit estimated that each Rocket League series took about half an hour. After the regular season, players who qualified for the playoffs faced off in a best-of-five series, with a final best-of-seven series to determine the champion. ""úIn my experience, the games were competitive but very friendly,""ù de Wit said. ""ú The format was cool because you got to play against [playoff] opponents during the regular season, so in the finals, you already played them and you're hoping to get the win this time around in the postseason.""ù While it started as an emergency backup plan, the inaugural Intramural ESports featured hundreds of participants and allowed the Intramural program to engage with students who wouldn't normally participate in intramural sports, according to Escobedo. ""úA large part of the Department of Recreation's mission and values is being student-focused,""ù Escobedo said. ""úAs long as our students continue to show that they're substantially interested in ESports, Intramural will enjoy growing our ESports offerings.""ù Indeed, Escobedo and the team are committed to expanding and improving upon their current ESports program. This summer, they are working with Francisco Rodriguez ""î the ESports and Outreach Officer for Gaucho Gaming ""î to create a much broader program for the fall. ""úUCSB is one of the few UCs that's lacked any school-backing Esports program,""ù Rodriguez said. ""ú Since I transferred [in 2018], I've been working on creating a program, and now that they see that ESports is extremely viable, we are having a series of meetings to create an ESports Program at UCSB.""ù While the logistics of that program are yet to be determined, it seems clear that Intramural ESports will return in the fall with more game offerings for students to choose from. Despite a pre-COVID reluctance, the Intramural team seems to have embraced ESports""î and, in some ways, embraced the future of sports and gaming.

sports,"After Years of Disaster, Rejuvenated Manchester United Shows Signs of Life",28-Jun-20,7:14 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-06-28/after-years-of-disaster-rejuvenated-manchester-united-shows-signs-of-life/," It's weird to feel hope as a Manchester United fan. It's a feeling I haven't felt in years ""î something I haven't experienced since Robin van Persie was still banging in goals in 2013.† Sure, there have been occasional highlights: the second-place finish under Jos√© Mourinho in 2018, and the three-goal comeback against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League last year. Those were certainly nice moments. But they never felt indicative of broader success; rather, they felt lucky. United fans were happy we finished second because, frankly, we didn't deserve to (thank you, David de Gea). United fans were happy we came back against PSG because we knew we lacked the quality to compete with a team of that caliber ""î something United proved when they flamed out in the next round against Barcelona. But on Wednesday, when Manchester United dismantled Sheffield United 3-0, I felt hope. I say dismantled because, well, the 3-0 scoreline doesn't do justice to the performance. After two early goals, Manchester United was content to maintain possession, forcing the Blades to chase the ball around for most of the second half. The Red Devils kept 68% possession on Wednesday, while outshooting Sheffield United 13-4. To be transparent, it was a lackluster performance from Sheffield United, who have looked less-than-stellar since the restart. While the Blades still sit in an impressive eighth place, they've looked much more like the newly promoted side they are in recent times, rather than the team that was pushing to qualify for the Champions League back in March. But Wednesday's performance was bigger than gaudy stats, bigger than an underwhelming opponent. No, Wednesday's performance was a blueprint to future success for Manchester United. Since Manchester United acquired creative maestor Bruno Fernandes in January, pundits and fans alike have wondered how Fernandes could coexist with star French international Paul Pogba, who had spent most of the season on the sidelines with an ankle injury. In February and March ""î without Pogba ""î Fernandes displayed his quality, racking up 4 goals and 3 assists as an attacking midfielder. Fernandes' ability to play a killer pass, as well as his lethal long-range shot, allowed Manchester United to better break down opponents playing a low defensive block. With a healthy Pogba, however, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had to devise a plan in which the two could play together. While both offer creativity and quality going forward, both also oftentimes struggle on the defensive end. Many pundits speculated that playing both together would cause problems for United's back four. While it remains to be seen how the two perform together against a top opponent, Wednesday's performance should help disprove that theory. Solskjaer employed Pogba as a deep-lying playmaker, which enabled him to control the pace of the game while still providing cover for the back line. Although not quite as dangerous going forward as he usually is, Pogba still had the ability to play dangerous through balls ""î which he successfully did throughout the game. Meanwhile, Fernandes operated in his favored attacking midfielder role, linking up with Pogba and the front three on multiple occasions. Most importantly, Solskjaer utilized veteran midfielder Nemanja Matic as a holding midfielder who acted as the glue that kept the entire formation functional. There's no doubt that the 31-year-old has lost a step in recent years; with Pogba and Fernandes ahead of him on the pitch, however, they don't need his pace. Instead, Matic operated just in front of the full-backs, sniffing out any counterattacking chances that Sheffield United had when Pogba opted to move up the pitch into the attacking third. To be clear, Manchester United wasn't flawless on Wednesday. Marcus Rashford ""î Manchester United's top goal scorer this season ""î missed a few easy chances, although his passing was pristine. The Red Devils still desperately need a right winger: Mason Greenwood is great, but he's a far better second-striker than winger. The backline of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof ""î as solid as it's been this season ""î still struggled against pacy counterattacks. And striker Anthony Martial won't be able to score a hat trick every game. If Manchester United wants to challenge for the title next season instead of fighting for a Champions League berth, it will need to improve on all of these fronts while renewing the contract of Pogba. †For the first time in recent memory, however, there's a clear path ahead for Manchester United. It may not be much, but after everything that has gone wrong in the past seven years for the Red Devils, it's a welcome start.

sports,From Europe to England: How Liverpool Finally Ended Their 30-Year Title Drought,22-Jul-20,3:56 PM,['Nicholas DiPierro'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-07-22/from-europe-to-england-how-liverpool-finally-ended-their-30-year-title-drought/," Today, Liverpool hosted Chelsea""î lifting the Premier League trophy for the first time since their confirmation as champions. Interestingly, the rise of COVID-19 and the pause of sports worldwide means Liverpool, who had already won the league in record games, has also taken the most time to win said trophy. A typical Premier League season will run roughly from mid-August to early-May, but Liverpool were crowned champions just prior to the start of July after Chelsea's upset of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on June 25. In that game, City got the first look at goal after Riyad Mahrez, on his off-wing, once again showed his class with a tight curler to the head of Fernandinho, who had joined the attack and found himself in the box just ahead of Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Arrizabalaga stood strong and Chelsea would quickly wake up. Miscommunication between Benjamin Mendy and ƒ∞lkay G√ºndoƒüan in an attempt to recover possession gave American Christian Pulisic an attempt at goal and it was 1-0 Chelsea late in the first half. A great run by Mahrez and a slick through ball from (best in the world?) midfielder Kevin De Bruyne left Chelsea anchor N'Golo Kant√© chasing, and ultimately, fouling Mahrez just outside the box. De Bruyne took the free kick per usual and what a free kick he took. A piece of utter brilliance, the game was then tied 1-1 with over a half hour to go. City would need to win this game if they were to stop J√ºrgen Klopp's Liverpool. City would then tic-tac-toe down the pitch only for the sensational Raheem Sterling to hit the woodwork on an empty net in the 56th minute. Mason Mount, Chelsea's inspiring 21-year old, later found himself on the receiving end of an Ederson miskick. Ederson reacted quickly and forced the Englishman's go-ahead shot wide. The 70th minute saw Pulisic show-off some fancy footwork just before Kyle Walker's work rate earned his team a goal-line clear to keep the game locked up. It wasn't until another scramble in front of Ederson that the Blues would finally crack the code. Tammy Abraham would voice his displeasure to referee Stuart Attwell, and Fernandinho was later found guilty of a penalty after video review. And in the 77th minute of the do-or-die match, veteran winger Willian Borges da Silva would fool Ederson to his left with a cheeky delay just before sealing the deal with a rocket inside the opposite post. And thus, Liverpool's 30-year league title drought was over. Despite Liverpool's two Champions League trophies during this time, in 2005 and 2019, the formation of the Premier League in 1992 would prove to coincide with the dominance of fierce rivals Manchester United. Known as the Red Devils, United would go on to win two Champions League trophies themselves, but all the while adding thirteen English Premier League titles to their shelf, essentially eclipsing Liverpool as the most decorated English club of all-time. So while the English Premier League records read 13-1 in titles, the truth is that Liverpool now find themselves just a single title away from tying United's all-time record of 20. And as if the 30-year drought wasn't enough, Liverpool fans must wait for one more if they are to get an edge in the bragging rights. Before that, however, is the list of records now owned by Liverpool after this incredible season: For details of all the aforementioned records including records still up for grabs and those missed out on, check out Dale Johnson's ""úRecord-breaking Liverpool set new standards with Premier League title win""ù on ESPN.com.† So, then, where are we? With two games left to play, Liverpool are looking like a side that's ready for a break. After drawing nil with Everton in their first game since the pandemic pause, Klopp's Reds found the inspiration for a 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace but have boasted a measly 2-1-2 record since, including a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Pep's Citizens just a match after winning the league. More than that, the drop in form has come after a blistering 28-2-1 run to start the season. If that's not tiring, I don't know what is. Fortunately for Liverpool fans, however, they'll have nothing on their minds save for that sweet sound of ""¶ champions. Congratulations.

sports,Marella To Swim Ten Miles for COVID Relief,13-Aug-20,8:32 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-13/marella-to-swim-ten-miles-for-covid-relief/," Dan Marella was never serious about swimming 10 miles ""î at least, not at first.† Sure, Marella had picked up open water swimming during quarantine, but that was largely out of necessity. With the closure of swimming pools due to COVID regulations, Marella, a rising UC Santa Barbara junior and men's swimming team captain, had begun training with a group of older swimmers, including his assistant coach, Mark Stori. After the group had finished a six-mile open water swim to celebrate a group members' birthday, Stori jokingly told Marella that he should do a 10-mile swim. ""úAt first, I didn't take it seriously,""ù Marella said. A few days later, however, Marella decided to turn that off-the-cuff statement into reality. ""úThe whole thing came together naturally,""ù he said. ""úI decided that if I was going [to swim 10 miles], I wanted to do it for a cause.""ù Marella began to brainstorm causes he was passionate about, causes in which he could help make a difference. While Marella considered raising money for Black Lives Matter, UCSB Swimming had just recently held a fundraiser for the movement. Instead, Marela opted to raise money for COVID relief. ""úI was motivated by the fact that America has done such a poor job containing this virus,""ù he said. ""úThere's been a real lack of awareness from people on the news who aren't wearing masks, and even people in I.V.""ù COVID relief falls under a broad spectrum however, and Marella wanted to make as tangible a difference as possible. Rather than donate to a countrywide organization, Marella has opted to raise funds for Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara County. ""úIt's really hard to gain attention for a worldwide issue,""ù Marella said. ""úThere are thousands of people in Santa Barbara County, and I want to hopefully create a trend where others can have an impact on their local community.""ù These donations will go to Cottage Hospital in two separate funds. The first (and larger) fund covers COVID home kits ""î given to people that test positive but don't necessarily have to go to the hospital. These kits include items such as pulse oximeters and thermometers and help to ensure that hospitals don't get overcrowded. Marella talked directly with Dr. Lynn Fitzgibbons, an infectious disease specialist at Cottage Hospital and Gaucho alumna who spent her collegiate career playing for the water polo team, and decided that these kits would help alleviate stress for healthcare workers. The second fund will help Cottage workers with daily tasks, such as childcare. Since the idea took fruition, Marella has been training every single day, swimming around four miles daily. Marella typically starts his swim at 66 DP and goes all the way to the Goleta Pier and back. For Marella ""î a lifelong pool swimmer ""î perhaps the biggest transition has been dealing with the current. While he swims with the current on the way to the pier, he must navigate swimming against the current on the return. ""úEvery so often, I have to look up and make sure I'm still going in a straight line and not drifting,""ù he said. In addition, Marella must combat the mental fatigue associated with such a long swim. In the pool, Marella's main event is 400 meters; on Saturday, he will swim 16,093 meters ""î over 40 times longer. ""úIt's really easy to get lost in your head,""ù Marella said. ""úYou constantly analyze how you're doing in terms of technique, and how you're feeling.""ù But outside of those adjustments, the transition to open water swimming has been relatively effortless for Marella. With every swim, Marella feels himself getting less and less tired. While a slight hint of doubt remains in the back of Marella's mind, he feels confident for Saturday. ""úThere's always that what-if, but after swimming more and more, I know that I can do this,""ù Marella said. Individuals who want to contribute to Marella's effort can do so in two primary ways. The first is by going to https://www.cottagehealth.org/donate/, and putting ""úDaniel's Fight Against COVID Swim""ù in the tribute box. In addition, donors are eligible to join Marella on his swim, as long as they donate at least $100 for each mile they swim with him.

sports,Cannon Hosts Official UCSB Baseball Podcast,29-Aug-20,5:58 PM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-08-29/cannon-hosts-official-ucsb-baseball-podcast/," It's not every day that the person sweeping the dirt after baseball games one day is the same person interviewing an MLB all-star the next ""î unless you're Kevin Cannon, the director of facilities and now official podcast host for UC Santa Barbara baseball. Following the abrupt ending to, well, life as we knew it, Cannon decided to merge his day job with his passion for sports broadcasting. †In the midst of what was initially a baseball-less summer, Cannon started up a quarantine project, a podcast titled ""úGaucho 9.""ù In it, he utilizes his behind-the-scenes experience with the players, coaches, and staff to illuminate the laudable line of talent and work ethic which has defined UCSB's baseball program. †Cannon transferred as a student to UCSB in the 2011-12 school year, the same year Head Coach Andrew Checketts joined the blooming program. Each individual continues to brighten the legacy of UCSB baseball. †Cannon's now almost decade-long relationship with the UCSB baseball program ""î the players, coaches, staff and alumni base ""î began, ironically, with his rejection from the team itself. Forced to reconcile with the cut, Cannon eagerly inserted himself into the program by becoming a student manager for the team. Cannon executed a myriad of tasks until he graduated: everything from field maintenance and press box management, to throwing batting practice for players. †He stayed involved after graduation, pursuing his interest in sports broadcasting for the baseball program while also continuing to fulfill the field and team duties. After travelling to the College World Series in Omaha with the 2016 squad, Cannon officially joined the program as a paid employee. Currently, he serves as the director of facilities in which he manages field and stadium maintenance and improvements and also acts as an administrator of student managers and work-study crews. And, yes, he was the one responsible for adding lights to the stadium this past season.† †Beyond the logistical day-to-day tasks, Cannon is often interacting, travelling and collaborating with the team. Consequently, he has been able to develop unique relationships with the players, one which balances a high level of respect and appreciation with light-hearted, friendly banter. †""úI like to keep it light with them. I want them to be my friend, but at the same time I kind of want them to respect the work I do. I'm out here busting my tail, and they recognize that ""¶ I'm doing a lot of stuff for them, and I try and remind them on a daily basis that they're in a good position,""ù Cannon said. †By now, Cannon has watched nine seasons' worth of players come in and out of the UCSB baseball program, and he understands Santa Barbara's second-tier status ""î despite its Division I ranking ""î when it comes to athletic recognition. Across all sports, Cannon holds a genuine appreciation for the overlooked talent and work ethic of Gaucho athletes. †With UCSB baseball, it is no different. He prides the program on its continuous emphasis of work, grit and player development. He lauds the deep tradition of growth and talent that the UCSB baseball program has harbored without the attraction of an irresistible stadium or brand-new uniforms. Simply put, Cannon is critical to a smooth season of Gaucho baseball ""î and the perfect person to head up a podcast about UCSB's baseball program.† †This appreciation for baseball, for Gaucho baseball, is reflected in conversation, in Cannon's work and most pointedly in his podcast. ""úGaucho 9""ù captures an unexpected load of professional success, lessons learned and mentorships based and formed within the UCSB baseball community. Interviews with Gaucho alum-turned-MLB stars and coaches like Michael Young and Skip Schumaker give a glimpse into the depth of the university's overlooked athletic program. Check-ins with current players provide just a bit of sound reassurance of normalcy among the daily chaos of the pandemic. †There is a casual fluidity in Cannon's conversations with these guys ""î he knows his shit, and it shows. When asked about it, he attributes the quality to that universal language that baseball enthusiasts, players or not, seem to all share. It's that undeniably impressive ability to reference on command what might seem to an outsider like irrelevant statistics, dates or even a random play in that one inning during that one game. †Passion for baseball in a time without baseball undoubtedly underlines each of the 18 episodes. †However, the podcast just as much retains an accessible quality, one strong enough to engage listeners outside of this immediate bubble of fanatics. In its most basic form, the podcast is an ongoing human-interest story. It explores the process of athletes recognizing their potentials, making impactful decisions, being surrounded by influential people and reflecting on their characters as players. †Cannon says he thinks of the podcast as a platform for players to dig into their athletic and personal journeys.†† †""úYou can go on and be yourself,""ù he starts. ""úI want to find out things about you that define who you are, like where you came from. What were your motivations? Where did your inspiration come from? Why do you work so hard? ""¶ What were the characteristics you had as a kid and trying to recognize that 20 years down the road? ""¶ There's a reason you're here.""ù †Cannon initially called the podcast a ""úquarantine project,""ù explaining that it was meant to distract listeners from the increasingly disheartening news that began unfolding in the early days of spring. The Gauchos' 2020 season ""î one in which he and others claimed had College World Series potential ""î had just been abruptly yanked from the players amidst the surfacing pandemic. The roster had played the third game of what ended up being its last series on March 8, only days before the university announced it would move the final days of Winter Quarter 2020 instruction and exams online. †""úWe have unfinished business,""ù Cannon reflects. From his perspective, the team had broken into a formidable stride since the onset of the season. Their stream of wins was a collaborative effort in the truest form and had different players stepping up in critical ways each game. Cannon admits that after seeing the momentous success of the young team, the cancellation felt ""úkind of like a slap in the face.""ù However, he recognizes that, in the best-case scenario where athletes are allowed to resume playing, the same success might be replicated in the upcoming 2021 season.†† †Yet still, five months later, this thought remains merely hopeful speculation. In the meantime, Cannon employs the ""úGaucho 9""ù podcast to re-engage Gaucho fans, players and alumni and, at the very least, continue to keep Santa Barbara baseball on people's radar. †When I asked Cannon to recommend an episode or two for a new listener, he humbly struggled to narrow it down. †For a Gaucho baseball all-history lesson: Episode 5 with Al Ferrer. For some A-game interviewing with an MLB all-star: Episode 6 with Michael Young and Bob Brontsema. And for a dive into the world of sports broadcasting: Episode 12 with Travis Rogers. †To listen to any of the 18 (and counting) episodes on ""úGaucho 9,""ù check out the UCSB baseball website or the podcast's official Instagram page (@ucsbgaucho9podcast).

sports,"With World Cup Qualifying on the Horizon, How Does the USMNT Stack Up?",22-Sep-20,5:30 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-09-22/with-world-cup-qualifying-on-the-horizon-how-does-the-usmnt-stack-up/," I still remember that fateful October day ""î the day the US men's national team was eliminated from world cup qualifying. Like most fans, I went into the game expecting an easy victory. Sure, their form had been iffy throughout qualifiers, but Trinidad and Tobago entered the game in woeful form too. Even if this wasn't the strongest rendition of the US men's national team (USMNT), surely it had to be enough to defeat a team that had one victory in their last nine games? †Slowly, that belief dissipated. As I lay on the floor of my Anacapa dorm room, watching the game on possibly the blurriest stream I have ever used, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. In every aspect of the game, the USMNT was thoroughly outclassed by Trinidad and Tobago. In possibly the most embarrassing game in the history of American soccer, the USMNT failed to qualify for the world cup for the first time since 1986. Since that lowly 2017 day, the USMNT has largely gone under the radar. Quietly, however, 2022 world cup qualifying is creeping around the corner, with the first games set to begin in early 2021. Three years after disaster, does the USMNT have the squad necessary to avoid a repeat performance? On paper, the answer to that question should be a resounding yes. Just as they were in 2017, the Americans are led by the uber-talented Christian Pulisic. Since making the switch to Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund, Pulisic has taken his game to the next level, tallying nine goals in the premier league last season. Even as an 18 year old in 2017, Pulisic was undoubtedly the USMNT's best player. Three years later, his pace, finishing and final ball will be crucial to the success of the team. Perhaps the biggest difference between this rendition of the USMNT and the previous rendition is the improvement of the midfield. Last cycle, the team still leaned heavily on Michael Bradley. While Bradley can help break a defense down, his lack of pace severely limited the Americans when they took on more athletic midfields. Now, the USMNT will lean on Weston McKennie in the midfield, who surely will be one of the first names on the team sheet in qualifying. After an impressive stint at Schalke, McKennie made the move to Juventus this year, where he will likely be a rotation option for the Italian side. While McKennie may not be the most technical midfielder, he makes up with those shortcomings through his work rate and defensive acumen. Alongside McKennie, Leipzig midfielder Tyler Adams is likely to feature for the U.S. as a holding midfielder. Fresh off a goal in the Champions League quarterfinals, Adams plays a similar role to McKennie ""î albeit in a more holding position. These two in the midfield will provide the composure, athleticism and defensive prowess that the USMNT sorely missed in 2017. While young, both players have now played multiple years for top clubs in Europe and will play key roles in the qualifying campaign. Importantly, the US has also made significant improvements at the back this time. Once again, John Brooks ""î a steady defender who has been a stalwart for German side Wolfsburg† ""î will lead the backline. Last cycle, the USMNT struggled at both wide defending positions, although particularly at left back. Since then, Reggie Cannon has made leaps and bounds as a player, highlighted by his recent move from FC Dallas to Portuguese side Boavista. On the right, Head Coach Gregg Berhalter will likely lean on a combination of Deandre Yedlin and Sergino Dest. While Yedlin struggled mightily in the premier league, his pace and experience should help shore up the USMNT's back line. Meanwhile, Dest is one of the most exciting prospects for the USMNT, who shockingly chose to play for the United States instead of the Netherlands. The 19-year-old Ajax defender has been linked to a move with either Bayern Munich or Barcelona, and there is no doubt he will feature heavily for the USMNT in this cycle. If there's a weakness in the team, it potentially lies in the team's ability to manufacture goals ""î especially against Concacaf opponents that will play a low block and look to break on the counter. Because neither McKennie or Adams are especially prolific going forward, the USMNT will need their wingers and strikers to provide a bulk of the goal-scoring. Of course, Pulisic will contribute significantly to that tally, but he will need help as defenses zero in on him. On the right wing, 17-year-old Gio Reyna has flashed immense potential at Borussia Dortmund, though he will need to prove his consistency to become a surefire starter. If not, the Americans can lean on Jordan Morris, who has transitioned to becoming a winger after a torn ACL sapped him of some of his athleticism. If neither of those two pan out, Besiktas winger Tyler Boyd can also put in a solid shift out wide. Perhaps the biggest question mark for the team lies at the forward position. Josh Sargent is arguably the best forward prospect the USMNT has, but the 20-year-old still has to prove his consistency in the bundesliga. Similarly, 20-year-old Timothy Weah is a tantalizing prospect, but has yet to receive a start after signing for Lille this summer. While the U.S. can use stalwarts Jozy Altidore and Gyasi Zardes in the interim, these two lack the quality the USMNT needs to break down Concacaf defenses.
 On paper, this American squad features more than enough talent to qualify for the 2022 world cup ""î and potentially even make a splash in the tournament. But the 2017 squad also featured enough talent to qualify. To turn that potential into results, this squad will need an attacker outside of Pulisic to step up and will need consistent performances from the youthful members of the squad. Comments are closed.

Ranked among the top 10 squads in the nation, the Burning Skirts are further evidence of UCSB's often-overlooked athletic success. In its past few seasons, the UCSB women's ultimate frisbee team has performed impressively amongst local and national competitors. Before COVID-19 halted their 2020 spring post-season, the girls were ranked No. 7 in the nation; at one point before that, they were ranked as high as No. 4. †Described as a mixture of football, soccer and basketball, ultimate frisbee captures the fast-paced fluidity and camaraderie that former athletes crave, while offering an opportunity for community and player development for new-to-sports prospects. †The self-officiated game fosters a culture of respect, positivity and fierce competitiveness not only within Santa Barbara's squad, but among the entire ultimate frisbee community. It is this quality, captured by what senior co-captain Nicki Yang calls ""úthe spirit of the game,""ù which attracts fun-loving players who collectively develop a passion for ultimate frisbee and a strong commitment to their teammates. †The 30-girl roster welcomes everyone: from incoming freshmen to graduate students, and from former competitive athletes to never-played-a-sport-before rookies. And for the Burning Skirts, every one of these players is an investment. †This season's three senior captains ""î Felicia Cruz, Leah Forester and Nicki Yang ""î are eager to not only recruit girls who, in the short term, will fill the spots of the 14 Spring 2021 graduates, but to more importantly give those girls the genuine friendship and competitive fix that will make the decision to stay on the team a no-brainer, just as it did for them. †The three collectively emphasize their team's camaraderie, noting that even when the first few practices don't sell the new players, the positive energy of the returning girls does. Their testament about how close they are speaks for itself: They train together, they eat together, they travel together ""î oh, and they live together. †In a typical fall pre-season, the team focuses on training and development, orienting the new players to the fast-paced game and integrating them into the tight-knit roster. Two fall tournaments allow the new squad to develop, tweak and perfect their skills in preparation for its three main tournaments in the winter season. †However, it is the team's consistent performance in post-season that speaks especially to their ability to develop and hone their old and new talent. During spring quarter, the frisbee squad typically embarks on its journey to Nationals, for which it has qualified and competed in the past two years. In a combination of home and away tournaments, the team competes against local rivals Cal Poly, UCLA and UCSD, as well as farther competitors like Northeastern and University of Wisconsin. †Unfortunately, COVID-19 has so far halted in-person practices and team meet-ups, and their season, like many others, remains in limbo. Both UCSB and USA Ultimate, the governing body for Ultimate frisbee, have yet to release explicit statements regarding potential options for the upcoming season. †The captains have nonetheless done their best to keep players involved and in shape, sending out workouts and hosting virtual team trainings. They recognize that many freshman and new transfer students are eager to explore different UCSB organizations and to safely meet people on campus, and are therefore committed to virtually integrating new players as best as possible. †The Burning Skirts will be holding a virtual information session this Tuesday, Oct. 6 from 8 to 9 p.m., and they encourage anyone with even a speck of interest to attend and hear more about their team. The link to sign up can be found on any of their social media platforms: Instagram @burningskirtucsb, Twitter: @Bskirts, and Facebook: Burning Skirts ""ì UCSB Women's Ultimate Frisbee. † † Comments are closed.

sports,"Despite NBA's Player Isolation Bubble Success, Model Remains Inaccessible for UCSB Sports",21-Oct-20,8:48 PM,['Krishan Yadav'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-21/despite-nbas-player-isolation-bubble-success-model-remains-inaccessible-for-ucsb-sports/," As the 2019-20 NBA season comes to an end with the Lakers winning their 17th title, one can come to appreciate how this season was able to continue amid the COVID-19 crisis. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, set up an ambitious plan: Continue the rest of the NBA season in an isolated ""úbubble.""ù In this bubble, there were strict regulations on who could come in or out, as well as an extensive list of guidelines to follow to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The result of this bubble was a huge success, with zero reported cases of COVID-19 in the bubble. Initially, from observing what the NBA did and their successes, I looked to find ways for college sports to adapt principles from the bubble in order to start up their programs on a larger scale once again. But through my research, I realized the underlying factors in place that made the NBA bubble possible do not translate into other areas due to these three main factors: Money The NBA bubble cost an exorbitant amount of money. The NBA had to pay for players living at three Disney resorts, chefs, entertainment and COVID-19 testing, among other expenses. Joe Vardon, a senior writer at the Athletic who participated in the bubble, estimated that the total cost of the operation was $170 million. On top of that, the NBA lost around 40 of its revenue due to fans not being present in the arena and spending on purchases during games. Comparing this to UCSB's expenses, the university's basketball program tends to make and spend about $14.8 million, according to College Factual. With an expected cut to the revenue side, increasing the cost in such a drastic way would not be feasible for a school such as UCSB. Mental Health Another aspect of the bubble that would not translate well into the college scene is the ability to maintain the mental health of athletes. Within the bubble, many NBA players reported having struggles with their mental health. LeBron James mentioned, ""úI've had numerous nights and days where I've been thinking about leaving the bubble. I think everyone has. I don't think there's one person that has not had a mind that said ""òoh, I've got to get the hell out of here.'""ù Other players such as Paul George mentioned, ""úI underestimated mental health. I had anxiety. A little bit of depression. Us being locked in here, I just wasn't there. I just checked out.""ù† A variety of reasons could have led to these struggles such as the isolation that players are in, allowing them to become trapped in their thoughts more easily, or the fact that these players were separated from their families for months, only being able to see a couple of family members two months into the bubble. The NBA also had the luxury of having a team therapist in order to help and manage their struggles on a daily basis. While there are ways to manage mental health, colleges would lack the resources to be able to provide this to student athletes. Location The NBA is a massive multibillion-dollar organization that has connections to many different agencies. Because of its connections with Disney, the NBA was able to rent out the Walt Disney World Resort, which possessed the perfect infrastructure for a situation like this. Unfortunately, these are not available around the country, making it nearly impossible to create an atmosphere where players can play their sports and have a living situation that would allow for the same success that the NBA bubble had. The NBA bubble is one of those once-in-a-generation type of events. It made the 2019-20 NBA season unique and provided an atmosphere that allowed fans to experience one of the most equal-footed NBA seasons in many years. While college sports may not be able to have their own ""úbubble,""ù there are still things they can take away from it and apply to their own leagues. Comments are closed.

After months of uncertainty following the cancellation of all fall sports, the schedule release signals the intent of the Big West Conference to have a basketball season this school year.

Rather than the usual round-robin gauntlet, each team will play back-to-back games against the same opponent, with the majority of these games taking place on Fridays and Saturdays. Through this method, the conference hopes to limit travel while still allowing each team to play every conference opponent twice. †In addition, each team will have a one week bye in the schedule. However, games will not be rescheduled if a team is forced to quarantine. Both UC Santa Barbara basketball teams will kick off conference play on Sunday, Dec. 27 against UC Irvine, with the women's team hosting the Anteaters at the Thunderdome and the men traveling down to Irvine. As of now, no fans will be allowed in the stands for these games; however, this issue will be revisited by the Big West Board of Directors as the season progresses. For the rest of the season, the men's and women's teams will play nearly identical schedules. While both teams will play against the same school on the same day, one team will host the game at the Thunderdome while the other team will travel for a road game. Both teams will play a 20-game schedule, with the final games of the season on March 5 and 6 against Cal Poly. For those games, the men's team will play at the Thunderdome while the women's team will travel to San Luis Obispo.

sports,Lucky Number 13: Chronicling Rafael Nadal's 13 French Open Titles in the Past 15 Years,26-Oct-20,12:48 PM,['Jai Uparkar'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-10-26/headline-lucky-number-13-chronicling-rafael-nadals-13-french-open-titles-in-the-past-15-years/," Rafael Nadal's, more commonly known as the ""úKing of Clay,""ù dominant French Open (Roland Garros) win earlier this month proved to be historic in multiple ways. He won his 13th French Open without dropping a single set, which is the most Grand Slam titles any individual has ever won at the same venue. In the same tournament, Nadal tied Roger Federer's record of 20 Grand Slams, the most among men. This victory also gave Nadal his 100th match win at the French Open, a tournament in which he has only lost two matches. The Spaniard is also the oldest French Open champion since Andr√©s Gimeno in 1972. The enormity of this achievement warrants a reflection of Nadal's dominance of the most difficult major to win. 2005† Nadal clinched his maiden Grand Slam during his French Open at the mere age of 19. He came into the tournament with a 17-match streak on clay, making him one of the favorites to win the title. Leading up to the final match, Nadal defeated No. 1, Roger Federer. A final win against Argentina's Argentina's Mariano Puerta propelled Nadal into the No. 3 spot in the world.† 2006 Nadal defended his first French Open title by besting Federer 1""ì6, 6""ì1, 6""ì4, 7""ì6(7""ì4).† Coming into the tournament, Nadal had won all four European tournaments he had entered, which he played, beating Federer for two of those titles. This win was Nadal's second Grand Slam title, his 6th consecutive victory on clay, and his 14th match win streak at Roland Garros.† 2007† Nadal successfully defended his past two French Open titles by again defeating Federer in the final 6""ì3, 4""ì6, 6""ì3, 6""ì4. Coming into the tournament, he won three out of the four European clay tournaments:† Masters Series Monte Carlo, the Open Sabadell Atl√°ntico in Barcelona, and the Masters Series Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. This win marked his third Grand Slam title and his 21 match win streak at the tournament.† 2008† Once again, Nadal defended his three consecutive French Open titles by defeating Federer in straight sets. This was the fourth straight year that Nadal had defeated Federer at the French Open and also marked the fourth consecutive year Nadal won the tournament. Nadal had also won the tournament without losing a single set. This win extended his match-winning streak to 28. He later won Wimbledon and an† Olympic Gold medal at the 2008Beijing Olympics.† 2010 Nadal experienced his first loss at the French open during 2009 after losing in a 4th round upset against Robin Soderling, the eventual runner-up. This loss snapped his 31 winning-match streak at the tournament. However, he ended up winning his fifth French Open title by defeating Soderling, the very player who defeated him the year earlier, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4. Just like in 2008, Nadal was able to win the tournament without dropping a single set. By winning the title, Nadal regained the world No. 1 title from Federer. Nadal later went on to win Wimbledon and the US Open.† 2011 Nadal defended his 2010 title by defeating Federer, 7""ì5, 7""ì6(7""ì3), 5""ì7, 6""ì1. This was the sixth time Nadal had won the tournament which made him tie Bj√∂rn Borg's record for the most French Opens won by men in the Open Era.† 2012 Nadal won his third consecutive French Open title by defeating Novak Djokovic 6""ì4, 6""ì3, 2""ì6, 7""ì5. This was his seventh French Open win, which exceeded Borg's record for the most French Open titles won by men and tied Pete Sampras' Wimbledon record for most title wins at a Grand Slam.† 2013† Nadal was able to successfully defend his three consecutive titles by defeating David Ferrer in a 6""ì3, 6""ì2, 6""ì3 set. This was his fourth straight French Open title and his eighth title overall. This victory marked his 59th win at the tournament, which surpassed the previous record held by Federer and Guillermo Vilas.† 2014 Nadal defended his four consecutive French Open titles by defeating Djokovic 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-4. This win marked his ninth French Open crown and this fourteenth Grand Slam title. Not only was he the first man to win the same Grand Slam nine times, but he also was the first man to win the tournament five times in a row. During his 2014 tennis season, Nadal suffered from multiple injuries that prevented him from defending his title at the Barcelona Open and the Monte Carlos Masters (European clay tournaments); nonetheless,, he bounced back to win the French Open.† 2017 After losing to Novak Djovik in the 2015 French Open quarterfinals and withdrawing from his third-round match in 2016, Nadal captured his 10th French Open title and 15th Grand Slam title by beating Stan Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1. He also won the tournament without dropping a single set. With this win, Nadal became the first male player to win 10 singles titles at the same Grand Slam. He went on to win the US Open and ended the year as the top player in men's tennis.†† 2018 Nadal defended his 2017 French Open title by defeating Domonic Thiem 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, and thus won his 11th French Open crown by only dropping a single set the whole tournament. He tied Margaret Court's all-time record of 11 Grand Slam singles titles won at one major. Although he was plagued by a variety of injuries, he ended the year No. 2.† 2019† Nadal defended his two consecutive French Open titles by again defeating Domonic Thiem 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1. This was his 12th French Open title which broke the all-time record for the most singles titles won by a player at the same Grand Slam Tournament. He also won his ninth Italian Open title (European clay-court tournament). He later won the U.S. Open.† 2020 Just earlier this month Nadal defeated Novak Djokovic 6-0, 6-2, 7-5 to defend his three consecutive titles and win his 13th French Open title. This was the fourth time that Nadal had won the tournament without dropping a set. He broke his previous record of most singles Grand Slams won by a single player and tied Federer's record for the most Grand Slams singles title won by any player in the Open year. He became the first player to win 100 matches at the French Open.† Comments are closed.

sports,Tennis Coaches Speak on New Arnhold Tennis Center,10-Nov-20,10:40 AM,['Annika Pearson'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-10/tennis-coaches-speak-on-new-arnhold-tennis-center/," If the consistent Big West domination or the nationally ranked recruits didn't sell you on the legitimacy of the UC Santa Barbara tennis program, then perhaps the prospect of six new courts, two refurbished courts, seating for almost 300 fans and a 1,860 square-foot team building with men's and women's locker rooms, storage and a lounge will. †As of two weeks ago ""î†due to one of the largest donations ever made to UCSB athletics by John Arnhold '75 and his family ""î construction of the new $5.25-million Arnhold Tennis Center is underway. Though it won't be ready in time for the 2021 season, the project is set to be completed in eight months. The facility will replace the old Robertson Gym courts.† †Arnhold is a trustee with the UC Santa Barbara Foundation, a long-time tennis enthusiast and former chairmen of the board of governors for the International Tennis Hall of Fame.† †Over the past few years, Arnhold has spent a particularly large amount of time with UCSB women's tennis Head Coach Simon Thibodeau and his team, serving as a volunteer assistant coach as Thibodeau wanted to keep him (and his strategic advice) on the sidelines during matches.† According to UCSB men's tennis Head Coach Marty Davis and Thibodeau, when travelling with the teams, Arnhold was struck by the disparity between UCSB's and other top tennis schools' facilities despite being comparably competitive programs. Soon after, he committed to funding the new stadium ""î and by extension, to leveling the playing field for UCSB recruiting.† †Davis and Thibodeau consider the new tennis center to be a monumental step toward bringing well-deserved recognition to the program. †""úMen's and women's tennis are two of the more successful programs at UCSB and capable of competing like the baseball team [and] on a national level like the soccer team. [The new stadium] just has to elevate the visibility of the program, it just has to,""ù Davis said. †Davis said the future facility will be ""úa real, first-class, Division I tennis facility""ù ""î one that he hopes will attract both fans and top recruits. †""úIf you can bring a recruit on campus and watch a match at this facility with 300 fans there, that's going to make a favorable impression, I guarantee,""ù Davis asserted. †""ú[The stadium] has been something that's been missing to this program, to top everything there [that is already] at UCSB: the academics, the location, the scholarships now. It's just a very desirable place to study and be an athlete,""ù Thibodeau added. †Over the years, Arnhold has been a critical piece to UCSB tennis's puzzle in the recruiting arena, both coaches said. As tends to happen in Division I recruiting, UCSB was losing key prospects to other top tennis universities whose top-tier facilities and enticing scholarships were difficult to resist. Davis and Thibodeau said Arnhold helped fund tennis scholarships for the players.† Although it won't be on the new courts or in the fancy locker rooms, the men's and women's teams are set to begin their season in January 2021 ""î each with competitive but mostly local schedules due to COVID-19.

sports,UCSB Looks To Win First Conference Title Since 2011,12-Nov-20,10:21 AM,['Jai Uparkar'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-12/ucsb-looks-to-win-first-conference-title-since-2011/,"U With the 2019-20 season having ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Gauchos were unable to see what they could have achieved at the semifinals of the Big West Conference men's basketball championships. But the prospect of a new season brings with it new hopes and aspirations: a Big West title. Ever since the 2017-18 season, UC Santa Barbara has consistently performed as the second-best team in the Big West Conference, boasting an overall record of 21-10 last season. Their dominance over the past couple of years has set them up to win their first championship this season since 2011.† With rival UC Irvine as the clear threat to achieving this goal, the team will be looking to make up some major losses, with five players having graduated from last year's team., including Max Heidegger, who was the team's leading scorer. However, it is worth noting that the Gauchos went 11-2 in the 13 games that he missed, showing that the other players are capable of stepping up when needed.† Regardless of losing five members this year, the team is full of experienced players. The team will be commanded this year by senior guards JaQuori McLaughlin and Devearl Ramsey. One asset they will both bring to the team is their 3-point shooting and playmaking, as they averaged a combined 20 points and 7 assists per game last season.†† Delivering the scoring punch for the Gauchos, junior Amadou Sow will look to come in as a more polished scorer and fill the void left by Heidegger as the team's leading scorer. As Sow finished second last year in points per game and first in total points over the season at 437 points, this is a very achievable goal for the talented junior. As the forward, Sow will look to bolster the team's rebounding and shot-blocking, for which he was responsible for his team-high 7 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game. Other players on the team will be asked to step up and the potential is there. Forwards Robinson Idehen and Jay Nagle will be asked to complement Sow in the starting lineup.† Nagle is a versatile big with a great 3-point stroke, shooting 40% from deep for his career, while Idehen is big with a soft touch and good defensive IQ. Another player that will assume a larger role is junior S√©kou Tour√©. With Heidegger gone and Ramsey joining the starting lineup, Tour√© will be given the keys to the backup ball-handling duties ""î a job that he proved himself more than capable of doing last year.† The team excelled in assisting and rebounding last year. If the Gauchos continue on this trajectory while working on their 3-point shooting, then they may be able to clinch a title under the guidance of Coach Joe Pasternack.† The team will kick off their season on Dec. 27 against UC Irvine. This season will be a true test of character, what with COVID-19 protocols in place, but the Gauchos are highly capable of performing well regardless of the situation.† A version of this article appeared on page 7 of the November 12, 2020 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Gauchos Look To Build Off of Strong 2019-20 Campaign,13-Nov-20,10:46 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-13/gauchos-look-to-build-off-of-strong-2019-20-campaign/,"† Allison Fann/Daily Nexus It's been anything but a typical off-season for Coach† Bonnie Henrickson and the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team. The last time the Gauchos graced the court, then-junior point guard Danae Miller hit a buzzer-beater jump shot to knock off Hawai'i by 57-56. With the win, UCSB clinched the second seed in the Big West Conference tournament, as well as their fifth win in the last six games. That, of course, was in March. After months of cancellations and uncertainty, UCSB was finally able to resume in-person practice on Sept. 12 ""î about a month after the team normally starts gearing up for the season. Even then, the Gauchos were forced to practice outside on the tennis courts using portable baskets. After a tumultuous couple of months, the ""òChos have finally recaptured some semblance of normality. Recently, the team was given permission to move practice inside to the Thunderdome. While the pandemic still affects day-to-day operations, it is clear that there will be a women's basketball season. So where does that leave Henrickson and the Gauchos? The team faces a difficult task in replacing Coco Miller ""î a recent grad and versatile stud who provided playmaking on offense while frequently guarding their opponents' top scorer. While no single player can replace Coco Miller's production, Henrickson has a multitude of playmaking options at her disposal this season. After an injury-riddled 2020 season for the Gauchos, the team will get senior center Natalia Bruening and junior guard Bri Anugwom back for the start of the season. ""ú[Bruening] has a lot of history at the post position for us,""ù Henrickson told the Nexus. ""ú[Anugwom] worked on becoming a more capable 3-point shooter which will help space the defense. She's a good defender and a good rebounder for us.""ù In particular, the team will need to lean on Bruening ""î the team's only natural center. In 2019, Bruening averaged a solid 9.9 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. Without much depth at center, the team will likely play smaller than it has in past years. ,† Henrickson raised the possibility of† playing junior Lauren Lee at center in a small-ball lineup. While Lee only measures in at 5'11""ù, her elite defense and off-ball movement would allow the Gauchos to play fast and spread the defense. With the return of Danae Miller for her senior year, UCSB will have elite playmaking athletes who can take advantage of space in the defense. Last season, Danae Miller averaged a career-high 13.5 points per game, while also dishing out 4 assists per game. With University of Houston transfer Doris Jones eligible to play this season, UCSB will have a formidable backcourt duo. ""úWe want to challenge teams defensively with the different ways and players who can score,""ù Henrickson said. ""úIt's hard to guard 3-point shooters, penetrators and the rim at the same time.""ù Perhaps more so than usual, the Gauchos will have to rely on their depth this season. With back-to-back games every week in conference play, Henrickson will be unable to run her starters into the ground. In one of the feel-good stories of last year, senior forward Mira Shulman was given a scholarship for this off-season and will hope to provide some playmaking off the bench for the Gauchos. In addition, Henrickson will likely need to rely on Anya Choice and Alyssa Marin, two freshmen guards whom Henrickson praised heavily. Beyond that, however, there's still a lot up in the air for UCSB,at least in terms of numbers. Henrickson said the team is working on submitting waivers to gain eligibility for its two transfers: junior guard/forward Taylor Mole and junior guard Megan Anderson. Mole ""î a 6'2'' transfer from Colorado State ""î would provide the Gauchos with some needed height, while Anderson led San Jose State last season in 3-pointers made and would help space the floor further. If those waivers are denied ""î and they will likely either both be accepted or both be denied ""î then UCSB will only have 10 active players for the season. ""úWe're going to have to be creative based on our numbers,""ù Henrickson said. ""úI would say we could play more zone [to limit running], but we can't play zone because this conference shoots the ball so well. We'll have to be smart from Sunday to Friday ""î with more shooting, more film and more off-days.""ù While the nonconference schedule is yet to be finalized, it is likely that the Gauchos will open the season in late November. UCSB will play a handful of nonconference games in November and December, and will open conference play on Dec. 27 against UC Irvine. ""úThis is way different than any other season,""ù Henrickson said. ""úI really like this group, and I want to have a meaningful season for our seniors.""ù Comments are closed.

sports,Oil Clasico: Qatar and Saudi Arabia's Football Proxy War,16-Nov-20,10:46 AM,['Vir Pathak'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-16/oil-clasico-qatar-and-saudi-arabias-football-proxy-war/," The Middle East's influence on European football has become increasingly more apparent in recent years. One can simply look to the growing strength of teams like Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (FC) and Manchester City FC, whose owners are from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) ruling families respectively. Paris Saint-Germain won the French Ligue 1 for the third consecutive year in 2020 and reached this year's edition of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League Final, a competition home to the most elite of European football clubs. Manchester City won the English Premier League in 2019 and have established a hegemony in English football with themselves battling rivals Liverpool FC for dominance. For countries with such a relatively low soccer profile, what then accounts for the rapid rise in influence of Qatari and UAE players in the game's modern arena? Gaining Soft Power and Increasing Influence† One reason these countries enter the footballing sector is to increase their soft power in Europe. They pump much needed funds into teams they invest in, which generally results in these teams buying higher quality players and getting better results on the pitch. By being associated with a newly successful team, ruling Gulf families hope to rid themselves of their damaging track record, which includes domestic human rights abuses and an extinguishing of free speech. These Gulf families end up pouring absurd amounts of money into the game, giving them high levels of leverage over almost every facet of European football.† One of the most infamous examples of the UAE's power in the game is when Manchester City faced a two-year ban from the Champions League on the basis of breaching UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations (FPP). In particular, they were accused of overstating sponsorship deals. Allegedly, Manchester City owners funded much of the supposed sponsorship money they were supposed to be receiving from parties like Etihad Airways and then lied to UEFA (European soccer's ruling body) about where Manchester City got their money from. For reasons which are still unclear, the ban was recently lifted ""î the only explanation given so far is that many of the major breaches of regulation were ""útime barred.""ù These events and a lack of an explanation for the overturning clearly show the overreaching power of cash-heavy Middle Eastern investors in European soccer. Many rules, such as FPP, may be bent for them in order to suit their needs.† European soccer is essentially a pawn for Arab Gulf states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Since these two particularly are locked in a devastating power struggle, it is no surprise that football finds itself involved in the power struggle as well. Before we discuss how Arab Gulf states use soccer against each other, let's first explore the conflict's origins.† Origins of the Conflict To understand the rivalry, recall the Arab Spring of 2010-2012. This was a series of revolts which resulted in the ousting of leaders like Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak. Note that many of these uprisings stemmed from the Muslim Brotherhood, a group who believes in the unification of the Middle East under a single Islamic State ruling by Sharia law. The ruling families of Saudi Arabia and the UAE viewed the Arab Spring as a threat to their authoritarian rule and their dominance in the region. Subsequently, they banned the Brotherhood and branded them as a terrorist organization. Qatar, on the other hand, saw the Arab Spring as an opportunity to increase their geopolitical power. With Brotherhood-backed candidates winning elections in Tunisia and Egypt, Qatar saw them as the new dominating political force of the Middle East. Conveniently, the Brotherhood also happened to be banned in Qatar since 1999, and therefore they posed no threat within the country.† Qatar began to back candidates from the Muslim Brotherhood, allowing many of them to attain powerful positions. Mohamed Morsi was one such candidate from Egypt, who subsequently used his platform to criticize the repression of Brotherhood chapters in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar didn't stop there however. Over the years, Doha has been known to house several Brotherhood affiliates, such as the terrorist group Hamas. Qatari news network Al Jazeera frequently portrays the Brotherhood in a good light throughout the Middle East and beyond.† Predictably, Saudi and Emirati families were not happy with Qatar's actions. They viewed Qatar as an upstart in the region trying to take away the old power from Saudi and UAE hands. They withdrew all of their diplomats from Qatar and, in 2017, proceeded to form a five-country coalition against the Qataris. This resulted in all trade being shut off and flights being cancelled, further worsening the conflict.† Qatar's World Cup Struggle† The most glaring example of this is Qatar's efforts to undermine the Emiratis by using soccer in their bid to host the World Cup in 2022. The tournament is a symbol of the country's growing power on the international stage. By hosting the World Cup, Qatar spearheads itself as ""úthe face of the Arab World""ù to everyone else, which is naturally not something their Saudi neighbors are pleased with. For this reason, crippling Qatar's World Cup in 2022 became a top priority for the ruling Saudi and Emirati families. The leaked emails of UAE United States Ambassador, Yousef Al Otaiba, show how concerning the matter was to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. They included plans of diminishing Qatar's show in 2022 along with convincing the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) to share the tournament with the Saudis and the Emiratis.† Another dirty tactic aimed at undermining Qatar's World Cup is the Saudi and UAE's alleged anti-Doha† propaganda. A popular tactic they are accused of is giving massive funds to think tanks, who proceed to return the favor by writing damning reports of Qatar's handling of the 2022 World Cup preparations. Many such reports are published in popular news outlets such as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) or Cable News Network (CNN). They target Qatar's horrendous treatment of their migrant stadium construction workers. In addition, they question if Qatar's right to host the tournament is legitimate or if corruption and bribery was involved. While much of this bad press is legitimate, it is important to be aware of the fact that many of these reports might have been fabricated as part of the Saudi and Emirati's Cold War efforts.† The Failed Saudi Bid† A couple of months ago, a Saudi wealth fund led by Mohammed bin Salman, was in negotiations to buy Newcastle United FC. Many fans were ecstatic with the potential new owners, with the hope that new Saudi money could lure foreign stars over to their team. This led to protests from several human rights activists, citing the killing of Jamal Khashoggi as one of their reasons against the Saudi takeover. Most notably however, was Qatar's involvement. The Premier league viewing rights in the Middle East are currently owned by beIn Media Group ""î an offshoot of the Qatar-based Al Jazeera. The viewing rights make up a deal of $500 million, the second largest overseas TV deal for the Premier League.† Saudi Arabia was accused by beIn of propping up the network beoutQ and helping them pirate Premier League and World Cup matches ""î games which beIn exclusively held rights to showing. The New York Times called this ""úthe largest piracy operation in sports history.""ù To get back at the Saudis, beIn essentially snitched in a letter to all 20 Premier League teams along with the League's chief executive, mentioning beoutQ's piracy and how it traced back to the Saudis. The letter goes on to ask, ""úWhy is this important? Not only has the potential acquirer of Newcastle United caused huge damage to your club's and the Premier League's commercial revenues, but the legacy of the illegal service will continue to impact you going forward.""ù Eventually, this bad press resulted in the Saudis withdrawing from their Newcastle bid, a massive win for the Qataris.† The sport we love is undeniably turning into a battleground for rich Middle East competitors. Personally, I am not really sure how I feel about this, but I just hope it doesn't affect the game.

sports,"Despite Initial Backlash, Kaepernick's Activism Enabled Athletes' Voices",18-Nov-20,8:02 PM,['Krishan Yadav'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-11-18/despite-initial-backlash-kaepernicks-activism-enabled-athletes-voices/," On Sept. 1, 2016, Colin Kaepernick shocked the world by kneeling for the national anthem during an away game versus the Los Angeles Chargers. The initial response was met with a variety of support and criticism from many different outlets ""î some slandering his actions as unpatriotic, and others praising him for using his platform to voice his opinions on social justice by taking a stand. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with his actions, it is undeniable that he put his football career on the line with this action. This controversy created by him taking a knee during the national anthem, resulted in a nationwide discussion about narratives such as ""úshut up and dribble.""ù These conversations have allowed athletes today to take stands on social movements with increasing social acceptance. After taking a knee, Kaepernick faced a flurry of criticism. Shortly after this game, Fox News ran a story titled ""úColin Kaepernick doesn't have a clue about what ""òsacrificing everything' really means,""ù using personal attacks on Kaepernick's ""úvalidity""ù to speak about these issues. In a campaign speech, Donald Trump mentioned the situation, saying ""úWouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners ""¶ to say ""òGet that son of a bitch off the field right now,""ù referencing Kaepernick and his actions.† Kaepernick's statements have set a precedent allowing for news organizations and players to make potentially controversial statements and not face institutional criticism ""î† a big step in the right direction.† Kaepernick's statement has impacted sports in both a large and small way. On a larger scale, sports leagues such as the NBA have started publicly supporting players' stances on major social issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement, by providing a platform for their voices. Previously, major sports leagues, such as the NFL, would penalize players for speaking out about issues ""î such as when Steelers cornerback William Gay was fined for wearing purple cleats to raise awareness for domestic violence in 2015.† After his turbulent year, Kaepernick claimed to be ""òblackballed' by the owners of the NFL and has been unable to find himself on a roster. On another note, the NBA was inconspicuously silent when Lauren Ingram infamously told LeBron James to ""úshut up and dribble""ù after slandering him for comments concerning the election of Trump in 2016. †This largely contrasts with the actions taken today by the NBA and the NFL, who have shifted their stances on players' voices. When tuning into an NBA bubble game, one immediately notices the ""úBlack Lives Matter""ù banners circling the court. Courtside cameras immediately reveal social messages on the back of NBA players' jerseys, such as ""úvote""ù or ""úsay her name.""ù In an interview by Chris Paul on the impact the bubble had on players' voices, Paul stated: ""úA lot of players that may not get that notoriety [of having a huge social media presence] ""¶ got a chance to use that platform [of the NBA bubble].""ù Despite the NFL owners' amendment of the previous ruling for the national anthem ""î which limited players' freedom of speech by stating that kneeling during the anthem would result in fines from the league ""î this rule has not been enforced by the current commissioner Roger Goodell. When asked about his stance on players' voicing political or social opinion, he stated: ""úWe have never disciplined a single player for anything with the national anthem and in violation (of the policy) ""¶ And I don't intend to. And I will support them.""ù On a local level, UC Santa Barbara athletes such as JaQuori McLaughlin have exercised their voice on social issues as well. In a 30-second video broadcasted to local news channels such as KEYT NewsChannel 3, KCOY NewsChannel 12 and KKFX Fox 11, many UCSB basketball players, including McLaughlin, and community members made statements on police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. Small-scale statements like these slowly push the needle as these groups look to make lasting change.† While he faced initial backlash, public opinion on athlete activism has largely shifted because of Kaepernick. He strengthened the platform for these athletes to have a voice and laid the groundwork to help elevate athletes across America.

sports,Grading Every NBA Team's 2020 Offseason Acquisitions: Part One,3-Dec-20,11:31 AM,['Jai Uparkar'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-03/grading-every-nba-teams-2020-offseason-acquisitions-part-one/,"†  With many new faces and players coming back to the league for the shortened 2020-21 National Basketball Association (NBA) season, many teams see an opportunity to claim the Larry O'Brien trophy. Even though the Los Angeles Lakers look like clear favorites to repeat, there are always uncertainties in the NBA, as injuries and unforeseen circumstances derail a team's chances to win. Furthermore, the NBA is about to have some of its star talents back as Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and John Wall will be back on TV screens for this new season. Not only will these stars be back, but players such as Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, and Kemba Walker will also try to redeem themselves after subpar performances in the playoffs. The 2020-21 season brings with it immense pressure for the players, but the fans are all in for a season for the ages ""î please injuries and COVID-19, don't ruin this, seriously. With the offseason almost coming to an end and training camps beginning on Dec. 4, let's recap all the moves that teams have made during the busiest time of the NBA season.† † Atlanta Hawks Acquisitions:† Grade: A Evaluation: It feels right to start the grading process with an A. The Atlanta Hawks are not a team that can lure big free agents to come to play for them, which means that they must do everything in their power to keep Trae Young happy. And they did just that. Signing veteran pieces like Rondo and Gallinari will provide the Hawks with leadership and stability in the guard and forward positions. Dunn and Mays provide backup depth, and Dunn can be a great defender to pair with Young (who really needs help in that end). The biggest steal in free agency, however, was Bogdanovic. A player who is about to enter his physical peak with great playmaking and scoring abilities who fits perfectly with Young: great move Hawks! Bogdanovic checks off a lot of boxes for this young team and will play the perfect second fiddle to Young for the next four years. The only thing that kept the Hawks from getting an A+ was the selection of Okongwu. With a crowded rotation consisting of solid players like John Collins, Clint Capela and newly acquired Danilo Gallinari, Okongwu feels like a very redundant choice. But strictly by the philosophy of going with the best player available, the Hawks made a good choice and rumors are that Collins may not be in Atlanta in the near future. † Boston Celtics Acquisitions:† Grade: C Evaluation: The two moves that the Celtics made this offseason that stand out are the Tatum and Thompson signing. Locking up Tatum, who can be a possible MVP, is a must-do for the Celtics. Thompson immediately addresses the size problems that the Celtics have had since Al Horford left and they get a very solid big man who can get offensive rebounds next to a defensive center in Daniel Theis. The Teague signing gives them some nice backup depth while Nesmith and Pritchard are players who can make an immediate impact on the roster. Not only that, but Nesmith shot 52% from three at Vanderbilt last season, which is 7% better than the highest career 3-point percentage for an NBA player: Steve Kerr at 45.4%. However, the Celtics didn't do anything big and that is why they got a C. For years, we have been commending Danny Ainge's ability to accumulate assets but it is time to cash in. With two young stars in Tatum and Jaylen Brown and a great point guard in Kemba Walker, this summer is the time to strike a deal and go after a major star who can push the Celtics to the finals. Another issue was how Ainge handled Gordon Hayward's departure. Trying to get too much from the Pacers made the deal fall through and let Hayward sign a deal with the Hornets from which the Celtics got nothing.†† † Brooklyn Nets Acquisitions:† Grade: A Evaluation: Amid all the James Harden and Jrue Holiday rumors, the Brooklyn Nets did something that would help their core in the long run: maintain a deep team deserving of an A. With Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving coming from injuries, the Nets are ready to contend and win a title. But having these star players doesn't mean that they sacrifice what made their team special two years ago. The depth around Durant and Irving is what will propel this team to the Eastern Conferences' elite teams. Signing Harris and Shamet, who are great shooters and above-average defenders, is the perfect move and solidifies a rotation that is comparable to last year's Clippers (with better compliments). With a top 8 that consists of Durant, Irving, Caris Levert, Harris, Shamet, Jarrett Allen, DeAndre Jordan and Spencer Dinwiddie, this team already has a solidified rotation for the playoffs. Add to that experienced veterans like Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Taurean Prince and Bruce Brown, the Nets boast the deepest team in the NBA, and they should use that to the fullest next season ""î letting Durant and Irving slowly get back to their groove and ready for the playoffs.† † † Charlotte Hornets Acquisitions:† Grade: B- Evaluation: Charlotte Hornets and mediocrity go hand in hand. This is why the two moves that they made this offseason could be a start to something new. Drafting Ball, a guard who possesses raw talent and potential that is as close to a young Anfernee Hardaway as we've seen is a great pick for a team that rarely gets a superstar. Betting that LaMelo can blossom into a superstar and fit next to the young core of Devonte Graham, Miles Bridges and PJ Washington is the perfect move made by Michael Jordan and the Hornets. However, signing Hayward is a slightly puzzling move. For a team that gets no superstars from free agency, it makes sense why the Hornets threw the bag at Hayward. But an aging player who is coming off injuries and is probably at the end of his prime is a move that only the Hornets make. But then again, what if he performs and gives them 20-plus points per night with decent playmaking and defense? Maybe that is a good thing for a team that would like to get into the playoffs. Now you see why it's confusing. Hayward is a confusing pick and his contract and new team fit the vibe. That's why a B- is the most fitting grade for the most confusing team. I would consider bumping this up to a B because of those fabulous city edition jerseys that they unveiled, I mean damn! † Chicago Bulls Acquisitions:† Grade: B+ Evaluation: Not a lot of notable names, however, still a pretty high grade for the Bulls. Well, the Bulls need to be bad like really, really bad. Next year's draft has some potential gems like Cade Cunningham and Jalen Green, players who can be superstars. Not only do they want to get a good player, but they should also be focused on giving their young guys all the minutes. A lineup of Coby White, Zach Lavine, Otto Porter Jr, Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter sounds young and promising. With veterans like Temple, Porter and Vonleh, the young guys can learn how to play in the NBA and have long careers. Williams is a project but he fits a positional need for the Bulls. At small forward, he is a perfect fit alongside Lavine, who is a below-average defender. Offensively, his game wasn't polished but so neither was Jimmy Butler's. Let's hope Chicago can find its future small forward in Williams. A perfect floor for Williams is OG Anunoby, a defensive anchor who can give you a couple of 3-pointers and dunks each game.† † Cleveland Cavaliers Acquisitions:† Grade: B Evaluation: The Cleveland Centers, I mean, the Cleveland Cavaliers were one of the worst teams last year and have been since LeBron James left. However, the team has finally realized that overpaying role players is not the way to get into the playoffs and have embraced the tank. With one of the worst owners in the NBA, Dan Gilbert, it was surprising that the Cavaliers actually had a good draft. Okoro out of the University of Auburn is a solid player that fits perfectly next to the core of Collin Sexton, Kevin Porter Jr. and Darius Garland. Furthermore, players like Larry Nance Jr. and Andre Drummond can benefit from playing next to Okoro, who is a tenacious defender. But his offensive game does need some more work. Trading Kevin Love would have been a big deal but the Cavaliers were unable to find any suitors, which was surprising because of Love's skill set, but not surprising because of his massive contract. It looks as if a young player needs to be attached for the deal to work out, and, as of now, Cleveland would probably want to give up Garland since Sexton, Porter and Okoro seem to have more potential and fit better together as the future point guard, shooting guard and small forward for the Cavs. Signing and trading for veterans like Dellavedova and McGee is a great move and will help the locker room. This was a surprisingly good offseason for the Cavaliers but a Love trade would have made it even better.† † Dallas Mavericks Acquisitions: Grade: A+ Evaluation: After last year's playoffs, it is clear that Luka Doncic can be a one-man superstar. He was close to eliminating a loaded Los Angeles Clippers team and his talent is undeniable. The Mavericks have a future MVP on their team and the best way to keep him around for his whole career is to give him pieces that fit his play style. Doncic, a scorer who can pass and rebound the ball like a LeBron James, needs solid 3-D guys next to him. Porzingis is the perfect center alongside Doncic and can be the 2nd star that the Mavericks pair with Doncic. Thus, trading for Richardson and Johnson are the perfect moves to make for the Mavericks. Both solid 3 and D players who don't need the ball in their hands fit perfectly next to Doncic. Drafting Green provides another 3 and D piece that has a high ceiling if he can work on his offensive games. But given his physical tools and defensive versatility, there is a great fit next to Doncic. Losing Seth Curry hurts, but Tim Hardaway Jr. can be the third scorer on the team. With a starting lineup of Doncic, Hardaway, Richardson, Maxi Kleber and Porzingis with Trey Burke, Jalen Brunson, Johnson, Green, Dorian Finney-Smith and Dwight Powell off the bench, this Dallas team is deep and talented. A better tertiary scorer like Victor Oladipo or Buddy Hield would have helped but with the salary cap room left for next year, a Giannis Antetokounmpo signing could be in the works. † Denver Nuggets Acquisitions: Grade: C- Evaluation: A surprising visit to the conference finals had many people believing in the Nuggets, but their offseason was not the most convincing. A team with Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic needs some good defensive pieces, and the loss of Jerami Grant and Mason Plumlee hurts them big time. However, young guys like Michael Porter Jr.and Bol could see an increased role on the roster as the Nuggets were always criticized for having too much depth. Millsap comes back on a team-friendly deal but he isn't a piece that would push them over the top. The Nuggets could have traded for a star like Jrue Holiday or Victor Oladipo but their faith in Porter Jr. prevented them from doing so. Hopefully, Porter Jr. becomes a star or the Nuggets would be in a troubling position for the next couple of years. One bright spot for the offseason was Hampton as the Nuggets continue to grab guys off the board whose stock takes a big fall, such as Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic, etc. With Hampton, the Nuggets could have found a future shooting guard and Hampton in high school looked like a player that would go in the lottery. † Detroit Pistons Acquisitions: Grade: C+ Evaluation: At the beginning of free agency, no one had any clue as to what the Pistons were doing. Signing Grant and Plumlee while trading for Dewayne Dedmon and Bradley filled the team with a bunch of centers. Even after waiving Dedmon, the team is in a weird spot for the next year. Blake Griffin's contract is still looming on the team as the Pistons are looking to move it. However, as it stands, the Pistons look like a 10th seed at best in the east with a lot of veterans and some promising young players. Losing Christian Wood was rough since they signed Plumlee who got nearly the same yearly salary as Wood, but it didn't seem likely that Wood would stay. With Hayes and Sekou Doumbouya on the roster, the team is looking to build on the younger prospects and get ready for the future. Griffin, Rose, Grant and Plumlee could be the perfect mentors for the younger players. Wright was a decent pick up as he can play some valuable minutes at guard and help develop Hayes for the future. † Golden State Warriors Acquisitions: Grade: B+ Evaluation: After the devastating news that All-Star guard Klay Thompson would be out for the entire season with an Achilles tear, the Warriors were put in a panic mode. Thompson, who had already missed last season with an ACL injury was about to miss his second straight season. With Steph Curry and Draymond Green on the team, the Warriors couldn't go back to the tank, and decided to take the player that they liked the most, Wiseman. With Mannion slipping to them at 48th, the Warriors were set on free agency to build their team. Using the Andre Iguodala trade exception, the Warriors traded for Oubre Jr., whose game will fit perfectly with Curry's. Wanamaker and Bazemore provide bench depth and allow the Warriors to rest their stars for the playoffs. Make no mistake, this team is going to make the playoffs and challenge for a top 4 seed. With Curry on the team, anything is possible. This is the first time since the 2016 season that the Warriors have 10-11 above-average NBA players on their roster as they can march out a starting five of Curry, Andrew Wiggins, Oubre, Green and Wiseman with a bench mob that has players such as Wanamaker, Bazemore, Eric Paschall, Kevon Looney, Marquese Chriss, David Lee and Jordan Poole. This Warriors team is deep and motivated, and given their circumstances, their offseason moves were perfect. They were also granted a disabled player exception (DPE) for Thompson's injury and it looks as if they will wait until at least mid-way through the season to use it to get another quality player who could help the Warriors in the playoffs, which could potentially change their grade.†

sports,Former Gaucho Shane Bieber Takes Home Coveted Cy Young Award,4-Dec-20,10:19 AM,['Ella Wiemann'],https://dailynexus.com/2020-12-04/former-gaucho-shane-bieber-takes-home-coveted-cy-young-award/," Former UC Santa Barbara pitcher Shane Bieber was awarded the American League Cy Young Award on Nov. 11. The Cy Young Award is given each year to the best pitchers in the MLB, one recipient from the National League and another from the American League. It is voted upon by the members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Bieber pitches for the Cleveland Indians and is the first player to win the award with a unanimous vote since 2014, receiving all 30 first place votes. He is also the youngest member of the Indians to ever win the Cy Young Award. This is Bieber's third year in Major League Baseball (MLB) after being picked up by the Indians in the fourth round of the 2016 MLB draft. His MLB debut came in May of 2018 after a short stint in Minor League Baseball, thus fulfilling his dream of making a MLB roster.† Bieber walked on to the UCSB baseball team in 2013 and quickly excelled, earning a scholarship by his sophomore year. He was coached under Coach Andrew Checketts who has been UCSB's head coach for the baseball program since 2011. In the 2015 season at UCSB, Bieber was eighth in the NCAA for fewest walks issued per nine innings and was 10th in strikeout to walk ratio ""î the number of strikeouts a pitcher has thrown divided by the number of walks he has allowed. Bieber is the second former UCSB pitcher to win the Cy Young Award. Barry Zito, who pitched for the team in 1997, won the award while playing for the Oakland Athletics in 2002.† Along with the Cy Young Award, Bieber also was awarded with the MLB Players Choice American League Outstanding Pitcher as well as the American League's August Pitcher of the Month this year. Bieber led or tied all other MLB pitchers this season with his outstanding performance in earned run average (ERA), strikeouts and wins, earning himself the American League ""úTriple Crown""ù of pitching. Bieber led the league with 8 wins, 122 strikeouts and a 1.63 ERA. Bieber also made MLB history as the quickest to ever accomplish 100 strikeouts in a season, reaching 100 strikeouts in only 62.1 innings. This year both the American League and National League Cy Young Awards were granted to former players from the UC system. Trevor Bauer, now a free agent, won the award with the Cincinnati Reds and formerly pitched for UCLA.

sports,Gauchos Fall to 0-2 in Conference Play After Tough Loss to Anteaters,2-Jan-21,2:31 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-02/gauchos-fall-to-0-2-in-conference-play-after-tough-loss-to-anteaters/,"Allison Fann/Daily Nexus Despite a career-high 19 points from freshman guard Alyssa Marin, the UCSB women's basketball team dropped their sixth consecutive game after their 69-56 loss to UC Irvine. With the loss, the Gauchos fall to 0-6 on the year and 0-2 in the conference, while the Anteaters improve to 4-4 overall and 2-0 in the conference. After a close loss last night to Irvine, UCSB played the Anteaters tough for much of the night. Importantly, the Gauchos got Irvine big Sophia Locandro into foul trouble early. In the first quarter, Irvine largely tried to funnel their offense through the sophomore big, eager to take advantage of the Gauchos' lack of size in the paint. While Locandro put up 8 of her 10 total points in the first quarter, that strategy would ultimately backfire when Locandro picked up her third foul in the second quarter. But even without Locandro for much of the night, the Anteaters proved to be too lengthy for the ""òChos. In total, Irvine outrebounded Santa Barbara 41-30; perhaps most tellingly, the Anteaters outscored the Gauchos 50-10 in the paint on the night. Still, Santa Barbara managed to hang around due to their proficiency behind the arc. In the first half, UCSB hit 6 three-pointers, accounting for 18 of their 28 points. In particular, Marin was lethal from deep, scoring 12 of her 19 points from behind the arc. After a late 13-5 second quarter run from Irvine, the Gauchos found themselves down 33-28 at the half. In the third quarter, however, the wheels fell off a bit for the Gauchos. Early in the quarter, senior guard Danae Miller picked up a knock. Miller ""î who averages 12.3 points per game ""î was eager to re-enter the game, but Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson and the coaching staff opted to hold her out for the remainder of the game for precautionary reasons. Without their starting point guard on the floor, the Gauchos offense struggled to find a rhythm. In the quarter, the ""òChos turned the ball over seven times; more importantly, Irvine took advantage, scoring easy buckets in transition. ""úWe just weren't getting the ball stopped [after the turnovers],""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe're not matching up in transition""ù. In total, Irvine outscored UCSB 15-5 in transition points, while also turning the ball over 10 less times than the Gauchos. After a 21-10 third quarter advantage, Irvine easily cruised en-route to its 69-56 victory over Santa Barbara. Despite the 0-6 start to the season, UCSB was still hustling until the final whistle on Monday. Still, it was the fundamentals that propelled Irvine past Santa Barbara, with the Anteaters winning the rebounding and turnover battle by a sizable margin.

sports,A Hopeful Future for US Soccer?,15-Jan-21,9:53 AM,['Vir Pathak'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-15/a-hopeful-future-for-us-soccer/," After an impressive performance in 2014, the state of the U.S. men's national soccer team came crashing down after failing to qualify for the 2018 edition of the World Cup. Most embarrassing was the way in which they managed to fail ""î they only had to draw against minnows Trinidad and Tobago. This was widely seen as the final nail in the coffin for U.S. Soccer.† With the pandemic canceling the majority of events in 2020, many events were shifted to 2021. The United States men's national soccer team will be playing in a large number of international friendlies, competing in the CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament and will also begin their qualifying campaign for the 2022 World Cup. The hype surrounding the current crop of United States players is reaching heights unheard of in U.S. Soccer. Here is how the team has evolved from its state in 2014 to where it is now. †More Players Starting Their Careers in Europe† For most of U.S. soccer history, the usual route for a player was to start his career in college or in the MLS. This is gradually losing its popularity, with many young players opting to move to Europe and begin their careers there. One of the most high profile examples is Christian Pulisic, a Pennsylvania native who moved to Germany to play for Borussia Dortmund when he was only 16. Pulisic is now a winger for Chelsea F.C. and arguably the United States' best player. While risky, choosing to move to Europe at a young age can prove to be a crucial stepping stone for a player's career. Players such as Pulisic have gone on to play in top European teams and the UEFA Champions League. This means they have exposure to the highest level of soccer there is, and the experience which they gather as a result makes a massive difference to the national team. †Grassroots Development† Many view the MLS as a ""úretirement league""ù for top players to play in once they are too old for European leagues. As a result, the MLS has generally been full of older foreign players. But in recent years we have seen an increasing number of players come on the MLS scene out of youth academies. This shows that the American teams are taking more of an interest in developing players at the grassroots level.† As a result, top youngsters are able to begin their professional careers at an earlier age. Many have been able to use the MLS as a springboard to get to Europe. Tyler Adams, for example, was a product of the New York Red Bulls before he moved to German side ""úRed Bull""ù Leipzig. Last season, his team made it to the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Perhaps the most high profile example of an MLS product is Canada's Alphonso Davies, who won the Champions League last season with Bayern Munich. †With these new initiatives, I think U.S. Soccer is definitely headed in the right direction. American players are getting more exposure to the highest levels of the game by getting more chances to play for European teams. This can only translate to more international success.

sports,"After Tough Loss, Gauchos Look to Rebound Against Aggies",27-Jan-21,10:12 PM,['Ella Wiemann'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-27/after-tough-loss-gauchos-look-to-rebound-against-aggies/,"Angie Banks/Daily Nexus Coming off a tough loss against UC San Diego last week, the UCSB women's basketball team will return to the Thunderdome for a two-game homestand starting this Friday. The Gauchos will be taking on the No. 2 Big West Conference team, the UC Davis Aggies.† UCSB comes to the game with a 2-7 overall record and 3-2 conference record, after narrowly losing to the UCSD Tritons by 73-71 in the final five seconds of the fourth quarter last Saturday. UC Davis will be tough to beat, as they are currently undefeated in the conference at 2-0 and have an overall record of 3-0 after defeating the University of San Francisco in November and beating UC San Diego twice last week. The Aggies have won the Big West Conference for four years in a row and are certainly on track to dominate this season as well.† The UC Davis Aggies are currently averaging 73.3 points per game, with 6'3""ù post player Sage Stobbart leading the team with an average of 15 points per game. Stobbart, a junior from North Vancouver, British Columbia, will be the one to watch in the upcoming game against UCSB. The Atlanta Tipoff Club announced on Tuesday that Stobbart was one of 15 Division I athletes to be named to the Naismith Women's Defensive Player of the Year watch list. She is one of four players from a non-""úPower Five""ù conference to make the list. Stobbart's recognition is well deserved as she currently leads the nation in blocks per game (4.0 bpg) after recording 12 blocks in her last 3 games.† The Gauchos will look to redeem themselves against UC Davis this weekend after losing to the Aggies twice in the 2019-20 season. Additionally, following UCSB's loss against UCSD last week, UCSB's Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson hopes to improve upon their performance in their next game. † ""úOur defensive intensity wasn't where it needed to be,""ù Henrickson said. ""úWe were slow to loose balls and gave up offensive rebounds. We've got to finish possessions and keep playing.""ù True to Henrickson's words, the Gauchos have struggled on the defensive end this season, allowing 73.6 points against them per game. Perhaps more importantly, UCSB is getting outrebounded by more than 8 rebounds per game; without fixing these two issues, Santa Barbara will continue to struggle in conference play. Gaucho junior guard/forward Taylor Mole will be pivotal in these corrections as she leads the team in both points per game and rebounds, with 16.2 and 8.8, respectively. Senior guard Danae Miller (#0) will also be a crucial component against UC Davis with her average of 4.4 assists per game ""î the most among any of the Gauchos.† UCSB will play UC Davis at 4 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 29, and again at 4 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 30, this weekend.†

While that probably overstates how much we really liked talking to people in the first place, quarantine has irrefutably provided us with a vast surplus of time to absorb the nearly endless content of Netflix. Amongst the rom-coms, action movies and musicals, a particular show stands out as especially eye-opening for American audiences: ""úDrive to Survive,""ù an unprecedented behind-the-scenes docuseries about the fastest sports race on Earth, the Formula One World Championship.† For those who are unfamiliar with the term, the Formula One (Formula 1) World Championship is the highest class of racing in the world sanctioned by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Its competition season spans across 10 months and six continents as the best drivers in the world duke it out for the coveted Formula 1 drivers' championship title.† Although not nearly as popular in the U.S. as other sports like football and basketball, Formula 1 racing is actually one of the most popular sports in the world, attracting 1.9 billion viewers during the 2019 season.† Beginning this March, the next 23-race season promises to be jam-packed with high-octane and high-adrenaline action as the best drivers in the world return to the grid in a championship fight that is predicted to be one of the closest in this era. So now, with two ""î rumored three ""î seasons of ""úDrive to Survive""ù on Netflix and before the 2021 championship kicks off in Sakhir, Bahrain, it might be the perfect time to get caught up on the world of Formula 1. Here are three reasons why you should join the growing legion of stateside Formula 1 fans. † Formula 1 is perhaps one of the easiest sports to follow. Races only occur on Sundays every one to three weeks, giving teams enough time to trot the globe to prepare for the next race. There are only 20 Formula 1 drivers in the world ""î two drivers per the 10 total teams ""î a testament to the niche prestige that participants hold.† Even better, the scoring is simple: The top 10 drivers in each race earn points ranging from 25 for first place and 1 for 10th, and at the end of the season, the driver with the most points is crowned the driver's champion. The team with the most points ""î the sum of the points of both their drivers ""î is crowned the constructor's champion. † 2. The Spectacle † Watching the Formula 1 cars roar down the track is exhilarating, even when you're just viewing them on your TV. These cars are the pinnacle of automotive engineering, capable of turning a corner faster than any other machine with wheels ever made. The turbo-hybrid engines achieve acceleration levels that will only be surpassed by the next generation of Formula 1 cars. The races are full of difficult passes, close calls and fiery collisions unlike anything else seen in the world of sports. Formula 1 broadcasts radio conversations with drivers and race strategists, allowing viewers to see and hear about on-track drama from multiple perspectives in real time.† The scenery itself is a defining characteristic of Formula 1. Previous seasons have featured races on the historic streets of Monaco, the dunes of Sakhir and the gorgeous countryside of Monza, just to name a few. With the in-depth track analysis and aerial views provided by the televised races, fans of Formula 1 are treated to an up-close and personal look at some of the most culturally significant regions and tracks in the world. † 3) The Technology For those who are excited by engineering and innovation, or who are just fascinated by real-time strategy, Formula 1 is your place. Formula 1 is different from other racing series like NASCAR in that the teams engineer their own racing cars. This means that the technical direction of teams makes a significant impact on their performances on the track. Fans are in turn able to see for themselves the effects of having different approaches in creating every aspect of each car, from the aerodynamic package to the braking system and everything in between.† As aforementioned, Formula 1 gives viewers access to information on a level incomparable to that of any other sport. The television broadcast shares with viewers the same real-time calculations and performance metrics of the cars that the teams use when formulating their racing strategies. Simply put, this situation would be analogous to an NFL broadcast literally saying what the next play will be before it even happens. The abundance of information allows the Formula 1 viewer to be fully immersed in the high-speed action and put their technical and strategic knowledge to the test to see if their predictions match the actions of the teams.† bruh

sports,"McLaughlin, Gauchos Travel to Davis to Take on Aggies",28-Jan-21,7:31 PM,['Oliver Bley'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-01-28/mclaughlin-gauchos-travel-to-davis-to-take-on-aggies/,"After a seven-week layoff and 11 consecutive game cancellations due to health and safety protocols instilled by Yolo County, the UC Davis Aggies will host the Gauchos on Friday and Saturday for an inter-conference doubleheader. Coach Joe Pasternack's boys had an impressive prior week, which saw them outscore the CSUN Matadors by a combined 69 points over two games and push their unbeaten run to six games. Senior guard JaQuori McLaughlin continued making his case for Big West Conference Player of the Year by earning his fifth Player of the Week honor after averaging 23 PTS, 4 REB and shooting an outstanding 67% on 3PFG over the two games. Junior forward Amadou Sow continues to dominate the paint on both ends of the court and will go for his fifth consecutive double-double against the Aggies while striving to extend his substantial lead atop the Big West rebounding charts. The Aggies, who split their series at UC San Diego, are led by last year's Big West Freshman of the Year Ezra Manjon, who in only six games is the conferences' second-leading scorer at 17.8 PPG. The matchup with UCSB comes at a perfect time, as he and Sow were both added to the Lou Henson Award Preseason Watch List, which is presented annually to the top mid-major player in Division I. Aggies coach Jim Les is a former scrappy NBA guard, who interestingly played on the 1989-1990 Santa Barbara Islanders team that lasted one season in the CBA, the NBA's development league at the time. In their two conference games so far, he has employed undersized starting lineups that include players like 6'7""ù Kennedy Koehler and 6'5""ù Caleb Fuller in the frontcourt. Koehler's potential matchup with Sow in the post could be exciting, as the senior Aggie is second in the Big West in blocks per game. As Les' former playing style suggests, the Aggies thrive off of free throws and streaky 3-point shooting. Despite the limited sample of games, the team already leads the Big West in team FT% (79.9) and is coming off making nine 3-pointers against the Tritons last Saturday.† With the Aggies clearly taking any size mismatch on paper with a grain of salt and continuously seeking to attack the rim, it will be important for Sow, junior forward Miles Norris and other frontcourt players in particular to stay out of foul trouble. If Sow does play solid minutes in both matchups, he could become UCSB's 30th 1000-point scorer in school history. Currently, he is 35 points away from surpassing that benchmark. Friday and Saturday's games between UCSB and UC Davis will tip off at 4 p.m. at The Pavillion.

sports,Gauchos Look to Knock Off Red-Hot Long Beach State,2-Feb-21,8:08 PM,['Tiberius Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-02/gauchos-look-to-knock-off-red-hot-long-beach-state/,"Estef Zuniga / Daily Nexus Last weekend the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team took close losses against the defending Big West Conference champions UC Davis during a tightly contested two-game series. Following this exhausting weekend, the Gauchos are looking to rebound this Friday and Saturday against Long Beach State. The Gauchos enter this weekend with a 2-9 overall record and 9th place in the Big West after this weekend's tough losses brought their conference record to 2-5.The matchup against the conference frontrunner Long Beach State will prove to be an intense contest, with the only blemish on their 9-1 overall record coming from a 6 point non-conference loss to the Trojans back in December. With three more conference wins than the second ranked UC Irvine Anteaters, Long Beach will be sure to come into this game determined to build their conference lead even more. The Beach are in the midst of their longest win streak since the 2014-15 season, having won eight games in a row ""î the most recent of which was a confidence-boosting away series against the UC San Diego Tritons. Although the first game was won by narrow margins in the final possessions, in the second game, Jasmine Hardy, Long Beach's offensive powerhouse, tied her season-high scoring record with 17 points, and was joined by four other players who scored in the double digits. In their last game, Long Beach shot 45.6% from the field and 38.9% from the arc, indicating the team has begun to hit their stride on the perimeter. UCSB is ready for the challenge however, and is looking to repeat their previous performance against the Beach, which was a decisive home victory in the 2020 regular season closer. Although this weekend's games will be held in the famous Walter Pyramid in Long Beach, the drive to win will remain the same ""î a drive that is shared by all team members. This was proven during the first game against the Aggies, a game that was only lost by a single bucket largely due to an incredibly productive bench that outscored the UC Davis bench 12-2. Further, Coach Hendrickson has expressed excitement about the rising play of freshman Anya Choice.† ""úWe like the fact that she'll raise up and knock down some three's because that opens up her opportunity to drive,""ù Henrickson said after Choice shot 66% from downtown in the Saturday matchup against the Aggies.† With an ascending freshman shooter in Choice, the continued excellence of junior Taylor Mole and senior Danae Miller, as well as a highly competitive bench, the conditions may just be ripe for an upset against Long Beach.† The Gauchos will tip-off against Long Beach at 4:00 pm on Friday and Saturday in the Walter Pyramid at the CSU Long Beach campus.

sports,What to Watch For: 2021 Australian Open,6-Feb-21,8:20 PM,['Tiberius Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-06/what-to-watch-for-2021-australian-open/," After a year marked by hardship, the nation of Australia is once again opening its borders to the best tennis athletes in the world as they descend to Melbourne for the 109th edition of the Australian Open. In a sport with so many athletes and matches happening at once, it can be difficult to keep up with the action, so here's a quick rundown of the players to look out for as the first Grand Slam of the 2021 tennis season kicks off. † Sofia Kenin: The defending Australian Open champion from the United States is looking to repeat the magic that propelled her to her first Grand Slam title one year ago. Having never been ranked above 4th in the world, the American must persevere through uphill battles against tournament favorites if she is to win the Australian Open in a repeat upset fashion. Armed with a brutal forehand and having some of the best speed on the tour, Kenin's prospects for at least a semifinal run seem strong, but she first will have to overcome rising stars in her opening matches in order to get there.† † Novak Djokovic: The defending Australian Open champion had an utterly dominant 2020 season, with the Serb finishing at the world No. 1 ranking and a staggering record of 41-5. Unsurprisingly, Djokovic is favored to win the Australian Open yet again, especially with Roger Federer still recovering from surgery and Rafael Nadal struggling against Djokovic on hard courts. However, with a draw that is filled with youthful and ambitious talent as well as a PR struggle after a series of off-court controversies, a Djokovic victory down under is anything but guaranteed. † Serena Williams: The greatest American tennis player of all time (that's right, I said it) returns to Melbourne in pursuit of history, as a tournament victory would see her tie Margaret Court's all-time Grand Slam singles title record of 24. Even after a disappointing third round exit in last year's Australian Open and struggling in the subsequent Grand Slam tournaments, I expect the icon to enter 2021 determined to get back to her play at a level unparalleled by anyone in the game. Just like on the men's side, however, a title run would require fending off a draw full of talented younger players eager to make a name for themselves. † Rafael Nadal: After withdrawing from an ATP Cup match on Feb. 2 due to back stiffness, there is some speculation that the Spaniard may not be in the best condition for the Australian Open. Nonetheless, some sources indicate that these concerns are likely overblown, and that Nadal will be in peak condition for the tournament. Known for his power and fierce intensity, Nadal has even more conviction to play as hard as ever: A title here would break the tie between him and Federer's current Grand Slam record of 20, which would make Nadal the new record holder of the man with the most Grand Slam singles titles. † Naomi Osaka: International phenom Osaka is rolling off a busy 2020, winning her second U.S. Open and making deep runs into all the Slams. An advocate of racial justice in the world stage, the young Haitian-Japanese American star is quickly becoming the international face of the sport and is always a crowd favorite. Following a brief off-season, Osaka is highly likely to make yet another deep run into the Australian Open, but will have to win difficult matches against higher-ranked top seeds if she is to gain the title. † Nick Kyrgios: Infamous in the tennis world for being the ""úbad boy""ù of the sport, the Australian Kyrgios will return to the stage of Grand Slam tennis after taking much of 2020 off due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other personal reasons. With a fiery personality and unreal talent, a match starring Kyrgios is always an entertaining blockbuster that will captivate the most seasoned tennis fans as well as the casual observers. Younger viewers be warned: The Aussie holds the record for largest fine ever conferred for on-court activity ""î $113,000 for audible obscenities and smashing racquets during a match in 2019. † Ashleigh Barty: Reigning No. 1 in the world, Barty is another player who is traveling to Melbourne after taking an extended hiatus due to the pandemic, during which she missed both the U.S. and French Open in 2020. Given that the rankings are in a temporarily frozen state due to the pandemic, the Australian is projected to take the top seed in the tournament. This means that she'll be playing easier opening matches, but as she gets deeper into the open, Barty will eventually square off against players who have been more active in recent months. † Dominic Thiem: Thiem of Austria holds the special distinction of being the only man on earth born in the 1990s to have won a Grand Slam singles title, a living testament to the sustained dominance of the much older Federer, Nadal and Djokovic. Having won the 2020 U.S. Open last September in a spectacular comeback fashion, the Austrian is entering the Australian Open with bolstered confidence, but also apprehension. The 2020 U.S. Open was a tournament with a less competitive field due to COVID-19 and an early disqualification of Djokovic. So, if Thiem is to win in the coming weeks, he will likely have a much more difficult time winning than in September. † The 109th Australian Open kicks off on Feb. 8 in Melbourne, Australia, and will run for two weeks, with the women's singles final being scheduled for Feb. 20 and the men's singles final scheduled for Feb. 21. Televised matches can be found on ESPN and the Tennis Channel. Comments are closed.

The Gauchos' losing streak will increase to five as their COVID-19 opt-outs from the beginning of the year continue to take a toll.†† Although UCSB kept it close in the first half of Friday's game, the Gauchos ultimately gave up 35 points in the second half and went on to lose by 12 points. Saturday's game was a different story, as UCSB was facing a 17-point deficit as the first-half buzzer sounded. Giving up that many points has been a worrying trend for the Gauchos, as they continue to be one of the worst defensive teams in the Big West.† In both games, the Gauchos had quick starts, as they built small first-quarter leads. However, the Beach took control the rest of the way, as their size and suffocating zone defense overwhelmed UCSB. In both games combined, the Gauchos only lead for two minutes and 25 seconds.† UCSB struggled to box out Long Beach in their first game, as Long Beach grabbed 8 more offensive rebounds than the Gauchos. Although there was improvement the next day, Long Beach still had 5 more total rebounds than UCSB. The Gauchos also struggled with their interior defense, as they gave up a combined 72 points in the paint.† In their defeats, UCSB was led by Taylor Mole, who averaged a team-leading 17 points-per-game while shooting 41% from the field and 27% past the three-point line, while Lauren Lee led the team in assists with 3 per game. For the Beach, players hit individual milestones, as Long Beach guard Justina King had a career-high 9 assists in Saturday's game, while the rest of the team only combined for 7.† The Gauchos had issues with their ball security as they followed up their 16 turnover performance on Friday with 15 more the next day. In contrast, Long Beach improved in this regard, as they gave up the ball 11 times and then lowered that number to only 6 on Saturday. Next week, Long Beach State will stay at home to face the UC Davis Aggies, while the Gauchos will look to end their losing streak at five games as they come back to Santa Barbara to take on the struggling Hawai'i Rainbow Wahines.†

sports,UCSB Women's Basketball Team Looks to Break Rough Spell Against Hawai'i,12-Feb-21,5:30 PM,['Oliver Bley'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-12/ucsb-womens-basketball-team-looks-to-break-rough-spell-against-hawaii/,"In this unconventional season, the Gauchos surely miss fan energy at the Thunderdome. Remaining the only Big West team without a home win, Basketball Coach Bonnie Henrickson's ladies will welcome the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa for a weekend doubleheader on Friday and Saturday afternoon. The 6-game losing streak to start the season, and current 5-game winless run for the Gauchos does not paint the full picture. Out of their 7 conference losses, 3 games were decided by 4 points or less. For a team that led the Big West in scoring defense and rebounding margin last year before the onset of the pandemic, the presence of sophomore center-forward Ila Lane is surely missed. Providing an astonishing average of 13.0 rebounds per game (RPG) to go along with consistent double-digit scoring, last year's Big West Freshman of the Year probably could have altered some of those results. However, junior forward Taylor Mole and redshirt senior guard Doris Jones deserve tons of credit for stepping up in this department. Both rank within the top 25 in RPG, with Mole leading the entire conference at 9.4 RPG.† Unfortunately, the entire team sits last in average rebounding margin and steals per game, which could be attributed to players needing to embrace increased minutes. Mole and senior point guard Danae Miller, for example, played all 40 minutes in last Friday's game against Long Beach State. The Hawai'i Rainbow Wahine make the short trip to Isla Vista after splitting their weekend series with Cal Poly. Their head coach ""î Laura Beeman ""î is a Southern California native with an intriguing resume that includes previous stints in the Women's National Basketball Association, the Pac-12 Conference and the South Coast Community College Conference. The 2014-2015 Big West Coach of the Year has garnered over 130 wins in 9 seasons so far at Hawai'i. Redshirt senior wing-forward Amy Atwell, has arguably been one of the conference's deadliest shooters. After leading the Big West with a 45.3% 3-point field goal last season, she rose to 6th all-time in the conference record book before the start of this season. Although she has cooled down to 33.3% thus far in 2020-2021, she always remains a threat. Look for Atwell to work in tandem with senior guard Jadynn Alexander. After being named to the Big West All-Defensive Team a year ago, she has flashed on offense and nearly doubled her scoring average. With each of them attempting a season-high 12 3-pointers on either Friday or Saturday last week, the Gaucho defense will need to be stout on the perimeter. The Wahine employ effective defensive schemes. They allow 62.4 points a game on average in conference play and are second in defensive rebounding (25.7 DRPG). Beeman may choose to employ variations of a box-one zone to foil the Gaucho's impressive 3-point success, as Mole, Jones, Miller, freshman guards Alyssa Marin and Anya Choice are all top-20 in conference 3PT%. This matchup should stir excitement, as the team's play-styles are quite similar. If both coaches look to cut off attempts from deep, we could see more drives to the bucket, and thus, crucial free-throw attempts. Allison Fann/Daily Nexus This series could also precede another potential matchup in the upcoming Big West Tournament in Las Vegas, where every conference team will be allowed to attend due to COVID-19 cancellations. Likely out of contention for a top seed, the Gauchos and Wahine may battle in an early round matchup in an attempt to gain momentum for a deep run.† Friday and Saturday's games tip off at 5 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

Angie Banks / Daily Nexus The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team secured their tenth win a row ""î the longest streak for the team since Joe Pasternack started as head coach ""î† following back-to-back victories against University of Hawaii. The Gauchos' 59-50 Friday win was their lowest-scoring game of the season, though the guys bounced back to defeat the home team 81-74 in overtime on Saturday. Santa Barbara, now holding a 14-3 overall and 8-2 conference record, sits in the number one spot of the Big West Conference.† Senior JaQuori McLaughlin and junior Amadou Sow came out of the weekend as UCSB's top scorers, throwing 62 points onto the board. 30 points from Sow earned the forward a spot in UCSB history as the 30th Gaucho to join the 1,000-point club. Another 31 points from McLaughlin leaves the guard just 6 points away from the same title. On top of his 9 added assists, he is on track to become only the third Gaucho to have 1,000 points and 300 assists.† Senior guard Devearl Ramsey joined the two on the leaderboard in Saturday's game, going 10-10 on the free-throw line and securing an additional 7 points from the court. An effective Gaucho offense proved itself to be crucial in Saturday's win. Overall, the team shot with 54% efficiency compared to their opponent's 45.1% and bested the Rainbow Warriors in points in the paint 46-24.† Throughout the first half, neither the Gauchos nor the Warriors were able to make significant breaks and kept within 6 points of one another. It wasn't until the last five minutes that UCSB's defense kicked in and its offense picked up the pace, catching a 16-point stride while holding Hawaii to just 3 points. UCSB's momentum carried well into the second half, at one point pulling 16 points away from Hawaii.† However, an abrupt change in momentum left the Gauchos struggling to hold onto their lead; a jump shot to put Hawaii up and a quick responding dunk from UCSB junior Miles Norris tied the game 62-62 in the last two minutes of the half, sending the game into overtime.† McLaughlin kicked off the overtime period with a clean 3-point jump shot in the first 30 seconds, and dinged a few more free throws and jump shots in the rest of the period. Ramsey secured 8 points in free throws alone, including the Gauchos' final 2 points and securing a victory.† Friday's game played out much differently. The Gaucho offense struggled to put numbers on the board, putting significant pressure on its defensive performance. UCSB saw a significant change in its field goal percentage, hitting just 36.7% of shots on Friday compared to 53.7% on Saturday. Nonetheless, the Gauchos held a steady lead the entire game ""î 37 rebounds on top of a season-low 7 turnovers kept the Warriors from ever pulling ahead.† Sophomore reserve Josh Pierre-Louis entered the game around the 15-minute mark and made aggressive efforts at the rim and from the field in the first half. A layup, a 3-pointer and a pair of steals marked his time on the court. Another layup in the second half would take UCSB to its biggest lead of the game, 37-24. In total, the sophomore contributed 11 points, the third-highest scorer behind teammates Sow and McLaughlin.† This week, the Gauchos are coming back home to the Thunderdome to host Cal State Bakersfield in another set of back-to-back games. Bakersfield, ranked second in Big West and holding a 14-7 overall and a 8-4conference record, is coming off of a hot two wins against UC San Diego. However, a victory against the Gauchos will be a tough feat given that Santa Barbara has yet to lose a home turf match. Game one is set for Friday, Feb. 19 at 8:00 pm.†

Nexus File Photo After almost a full year since last season's senior night win against Cal State Long Beach, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team won their first home game at the Thunderdome on Saturday evening. After an extremely disappointing 72-62 loss on Friday, senior guard Doris Jones' 23 points propelled the team to a statement 22-point (72-50) victory the following evening.† Friday evening's disappointment stemmed largely from UCSB being unable to continue its second-quarter momentum after the halftime break. Down 24-18 after one, the Gauchos clamped down on defense and did not concede a bucket until Hawai'i forward Kasey Neubert's layup at the 6:25 mark. Despite garnering four offensive rebounds in that scoreless stretch for Hawai'i, Jones was the only one that converted an extra possession into points. Hawai'i ended the quarter with a mere 3 points on 8.3% shooting, which has to be one of the lowest offensive outputs in recent Big West history. It did an excellent job masking the fact that the Gauchos only shot 2-13 on three-pointers in the first half.† The unfortunate trends relating to rebounding and three-point shooting bled into the second half for the Gauchos, which allowed the Wahine to easily overcome an 8-point halftime deficit. Scoring runs of 10-0 and 8-0, they established momentum that UCSB would be unable to overcome. While the Wahine lead remained under double digits for the majority of the play, the final box score outlined their deserved victory. A +17 rebounding margin (40-23) allowed coach Laura Beeman's girls to nearly double the Gauchos in second-chance points (9-5) and points in the paint (40-24). Daejah Phillips and Neubert both ended with 19 points, with the latter also notching a career-high 15 rebounds. Gaucho forward Taylor Mole added another impressive double-double to her resume with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Saturday night was a whole other story, as the Gauchos showed great improvements with their rebounding, as well as capitalizing on Wahine foul tendencies. The team drew 8 personal fouls in the first quarter and converted all but one of their attempts at the line. In the second, Jones and Alyssa Marin contributed 4 of the 6 total offensive rebounds, which this time, tended to turn into successful layups or kick-outs to open shooters. Down only 29-35 at the break, the Wahine would be in store for a miserable second half at the hands of Jones and company. In ten third-quarter minutes, Jones' 12 points, 2 rebounds and 2 assists sparked a level of offensive cohesion and efficiency that the Gauchos had lacked for some time. The Wahine could hardly blink before the score margin reached double digits. Only 6 points (on 3-17 shooting), coupled with 5 personal fouls and 5 turnovers, saw the Wahine down 27 (62-35) at the end of three. The fourth quarter thus allowed coach Bonnie Henrickson to extend some slight rest for the majority of her starters. The emphatic 72-50 victory, showed how efficiently the team improved on its mistakes from Friday. Aside from matching Hawaii's bruising playstyle and scoring well in the paint, the Gauchos put up 23 points off of turnovers and nearly tripled their second-chance point output (13) from the night before. Alyssa Marin's season-high 5 assists also allowed UCSB to excel in transition. The series split places the Gauchos at 3-8 in the Big West (3-12 overall), while the Wahine drop back below .500 at 4-5 (5-6 overall). Next weekend, the Gauchos travel to CSU Bakersfield to take on the Roadrunners, while Hawai'i heads back to Honolulu for a week off due to the COVID-19 opt outs that forced Cal State Northridge women's hoops to cancel their season in early November. Their next game is not until Friday, Feb. 26 at Cal State Long Beach.

sports,"Despite Brady's Latest Title, Williams Remains G.O.A.T.",26-Feb-21,12:48 PM,['Jai Uparkar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-26/despite-bradys-latest-title-williams-remains-g-o-a-t/," Arguments over which athlete is the Greatest of All Time have been hotly contested time and time again. This debate was revitalized after Tom Brady, at the age of 43 and after moving to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, won his 7th Super Bowl title.† Given his old age, ability to bring a national championship to Tampa Bay after 18 years and dominant wins, the Internet was buzzing with claims of Brady being the Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) As these claims surfaced, huge rebuttals surfaced on Twitter and TikTok as to why and how Serena Williams, not Brady, is the G.O.A.T.† First, let's bring out their stats. Williams has won 4 Olympic gold medals and a total of 39 Grand Slam titles ""î 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and 2 in mixed doubles. Out of the multitude of records that she holds, some of the most impressive include holding the second most Grand Slam singles titles, being the oldest player to hold the No. 1 women's ranking and being the only person in history to win 3 of the 4 Grand Slams 6 times. Her powerful style of playing and athleticism revolutionized women's tennis forever.† Brady's humble beginnings as the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of the NFL Draft is nothing but inspirational. He's appeared in the Super Bowl 10 times, having won 7 of those titles. Brady led the Patriots to 17 division titles. He is the NFL leader in career passing yards, attempts, completions and touchdown passes. While he holds a myriad of other records, he also holds the record for career quarterback wins, quarterback playoff wins and Super Bowl MVP awards. He's the only quarterback to win a Super Bowl in three different decades and has won more Super Bowls than any other NFL franchise. After Super Bowl LV, he became the player with the most championships in NFL history. It's clear by looking at both of these athletes that age is just a number. Williams is currently 39 years old, a mother and still making consistent appearances at Grand Slam finals and winning tournaments. At the age of 43, Brady has just won his 7th Super Bowl. Moreover, he is the oldest starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl, a Super Bowl MVP, and a league MVP. Regardless of their impressive achievements, longevity,and transcendence in their respective sports,† Williams is by far a more impressive and iconic athlete than Brady. Williams competes in the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), a worldwide professional tennis tour for women. For the past 25 years, Williams has been competing with the best female tennis athletes in the world and consistently outplaying them to win the most prestigious and important tennis tournaments (Grand Slams). Brady, on the other hand, competes in the NFL, a professional American football league with only 32 teams. Brady is only competing with the best football athletes in America, at a national level. Although football is considered to be an American sport, there are about 80 countries around that world that have organized federations for the sport.† Secondly, Williams has come to dominate her individual sport. It is Williams, and absolutely no one else, who is responsible for her success and wins on the court. She has no teammates to rely on and depend on to win. Everything she does on the court is the product of her talents alone, and no one else's. Brady, however, plays a team sport. Everything he does as a quarterback is contingent on the abilities of his frontline players, wide receivers and running backs. All of Brady's wins have come from the talents of his teammates, not just his own. Albeit, tennis and football are completely different sports, but the amount of Grand Slams Williams has won and the dominance she has held over an individual sport for the past 20 years is more impressive than anything Brady has done.† Moreover, Williams won her 2017 Australian Open title while being eight weeks pregnant. After giving birth to her daughter in 2017, Williams' life was in critical danger from developing blood clots which required multiple surgeries and caused her to be bed ridden for weeks. After childbirth, most female athletes are not able to return to the same level at which they once played. While managing motherhood and tennis, Williams has managed to reach 4 Grand Slams finals but has been unable to win any of those finals.†† Both of these athletes have transformed their sport and will be remembered for years to come. But claiming that Tom Brady is the G.O.A.T. is an injustice and a disservice to Serena Williams, a Black woman who overcame a great deal of racism to dominate in a primarily white sport. Her longevity and dominance in the sport has made her an international icon identifiable by just her first name. Williams is simply the G.O.A.T. No question about it.† Comments are closed.

With this win, the Gauchos improved their record to 4-12 overall and 4-8 in Big West Conference play. UCSB remains at No. 8 in the Big West, while CSU Bakersfield dropped to No. 5 in the conference.† The Gauchos were seen throughout the game consistently holding up three fingers in the air as they ran back to play defense, signifying a made 3-point field goal. In total, the Gauchos connected on 15 3-point shots from the field, tying a program record in the process. In all, the Gauchos shot 15 for 27 from behind the arc, making a sizzling 56% 3-point shot rate. Overall for the game, the Gauchos shot 44% from the field versus the Roadrunners' 40%.†† The Gauchos were once again led by forward/guard Taylor Mole. Mole recorded 20 points, 14 rebounds and 4 assists to go along with her 4 blocks and 2 steals. It was quite a night for the junior transfer from Colorado State. Mole leads the entire Big West Conference in rebounds per game with an average of 10. She is also fourth in the conference for points per game with a whopping average of 15.2, as well as second in blocks per game with an average of 1.8.† UCSB had an astonishing four additional players finish with double digits for points scored in the game. Senior shooting guard Doris Jones had 15, senior point guard Danae Miller had 14, senior guard Megan Anderson had 12 and freshman guard Alyssa Marin finished with 11 points. In their previous match up in December of the 2019-20 season, the Roadrunners were able to overcome a 14-point deficit to defeat the Gauchos, but on Friday night, that was not the case. The Roadrunners clawed their way back to come within 9 points of the Gauchos at the 1:49 mark of the fourth quarter but were unable to mount another comeback in this contest. Prior to Friday's game, the Gauchos were 6-4 against the Roadrunners with only two wins against CSUB at away games. With this win, the Gauchos have broken their Icardo Center losing streak against the Roadrunners.† The two teams were poised to play each other again the next day on Saturday afternoon, but the game was canceled due to the CSUB Roadrunners suspending all women basketball operations as a result of university and department-wide health and safety protocols. The Gauchos have four games remaining in their regular season schedule. The final two home games of the 2020-21 season will be played on Feb. 26 and 27 against the UC Riverside Highlanders. The game on Feb. 27 is also set to coincide with UCSB's Senior Night, in which the team honors all the current seniors for their contributions to the program. The last two games will be played at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo on March 5 and 6.†

sports,"Quicker, Less Physical Style of Play Allows NHL Players To Play Longer",26-Feb-21,1:08 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-26/quicker-less-physical-style-of-play-allows-nhl-players-to-play-longer/,"Due to rule updates and changes in the style of play, hockey has evolved in a way that allows for older players to perform at a level never seen before in the National Hockey League.† Players like Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau are well over a decade into their professional careers and still put up numbers that show the National Hockey League (NHL) front offices that they deserve roster spots.† In recent years, goal-scoring has gone up in the NHL. For the past four seasons, the average goals per game in the NHL has increased and show little signs of slowing down. Many players, specifically goaltenders, attribute this to the fact that the NHL has shrunk goalie equipment in recent years to allow for more scoring opportunities. These goalies have spoken out against these new changes. ""úI'm not happy about it because it's my job,""ù said Winnipeg Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck in a 2018 interview with NBC Sports. ""úAnd really what they want is [for] me to be worse.""ù By giving players more net space to score goals, older players who are worn down by the wear and tear of multiple hockey seasons are now able to create more goal-scoring opportunities that otherwise would not have been there. The pace of play has also contributed a role in the increase of these opportunities. The NHL game is getting faster. Nowadays, most teams have abandoned the philosophy of smashing the opposing team against the boards and have adopted a more spaced-out style of play that creates more shots on goal. Because of this ideology switch, older players are not as susceptible to body damage as they once were. This style of play has also affected one of the most popular aspects of hockey: fighting. As goal-scoring goes up in the NHL, fighting goes down. Players no longer want to spend five minutes in the penalty box when they could be scoring goals and helping out their team instead. No longer having to worry about being punched in the face, older hockey players can focus more on their offensive game while also lengthening their careers.† ""úIt does a lot of damage, let's just leave it at that,""ù said retired Chicago Blackhawks player Daniel Carcillo in a 2019 interview with The Christian Science Monitor about NHL fighting.† With the high risk of physical damage out of the picture, older players can enjoy longer professional careers with less of a chance of suffering broken noses. Instead of playing the unofficial enforcer role, now all players can focus on scoring. With these rule changes and alterations in how players play, hockey athletes can now enjoy professional success well into their late 30s and early 40s. Gordie Howe ""î the famed hockey player who enjoyed a 26-year-long NHL career and had a 100-point season at age 40 ""î was once an anomaly, but recent trends indicate that he may now become the norm.†

sports,Shift in NBA Playstyles Extends Careers of Players,26-Feb-21,1:01 PM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-26/shift-in-nba-playstyles-extends-careers-of-players/," Older generations of basketball players and fans love to talk down on the current game. Watch a single episode of ""úInside the NBA""ù and you'll likely find Shaquille O'Neal complaining about the contemporary NBA. Whether it's drawing complaints about the lack of physicality or the myriad of 3-pointers, today's playstyle has garnered plenty of criticism. However, this playstyle comes with an unintended benefit: the extension of careers in the NBA. Without a doubt, players are able to play for longer and at a higher level than they did in the past. The most obvious example would be LeBron James ""î arguably still the best player in the NBA at the ripe age of 36. But James' size, elite basketball IQ and strength make him more the exception rather than the rule.† Similarly, Chris Paul continues to put up elite numbers at the point guard position, despite both his age (35) and litany of past muscle injuries. While Paul's recent change to a vegan diet seems to have helped immensely, he too has one of the best basketball IQs in the history of the game ""î something that doesn't fade with time. John Stockton and Steve Nash were both able to play elite basketball well into their 30s as well, suggesting that elite point guards can find ways to contribute without relying directly on their athleticism. Instead, I want to focus on role players: players who weren't blessed with the size and strength of James and who aren't one of the top point guards of all time like Paul. For starters, the game's current prioritization on the 3-pointer allows players to contribute long after their athleticism starts to wane. In recent memory, guards such as Vince Carter and Jason Kidd were able to extend their careers by becoming solid 3-point shooters. In addition, players like J.J. Redick and Kyle Korver have continued to serve a role on elite teams due to their spot-up shooting. While these players can sometimes become a liability on defense as they age, their ability to spread the floor and open up the offense is desperately needed in today's game. But this phenomenon extends beyond just guards. Big men are now able to extend their careers by operating as floor spacers and jump shooters even as their post offense and defense play begins to decline. Even at age 36, Marc Gasol continues to play a role on elite teams due to his post passing and ability to hit jump shots. Paul Millsap also just turned 36, but his jump shooting and clever play has allowed him to continue to be an asset to an up-and-coming Nuggets team. In addition to the newfound focus on 3-point shooting, the decreased level of physicality in today's game has also likely extended the careers of these players. First and foremost, these players are taking less contact than in the past, which allows their bodies to have less wear and tear as they get older. In addition, because defenders must allow the offensive player free movement, crafty older players can take advantage of this to create space.† Perhaps the best example of this is with Paul; while Paul may have lost his former elite quickness, his ball handling allows him to create space for his stellar mid-range jumper. In the past, defenders would have been all over Paul, but in today's game, Paul will punish defenders who play him too tight with his rip-through move ""î a move that draws a foul nearly every time. Because of this change in physicality, players are able to use their craftiness to drive to the bucket rather than just relying on athleticism. So, sure, to older generations the game may not be as gritty or as aesthetic, but today's game has allowed players to compete at both an elite and a productive level for longer than ever before.

sports,UCSB Extends Historic Win Streak to 12 Games,26-Feb-21,12:29 PM,['Tiberius Hernandez'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-02-26/ucsb-extends-historic-win-streak-to-12-games/,"Nexus file photo With their back-to-back wins against the Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners this weekend, the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team has made history by breaking the school's all-time win streak with their current 12-0 game run. The Friday game was shaping up to be a quality win, but a late rally by the Roadrunners made for a scrappy last five minutes in which the Gauchos still managed to secure a 71-66 win. On Saturday, however, the Gauchos gained enough momentum to execute a 63-44 rout of the Runners. Going into this week, the Gauchos have a conference record of 10-2 and are currently the prohibited favorites to hold onto the top seed spot for the Big West Conference championship tournament in March. The Gaucho's leading scorer, senior guard JaQuori McLaughlin, also had a historic weekend; on Friday, he became the third Gaucho to ever score a total of 1,000 points while also having 300 assists. Junior forward Miles Norris also had an exceptional weekend, scoring a personal career-high 27 points on 81.8% shooting from the field and 80% from deep in the Saturday rematch against Bakersfield, leading the team to its decisive victory. Friday's game was initially a very even defensive matchup, with both teams letting it fly from midrange and beyond; however, with Santa Barbara outshooting Bakersfield in the first half by 48.3% to 44.4% from the field and 40% to 28.6% from behind the arc, the Gauchos were able to build a 14-point lead in the first half, which would eventually be cut to 10 by halftime. Things got worse for the Runners when their forward Shawn Stith took a hard fall in the paint, sidelining their best paint finisher and impacting the rhythm of their offense. The second half saw Santa Barbara build their largest lead yet of 19, but that soon fell apart when the motivated Runners squad started a comeback push late in the game as the Gauchos got sloppy. Starting with a clutch jumper by substitute Grehlon Easter with 3:33 left in the game, the Runners went on a 7-0 run to make it a two possession game with half a minute left at 63-67. With 13 seconds left, Easter made a crunch-time 3 to make the score 66-69, but an intentional foul on McLaughlin let the veteran Gaucho ice the game by making two free throws with 7 seconds left to hold onto the win. Overall, it was the depth of the Roadrunners that made for a close game, with their bench scoring a staggering 40 points compared to Santa Barbara's 16. Saturday's matchup proved to be much less close, with the Gauchos' offense starting the game on a 7-0 run and holding the lead for the entire game. It was not just a scoring exhibition, however, as Santa Barbara's defense put the clamps on Bakersfield, holding the Roadrunners to single digits until there was 8:32 left in the first half. It was earlier in the first half that Norris started his personal-best scoring rampage by draining a jumper from behind the arc, kicking off an 18-point half for the junior who, by the end of the night, was also the top scorer of the game by a margin of 18. The latter half of Saturday's competition started with a score of 39-21 in Santa Barbara's favor. While Norris continued his offensive crusade, the Gauchos also exhibited their team's shooting abilities, netting 15 points from downtown on 50% shooting. It was with 6:20 left in the game that Josh Pierre-Louis would drain a 3-pointer to acquire the team's largest lead of the game: 24 points. This would also be the last bucket for the Gauchos, but they wouldn't need another as the ""òChos held on for a 63-44 victory. The Gauchos now have a commanding lead in the Big West and will face off against the Highlanders of UC Riverside in an away series this Friday and Saturday. As the Gauchos look to expand their already historic win streak and defend their lead at the top of the Big West standings, this weekend is sure to bring some exhilarating basketball.

While the Gauchos have been making history, Cal Poly has been doing the opposite. Heading into the weekend, Cal Poly is on a seven-game losing streak and is in sole possession of last place in the Big West with a conference record of 1-13. Cal Poly's failures this season can be attributed to their anemic offense. The Mustangs' leading scorer, Alimamy Koroma, is averaging only 12.9 points per game, while the best playmaker on the team, Keith Smith, dishes out 3.6 assists per game. The player with the second-highest assist average is getting only 1.9 helpers every contest.† This season-long scoring drought has caused frustration within the team as the Mustangs have five total ejections on the year. Only two Gauchos have been ejected from games this season. As a team, Cal Poly scores about 61.3 points per game. When comparing these offensive stats to UCSB, the difference is night and day.† Although the Gaucho's only mustered up 52 points in their 16-point defeat to UC Riverside last week, UCSB's team average for points per game still stands at a healthy 76.3 points. Even in the defeat, Big West Player of the Year candidate JaQuori McLaughlin was able to improve his scoring average which now stands at a team-leading 16 points and 5.4 assists per game. The Gauchos will look to keep up their offensive prowess as they take on a vulnerable Mustangs' defense that is giving up an average of 71 points per game. After getting blown out twice by Hawaii three weeks ago, Cal Poly has been scrappy but has not been able to achieve victory. In their next four losses, Cal Poly's largest defeat was by only eight points and is coming off a heartbreaking overtime two-point defeat to the UC Davis Aggies. Cal Poly was not able to score a single point in the overtime period, while UC Davis hit a single bucket to secure the win. UCSB is looking to bounce back after their unprecedented run of 13 straight victories that saw them ascend to the top of the Big West rankings came to an end against UC Riverside. Although the Gauchos squeaked out a win the first time they played the Highlanders, they were not prepared for their game the next day as they were defeated by double digits. Their defeat last Saturday was their first since they were swept by UC Irvine when conference play began back in December. The Gauchos can use this loss as motivation as they begin to prepare for their contests against Cal Poly and the Big West Tournament.† UCSB and Cal Poly's rivalry in men's basketball dates back to 1937, and the two teams have been playing Division I basketball since the 1949-50 season. Since competing as D1 opponents, UCSB has experienced a substantial amount of success against the Mustangs. According to Sports Reference, UCSB has won 75% of their games against Cal Poly while playing D1 basketball with a record that currently stands at 42-14. UCSB also leads in all-time matchups as they have won 82 times while playing 117 games against Cal Poly. UCSB will look to continue their winning ways against Cal Poly as the two teams face off in their weekend doubleheader.†

Angie Banks / Daily Nexus After the UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team saw their record-breaking 13-game win streak come to an end last week against the UC Riverside Highlanders, the Gauchos bounced back as they clinched the Big West Conference's regular season championship with their two double-digit victories against the Cal Poly Mustangs.† With the two wins, the Gauchos end the regular season with a 19-4 overall record and a 13-3 record in conference play. Cal Poly ends the season on a 9-game losing streak while only winning one game against a Big West opponent. Both teams now look to prepare for the Big West Tournament, which begins on March 9.† With this record, the Gauchos have clinched their first Big West Conference's regular season championship since the 2009-10 season and fourth all-time. However, they must go undefeated in the Big West Tournament next week to clinch their first berth in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament since the 2011 season.† In Friday's matchup against Cal Poly, the Gauchos played the game with high defensive intensity, as they forced the Mustangs to 17 turnovers. This pressure on the defensive end of the court helped the Gauchos jump out to a 10-point lead in the first half, as they took 8 more shots than Cal Poly. By guarding the Mustangs at such a high level, UCSB covered up their miscues on the other side of the ball.† After shooting a paltry 25 percent behind the arc in the first half, the Gauchos managed to shoot even worse in the next period, as they missed all four 3-point attempts they made in the second half, thereby ending the game with an 18.8-percent 3-point shooting percentage. Although Cal Poly shot better, their lower volume of shots and their inability to get to the free-throw line allowed for UCSB to acquire a substantial lead.† Although the Gauchos shot poorly, their passing game was much stronger. UCSB ended the game with a 19-11 assist-to-turnover ratio and was led by JaQuori McLaughlin's 15 points and 7 assists.† In their matchup the following day, the Gauchos struggled even more from the field, yet were more successful from beyond the arc. After shooting 47.3 percent from the field in Friday's matchup, the Gauchos regressed to 42.6-percent shooting. However, their [3-point percentage increased by over 13 percentage points, as they shot 33.3percent when taking 3-pointers in Saturday's contest.† In this second matchup between Cal Poly and UCSB, Big West Player of the Year-candidate McLaughlin took a back seat, as he could only score 9 points for his team. McLaughlin finishes his career year with averages of 15.6 points, 5.4 assists, and 3.4 rebounds. Instead of McLaughlin leading the Gauchos to victory on Saturday night, it was forward Amadou Sow who led the way with a season-high 22 points off the bench in UCSB's 16-point victory. Although Sow started most games for the Gauchos this year, his spot in the starting lineup was taken by senior Robinson Idehen, who was playing in his final regular-season game for UCSB. After ending the season on a 2-game win streak, the Gauchos will now be playing in Las Vegas for the Big West Conference Championship. Their first game will be a quarterfinals matchup in the Big West Tournament on March 11. The Gauchos will play the winner of the first-round matchup between No. 8 Cal State University, Northridge and No. 9 Long Beach State. Comments are closed.

sports,Gauchos Clinch NCAA Tournament Bid For First Time Since 2011,14-Mar-21,10:22 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-14/gauchos-clinch-ncaa-tournament-bid-for-first-time-since-2011/," For the first time in ten years, the Gauchos are dancing. On Saturday, the UCSB men's basketball team knocked off the reigning champions UC Irvine 79-63 in the Big West Tournament Championship. With the win, the Gauchos improve to 22-4 on the season and ""î more importantly ""î secure a berth in next week's NCAA Tournament. On paper, Saturday's title matchup was poised to be a clash between two of the best teams in the conference. While Santa Barbara (22-4, 13-3) entered the tournament as the top seed, the Anteaters (18-9, 10-4) knocked off the Gauchos twice during conference play. With both teams allowing a mere 62.8 points per game, the winner-take-all matchup seemed certain to be a back and forth defensive affair. Sure enough, both teams played lockdown defense throughout much of the night. But just as he has all season, Big West Conference Player of the Year JaQuori McLaughlin led the way for the top-seeded Gauchos, dropping 22 points on an efficient 7-13 from the floor. Offense didn't come easy in the first half for the Gauchos ""î who were playing in their first conference championship game since 2012. UCSB jumped out to a quick 10-6 lead in the first half, but stellar defense from Big West Defensive Player of the Year Brad Greene and company largely stifled the ""òChos in the first half. With Greene patrolling the paint, the Gaucho guards were largely forced to settle for contested jumpers. In addition, an ankle injury to Big West Sixth Man of the Year Ajare Sanni early in the first half meant that UCSB had to create offense without their main playmaker off the bench. But despite their offensive struggles, the Gauchos remained locked in on the defensive end. Head Coach Joe Pasternack opted not to double team redshirt junior Collin Welp in the paint, instead trusting the defense of senior forward Miles Norris on the block. In return, Norris held Welp to merely 6 points in the first half of 3-8 shooting. With their leading scorer unable to get into a rhythm, Irvine trailed by one at the half, 31-30. After a quiet first half, UCSB's backcourt took over the game in the second half. An early three by Norris put the ""òChos up 4, and spurred a 16-8 run that gave UCSB a 47-38 lead. From there, McLaughlin and backcourt partner Devearl Ramsey went to work. With the Anteaters shifting to a 2-3 zone in an effort to stifle the run, senior guard Ramsey and McLaughlin utilized their quickness to exploit the holes in the middle of the zone. After a made basket from Ramsey, McLaughlin hit two 3-pointers to give UCSB a convincing 57-44 lead. To their credit, Irvine hung around ""î largely propelled by Welp. Using a wide array of slick moves in the paint, Welp dropped 16 points in the second half. But UCSB's depth and agility was too much for Irvine to handle. With 6:12 left in the second half, McLaughlin hit a deep step-back three to give the Gauchos a 64-48 lead. Minutes later, McLaughlin would utilize his playmaking prowess to set up Norris from deep ""î a shot which gave Santa Barbara a seemingly insurmountable 68-52 lead. With 4:09 left in the second, Norris nailed a dagger 3 that gave the ""òChos a 71-54 lead. In total, Norris contributed 19 points on the night, including three crucial 3-pointers. From there, it was a matter of running out the clock. When the clock struck triple zeroes, the UCSB bench erupted in glee; for the first time in 10 years, the Gauchos were Big West Champions. Santa Barbara will be making its first appearance in March Madness since 2011, when the No. 15 seeded Gauchos fell to No. 2 seeded Florida. Today, the Gauchos will find out who their opponent in the opening round of the NCAA tournament will be. While UCSB will surely be underdogs in their opening matchup, McLaughlin and the Gauchos proved tonight that they have the talent, poise and acumen to potentially make noise in the Big Dance.

sports,Gauchos Take On 5th-Seeded Bluejays in NCAA Tournament Showdown,19-Mar-21,10:26 AM,['Brandon Victor'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-03-19/gauchos-take-on-5th-seeded-bluejays-in-ncaa-tournament-showdown/,"Nexus File Photo On March 13, the UCSB men's basketball team clinched their first NCAA tournament bid in 10 years with their resounding 79-63 victory over UC Irvine. The hard work was done; all the Gauchos had to do on Selection Sunday was find out their seeding and opponent. Within the first few minutes of the selection show, the Gauchos quickly found out both: they would take on the 5th-seeded Creighton Bluejays out of the Big East as the 12th-seed in the West region. Now, the Gauchos (22-4, 13-3) are set on a collision course with Creighton (20-8, 14-6) ""î the runners-up in the highly vaunted Big East conference. In the Big West title game, senior guard JaQuori McLaughlin yet again displayed his talent, poise and decision-making. In the decisive victory, McLaughlin led the Gauchos with 22 points on an efficient 7-13 from the floor ""î including 16 points in the second half. Outside of McLaughlin, junior forward Amadou Sow contributed a 13-point, 11-rebound double-double, while junior forward Miles Norris pitched in 19 points for the upstart ""òChos. ""úWhen we lost to Irvine earlier this year, we told [the team] that this is not a sprint, it's a marathon,""ù Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úWhen the stakes were highest, our guys really competed.""ù On the flip side, the Bluejays enter Saturday's matchup coming off of inarguably their worst performance of the year: a 73-48 trouncing at the hands of Georgetown. Before that loss, however, Creighton had amassed three consecutive wins ""î including an impressive 59-56 victory in the Big East semifinal over University of Connecticut. While 12 vs. 5 upsets have been trendy in recent years, the Gauchos will certainly have their hands-full with an experienced and balanced Creighton squad. Junior guard Marcus Zegarowski leads the Bluejays with 15.5 points per game, but all five starters average at least 10 points per game in what is one of the most prolific offenses in college basketball. For the season, Head Coach Greg McDermott's squad averaged 77 points per game and led the Big East in 3-point percentage (.367) and 3-pointers made per game (9.71). The Bluejays primarily play beyond the perimeter, but junior forward Christian Bishop will present a difficult test for the Gauchos' interior defense. On the season, Bishop averages 10.8 points per game, but does so on an insanely efficient 67% shooting from the floor. Saturday's matchup features one of the best offensive teams in the country facing off against what has been an incredibly stout UCSB defense. The Gauchos rank 19th in scoring defense in the country, giving up merely 62.8 points per game. With the elite perimeter defense of both McLaughlin and graduate guard Brandon Cyrus, the ""òChos seemingly have the tools to handle Creighton's perimeter attack. In the paint, however, the Gauchos looked poised to exploit the relatively small Bluejays team. While the Gauchos rank 35th in the nation with a +5.5 rebounding margin per game, the Bluejays have a negative rebounding margin. Part of this is attributable to Creighton's strong opponents in the Big East, but even in nonconference play, Creighton frequently found itself outrebounded by its opponent. Enter Sow ""î easily Santa Barbara's best option in the interior. On the season, Sow averages 13.7 points per game and 7.6 rebounds per game; in an exploitable matchup, look for UCSB to feed the big man early and often. †If UCSB has any hope of an upset, however, it will need a big game from McLaughlin, who leads the Gauchos in scoring (16.2 points per game) and assists (5.2 assists per game). After winning Big West Conference Player of the Year, McLaughlin was named an Associated Press Honorable Mention All-American earlier this week. ""ú[McLaughlin] has had such a great season,""ù Pasternack said. ""úHis unselfishness is such a huge part of this team and he just makes everyone else better.""ù In UCSB's last NCAA appearance, the 15th-seeded Gauchos were hammered by 2nd-seeded Florida, 79-51. But something feels different about this year's team""îwho seem to be a trendy upset pick in sports media circles. While Creighton easily presents the biggest challenge this season for the ""òChos, Santa Barbara's effort on the defensive end should help keep them in the game. If McLaughlin and Sow can combine on the offensive end, look for UCSB to make some noise come Saturday. UCSB will take on Creighton on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. at Lucas Oil Stadium.

Angie Banks / Daily Nexus Despite a valiant comeback in the second half, the UCSB men's basketball team came up short against Creighton University in the first round of the NCAA tournament, falling 63-62. With the loss, the Gauchos finish the season with a 22-5 record, while Creighton will advance to face Ohio University on March 22. Following a back-and-forth first half, the Bluejays opened the second half of a 13-7 run, extending their lead to 47-37 with 13:32 left in the second half. After hanging around, the 12th-seeded Gauchos were in danger of losing their grip on the game. That's when the shots started to fall. Until that point, Santa Barbara had largely struggled on the offensive end; in the first seven minutes of the second half, the ""òChos shot merely 30% from the floor. Junior forward Miles Norris kickstarted the run for the Gauchos, making all three of his free throws after getting fouled behind the arc. Less than a minute later, senior guard Devearl Ramsey drilled a 3-pointer ""î only the second of the game for UCSB ""î to bring the deficit down to 6. With 10:22 left in the half, Norris followed up an emphatic block on the defensive end with yet another 3-pointer. Suddenly, despite the shooting woes earlier in the half, the Gauchos found themselves only down by 1 point. Ultimately, the Gauchos would extend their lead to 6 ""î their largest lead since early in the first half ""î after senior guard JaQuori McLaughlin drilled a deep 3-pointer for the ""òChos with 5:37 left in the game. While Creighton largely opted to double-team McLaughlin all night, the Big West Player of the Year still finished the contest with 13 points, 7 assists and 6 rebounds. But Creighton ""î the runners-up in the Big East ""î weren't done fighting just yet. A minute and a half later, a 3-pointer by senior guard Mitch Ballock pulled the Bluejays within 1 point. Finally, Creighton regained the lead when junior forward Christian Bishop finished a powerful reverse dunk with 3:10 left in the half, bringing the score to 59-58. A minute and a half later, junior guard Marcus Zegarowski extended the Bluejays' lead to 3 with a smooth jump shot. Zegarowski ""î the Bluejays' leading scorer on the season ""î finished the afternoon with 17 points and 8 assists. Yet again, the upstart Gauchos refused to quit. A strong layup by junior forward Amadou Sow chipped the lead down to 1. After Creighton fouled Sow on the next trip down, the junior calmly stepped up to the free-throw line and drilled both of his free throws to give UCSB a 1-point lead. With 37 seconds left, the Gauchos were exactly where they wanted to be ""î up by 1 point and on the verge of pulling off a massive upset. All they had to do was get a few stops and UCSB would advance in the NCAA tournament. While the Gauchos forced the Bluejays into a miss, Bishop grabbed a massive offensive rebound; after a reach-in foul by Sow, Bishop stepped to the line with the chance to give Creighton the lead yet again. Sure enough, despite shooting only 57% from the charity stripe for the season, Bishop drilled both free throws. Instead of calling a timeout, UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack opted to let McLaughlin push the ball up the court. Yet again, Creighton double-teamed McLaughlin, who pivoted and found an open Sow in the paint. After absorbing contact from the defender, Sow narrowly missed a 5-foot shot near the hoop. Sophomore guard Shereef Mitchell missed the front-end of the one-and-one for the Bluejays with 1.9 seconds left, forcing graduate guard Brandon Cyrus to heave up a prayer from behind the half court ""î a shot that missed badly. Despite an incredibly valiant effort, the Gauchos came up just short in their first tournament appearance in 10 years. It's a very difficult time for all of them, and our whole staff, because this game was right there for us,""ù Pasternack said. ""úThis game can't define our season. Our players did such an amazing job, off the court with COVID and on the court, competing for championships.""ù†

Let's take a look at how the team is doing a little past the halfway point of the season.† With much to play for as the season goes on, the Gauchos are in the midst of a battle for the top spot in the Big West with UC rival, UC Irvine. Although the Gauchos boast a better win percentage at 70% as opposed to UCI's 65.5% in conference play, the Gauchos are a game back of the Anteaters.† How did the Gauchos get here one might ask? The Gauchos have been producing on both sides of the ball the whole season.† Nationally, the Gauchos rank inside the top 50 of NCAA division 1 baseball in batting average, slugging, earned run average, WHIP and just about every other major pitching statistic.† This dominance on both sides of the ball led to a blazing start by the Gauchos, coming out of the gate 6-1 going on a six-game win streak following an opening day loss. The momentum was put to a halt, taking a sweep to the 15th ranked Oregon Ducks. The Gauchos didn't let that hinder their momentum, going on to sweep the University of San Francisco before the start of league play.† Opening up league play in the middle of March, the Cal State Fullerton Titans played host to the Gauchos. The bats came out hot in the first two games with the Gauchos taking the first two games by a combined run differential of 20-6. Unfortunately, they ended up splitting the series losing the latter two in heartbreaking fashion.† The second series of the league came with a four-game sweep of UC Davis. The starting pitching in this series showed why they are one of the best staffs in the country giving up only six runs over the four-game stretch.† The first series of April took place against the out-of-state University of Hawaii. The Gauchos ended up taking three of four from Hawaii with outstanding pitching performances throughout the series. The standout performance came from game one starting pitcher, sophomore Michael McGreevy, who tossed a three-hit complete game shutout, setting the tone for the rest of the series.† The last series played by the Gauchos was against a struggling Cal State Northridge team who had not taken a league series so far this year. The Gauchos opened up the series with a thrilling walk-off home victory thanks to Gianni Bloom beating out an infield single and Steele Ledford beating out the throw home. UCSB followed the thriller with two masterful hitting and pitching displays, scoring 11 runs in both of the next two games while only conceding 4 runs. The Gauchos did drop the last game of the series, but nonetheless still took their third straight league series.† Players to watch out for ""¶ Starting Pitching: † Relief Pitching:† † Fielding:† † Batting: This sums up the mid-season breakdown for the UC Santa Barbara Gaucho baseball team.

These matches were held last Wednesday and Thursday in San Diego and the Gauchos will look to complete the series sweep at the Thunderdome this Saturday to finish off the regular season.† This away sweep by the Gauchos shows both teams' direction as the two programs look to prepare for the Big West Tournament. The Gauchos, the No. 18 team in the country, improved to 12-4 with the two victories, while the Tritons have lost their fourth straight and stands at 3-11.† The first game between the two Big West foes was a heavily contested match that saw the Gauchos come out on top 3-2. After the first three sets, UCSB found themselves down 1-2, however, the Gauchos were able to take momentum back from the Tritons and steal the victory by winning the final two sets. UCSD's senior outside hitter Kyle McCauley was the game leader in kills with 18, however it was not enough to lead his team to victory. UCSB senior opposite Randy DeWeese was right behind McCauley with 17 kills of his own.† In the first three sets, the Tritons were firing on all cylinders as their defense and offense overpowered everything the Gauchos threw at them. In the first set, the Tritons had a team high 43.8% hitting percentage and held the Gauchos to just 15.4% hitting percentage two sets later. With no margin for error, the Gauchos were able to claw out a win in the fourth set. After this victory, UCSB never let up as they controlled the final set from start to finish. The Gauchos had a dominant 83.3% hitting percentage which was more than enough to seal the victory. The second match between the two programs was as competitive with each set being decided by two points. However, each set was a UCSB triumph. The Gauchos swept the Tritons 3-0 behind DeWeese's 13 kills and senior setter Casey McGarry's 37 assists. This victory marked UCSB's seventh sweep of the year. The hitting percentage for both teams was very low when compared to their previous match as the Gauchos had a 27.3% hitting percentage, while the Tritons hit a lowly 16.8%.

With the victory, the Gauchos clinched the second seed as well as a first-round bye in the Big West Tournament that will be held in Honolulu next week. The Gaucho's sweep over the Tritons was their second in as many games and completed the season sweep for UCSB. This UCSB victory marked the eighth time that the Gauchos have beaten an opponent in three straight sets. The Gauchos are now on a hot streak entering postseason play as they have won eight in a row and finished the regular season with a record of 13-4. The Tritons, who also have a spot in the Big West Tournament, are heading in the opposite direction as they have lost five straight as they head into their first-round matchup.† The first set between the two programs was the most competitive of the night as it was decided by only 2 points. The beginning of the game was extremely close as neither team could muster anything other than 3 and 4-point runs. However, the Gauchos were finally able to create some breathing room as they went on a 9-4 run to make the score 18-12. UCSD then stormed back with a 10-4 run to cut the Gaucho lead down to 1. The Gauchos were able to get the game point with a clutch double block that secured the victory with a 25-23 game win.† The final two sets of the night were not as fierce as the first as UCSB took control of the match. In the second set, the Gauchos never trailed and were able to go up 2-0 with a 25-16 win. In the final game of the match, the two teams kept it close in the beginning as they traded points. After leading 13-11, the Gauchos went on a 5-0 run that created distance between the two teams that the Tritons never recovered from. With this run, UCSB was able to end the night with a 25-18 victory and complete the series, season and game sweep.† UCSB was led by senior Henry Hancock, who was making his final regular season appearance for the Gauchos, as he finished the match with a career-high 11 kills which tied the game-high. Right behind him was sophomore Ryan Wilcox who had 10 kills of his own to go alongside his 9 digs. The Gauchos were able to hold the Tritons to a lowly 19% hitting percentage in the match, mostly from their dominant final two sets. In addition to the Gaucho's strong defensive night, UCSB also played well on offense. UCSB's hitting percentage stood at a solid 39.7% while the team only committed 6 attacking errors. The Gauchos will look to continue their great all-around play into the postseason.† With the regular season over, both teams have their eyes set on the Big West Tournament. UCSD will play as the No. 4 seed and take on the California State University Northridge Matadors, while the Gauchos will enjoy their first-round bye. UCSB will take the court again in the second round against the winner of No. 3 seed Long Beach State Beach and No. 6 seed UC Irvine.

sports,Gauchos Win Blue-Green Rivalry Game in Energetic Late Comeback,20-Apr-21,10:05 PM,['Jacob Davis'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-04-20/gauchos-win-blue-green-rivalry-game-in-energetic-late-comeback/,"Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus UC Santa Barbara continued their seven-game spring exhibition with a home game against the Cal Poly Mustangs for another iteration of the Blue-Green rivalry. The Gauchos came out on top with two late goals for a 2-1 win that brought a spark of life to what started out as a slow contest. The Gauchos started their first home game since the 2019 season off strong with multiple shots from senior forward Ameyawu Muntari and junior midfielder Thaabit Baartman within the first 10 minutes of play. The Gauchos dominated possession and kept most of the play on the Cal Poly side in the first half, aside from a number of counters from the Mustangs. The first shot on goal for the Gauchos came from right-back Rigoberto Barragan with a bent, left-foot shot outside the 18-yard box met relatively comfortably with a diving save from the Cal Poly keeper. The Mustang counterattacks proved effective when a lobbed ball into the 18 toward a Cal Poly attacker demanded that senior goalkeeper Alan Carrillo come off his line. He met the ball with a punch that simultaneously hit the Cal Poly player in the back of the head. The Mustangs were awarded a penalty that was converted into the bottom-left corner just past the arms of Carrillo in the 25th minute. Despite holding most of the possession in the first half, the Gauchos had noticeable trouble converting any opportunities in the final third. Midfield presence, however, was strong with Lucas Gonzalez, who was back for his first game off an ankle injury, and 2019 Freshman of the Year Finn Ballard McBride, who demonstrated great field control and distribution. The Gaucho defensive line also proved strong, with awesome displays of speed and strength from Carson Vom Steeg, Sam Fletcher and Henry Davies against the explosive Mustang counters. Upon the start of the second half, the Gauchos lost some of their possession control, which led to some scrambling. Following some back-and-forth with possession, the Gauchos found their equalizer in the 82nd minute with a stunning 30-yard shot into the upper-left corner of the net from Muntari.† The goal gave the team an apparent surge in morale that resulted in a consistent onslaught against the Mustang defense.† McBride just missed a golden opportunity for a game winner with a shot just outside the 6 that hit the left post. What McBride missed before, he later converted with a penalty off a handball from the Cal Poly defense. Reminiscent of the Mustangs' penalty, McBride slotted the ball into the bottom-left corner past the outstretched hands of the keeper in the 87th minute. The Mustangs had one final opportunity to equalize two minutes later with a free kick just outside the 18, but barely missed by hitting the top post. The match was very physical overall, with a large number of fouls from each side and a few yellows, but the Gauchos demonstrated strength in the defensive and midfield sectors. A more cohesive attack is likely on the to-do list of improvements for the team, but with the shooting capabilities from the likes of Muntari, the Gauchos look to be in a decent position. The Gauchos will travel to Cal State Bakersfield on Sunday, April 25 for another exhibition match at 6 p.m., where they will look to maintain an unbeaten record.

This was followed up by a tremendous outing from Michael McGreevy, going 6 of the 7 innings and giving up 2 runs in the six innings. All in all, the Gauchos put it all together in game one, putting up 15 runs, only giving up 2 to the Tritons and committing no errors en route to a 15-2 victory.† † Game Two Breakdown: Victory! The bats stayed awake for game one of the doubleheader. The Gauchos put up multiple solid innings of 3 runs in the second, sixth and seventh innings, as well as a 4 spot in the fourth inning.

Although a rough outing, the positive is that the pen came away with 5 strikeouts in the 3 innings of work.† † What's on the line?

Despite the rough start to the season, the Dirtbags have been 7-3 in their previous 10 games.† † Series Implications: † First place in the conference""¶ With a series win or sweep the Gauchos could come closer to taking over first in the Big West. Unfortunately, they will have to wait a week due to Irvine having a non-conference series this weekend, so even with a sweep of Long Beach, the Gauchos will be behind in conference winning percentage.† † Time to get the show on the road""¶ The Long Beach Dirtbags come into the series with significantly less games played on their schedule than the Gauchos. So, this series proves as a make-it-or-break-it series for them, as they can stay at 500 with a series draw, go above with a series win or go below with a series loss.† † Players to watch: UCSB † 2021 Brooks Wallace Award Watch List""¶ The most talented shortstops in the country get named to this award list every year, and this year a fellow Gaucho has been added to the list.

The cleanup hitter""¶ Clearing the bases when his teammates get on base is in the cleanup hitter's job description, and let me tell you, Zach Rodriguez has put on a show. He has knocked in a team-high 33 runs, while amassing a .667 slugging percentage in league ""î which also leads the team.† Sub-3.00 Earned Run Average""¶ The presumed ace of the team, Michael McGreevy is sitting at a 2.70 earned run average on the season. While his strikeout per nine doesn't jump off the page, his strikeout-to-walk ratio is an amazing 37:2 in league play. Not to mention he boasts an impressive 3-0 record as a starting pitcher in conference play.† † Players to watch: Long Beach † On-base machine""¶ Connor Kokx has been proven to be a terror on the basepaths. Aside from trying to keep him off the base paths since he has a .474 on base percentage in league, he has stolen 7-8 bases which would put him at just under a stolen base every other conference game.† The numbers don't lie""¶ Starter/reliever Johnathan Lavallee has pitched 18.2 innings this year and given up just one earned run. An even more impressive stat is Lavallee has held opponents to a .097 batting average in league play.† Hello old friends""¶ From facing Alfredo Ruiz in high school to writing about him ""î despite having a shaky start to the 2021 campaign, don't count out Ruiz who posted an impressive 1.80 earned run average in 2020.

This will be the program's first appearance in the NCAA Tournament since 2011 and marks one of the greatest seasons of in-conference play in UCSB history. After a successful regular season that saw the Gauchos finish 13-4, UCSB breezed by their first tournament opponent, Long Beach State, who had to defeat UC Irvine to move onto the semifinals. However, the championship game was not as easy as the semifinals as UCSD kept it close until the deciding point.†† During the Gauchos' semifinal match on Friday, Long Beach State, the two-time defending national champions, jumped out to a 1-0 lead with a lopsided score of 25-16. UCSB quickly shook off the rust caused by their first-round bye and won the next three sets in a deciding fashion as they outscored Long Beach State by 25 points in the final three frames. ""úYou know typically when you get beat like that in the first game, you don't always come back from that the way we did,""ù UCSB Head Coach Rick McLaughlin said in his postgame press conference. ""úAnd that's a tribute to these guys. They didn't flinch. They didn't feel anything after that first game, and I knew they were locked in.""ù† The man of the match for the Gauchos' semifinal game was sophomore Ryan Wilcox, as he led the team with 16 kills and 3 service aces. Freshman Ryan Pecsok led the Gauchos with 17 digs, while freshman Donovan Todorov had a game-high 6 blocks. For Long Beach State, redshirt sophomore Spencer Olivier had a game-high 18 kills, while junior Simon Andersen had 5 blocks and freshman Mason Briggs had 14 digs. With the semifinal defeat, Long Beach State's title defense comes to an end, finishing the season with a 7-5 record.† The championship match was a highly contested game in which the largest set victory was only by 5 points. To play in the championship match, UCSD needed to upset the No. 1 team in the nation, University of Hawai'i. Similar to UCSB's match against Long Beach State, the Tritons won the first set and acquired a 1-0 lead. In the second set, the Tritons started out hot as they built an 18-13 lead. However, the Gauchos refused to go down 2-0 as they went on a 9-3 run to win the set 27-25 and tie the match at a game apiece. In the third match, the Gauchos took advantage of UCSD's sloppy play as the Tritons had seven service errors, which caused them to lose the set 25-21. An 8-3 run at the end of the final set secured the victory for UCSB and clinched their first Big West Championship in program history.† ""úWe play UCSD tough every time we see them, but it's always tight,""ù said McLaughlin. ""úThey are a great team and we knew we were in for another battle. Sure enough they took the first game from us but our seniors led the way and didn't get rattled. Beating a team six straight times is not an easy thing to do.""ù Senior Randy DeWeese led the Gauchos in the championship with 13 kills and 2 service aces. Wilcox, who was named the Big West Championship Most Valuable Player, played just as well with 12 kills of his own in addition to his 9 digs and 4 blocks. Both upperclassmen will look to continue their solid play as they continue their season in the NCAA Tournament. The Gauchos will take on the Pepperdine Waves in the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament. The match will be played on May 4 and will be held in Columbus, Ohio.

Vogt continued to make an impact, as he would steal home in the top of the fourth to make it a 3-0 Gaucho lead. The momentum was put to a halt, however, as the Dirtbags responded with a 1-run fourth inning and a 3-run fifth inning. That would prove to be the decisive inning, as the Dirtbags held on for a 4-3 victory.† † Game Two Breakdown: Victory This game had the making of a pitcher's duel, as each of the starting pitchers went six scoreless frames. That's when the floodgates opened, as the Gauchos managed to bring across 4 runs in the seventh inning. This forced the end of the night for the Dirtbags starter, Luis Ramirez.

Across those innings, Benbrook struck out 4 while only allowing 1 baserunner.† Leadoff hitter or power hitter""¶? Shortstop Jordan Sprinkle had a day at the plate! Of the Gauchos' 6 runs, 5 of them were driven in by Sprinkle, who had a double and a homer in game two of the series.† † What's on the line?

This series is huge, as they will want to rack up conference wins before they play conference leaders UC Irvine the following weekend. Before the previous series, the Gauchos had won 4 straight conference series and will look to start a new streak this weekend.† Turn the tables""¶ The Mustangs come into the series in a bit of an unfortunate run of games. They face the Gauchos on a 2-game losing streak, winning just 4 of their last 10 games. Although the Mustangs have been sliding as of late, they will look to turn it around with 20 more conference games to play for.† † Series Implications: † First Place Is Within Striking Distance""¶ With a series sweep the Gauchos could possibly overtake first place, assuming they get a little help with some UC Irvine losses. Nonetheless, this game will build momentum for their next series versus UC Irvine.†† Time To Turn it Around""¶ Being two games under .500 in conference play, the Mustangs could use this series as momentum, with much of the season to play. With a sweep of the Gauchos, the Mustangs could jump to 2 games above .500 in league play and jump to fifth place in the conference.† † Players To Watch: UCSB † The Walk-Off Winner""¶ Christian Kirtley showed up big in game four against Long Beach State (LBSU). To the tune of 2 homeruns, reaching base safely 4 of 5 plate appearances, including a three-run go ahead homer to win the game.

In 56 innings, he has only given up 1 home run and 12 doubles. The Standout""¶ With most of the Mustang's hitters hovering around a .350 ""ì .400 slugging percentage, one player stands out in the pack. Brooks Lee is slugging an amazing .664 on the season. Bullpen Struggles""¶ Look for the bullpen to factor into this series in order to make a significant run for the Mustangs.

Key Man""¶ For the Gauchos to win, they'll need success from their clean-up hitter. In their 2 losses versus LBSU, Zachary Jacob Rodriguez only managed 1 hit. Look for that to change come this series. Unsung Hero""¶ In the last series, Hall was thrown into the fire with only two prior conference appearances. He came out sharp and had a huge contribution to the victory.

sports,Gauchos Hold Off Late Matador Resurgence in Home Win,5-May-21,3:41 PM,['Jacob Davis'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-05-05/gauchos-hold-off-late-matador-resurgence-in-home-win/," After last week's loss to the 2020 West Coast Conference Champions Loyola Marymount University Lions, the Gauchos looked to regroup at home against a more familiar opponent. The Gauchos initially displayed great technical skill and teamwork against the Cal State Northridge Matadors, but they lost momentum and played with their backs against the wall in the second half, holding out to a 2-1 win. The Gauchos came out in the first half in good form, stringing together effective passes on quick breaks to dismantle the Matador defense. The quick breaks proved effective early on, as a quick build up in the seventh minute resulted in a finessed, left-footed shot into the top-right corner from 14 yards out by Lucas Gonzalez. Gonzalez proved to be a key player in Sunday's game, showing speed and aggression as he looked to create opportunities for the Gaucho's attacks. The Gaucho midfield dictated much of the pace and possession of the first half. The midfielders worked as a cohesive group to string together passes and create opportunity after opportunity for the offense. There was a stark sense of discipline and purpose in their first-half play that juxtaposed CSUN's frenetic long balls. One stand-out player was Sam Fletcher, who essentially controlled the game. Fletcher acted as a bridge between the back line and attacking mids, demonstrating precise passing, smart creations of space and ruthless aggression in taking back possession. He looked to be a real leader out on the pitch Sunday night. The Gauchos' back four ""î Rigoberto Barragan, Carson Vom Steeg, Henry Davies and Salaudeen Ayinla ""î looked to be impenetrable in the first half. They played with a coolness that reflected a disciplined and experienced unit. Most of the attacks in the game started out of the back, where they connected passes until the midfield created space. From there, the Gauchos created blistering attacks that netted the Gauchos a brace in the 24th minute. Crisp passing in the midfield from Gonzalez allowed Finn Ballard McBride to slot in a through ball for Ramses Martinez, who used a beautiful first touch to set himself up for a strong shot to the near post. However, the momentum entirely switched in the second half. The Gauchos came out lacking the urgency and purpose that characterized their phenomenal first half, while CSUN seemingly became tactical chameleons, adopting the Gauchos' methodical build up into a quick attack. Possession also switched in favor of the Matadors as they began to play out of the back and play through the midfield for the majority of the second half. The Gauchos resorted to long balls, as they became tired and lost their energy.† Eventually, the Gaucho defense was picked apart and outnumbered when the midfield was slow to respond defensively, resulting in the Matadors' consolation goal. Though the Matadors never scored again, the Gauchos played with their backs to the wall and narrowly avoided an equalizer on a few occasions. When the Gauchos had the energy, they played with great skill and purpose, but when their energy depleted, they lost their identity. The team will look to regain their endurance next Saturday, May 8, against UC Davis at home at 6 p.m.

On the other hand, they are coming off of a shaky series versus a middle-of-the-pack Long Beach State, with their last loss coming via shutout. Before the LBSU series, they had three straight series wins, so one has to ask, is this the Gauchos""ò opportunity to take the conference lead? † Series Implications: † The top spot in the conference""¶ The next closest team to the second place Gauchos is CSU Bakersfield at a 0.591 winning percentage in the conference. So, with the Gauchos and Anteaters being separated by a 0.036 winning percentage, it's obvious that this is a crucial series. Also, with only two conference series left for the Gauchos following this series versus UC Irvine, so there is no room for error. † Players To Watch: UCSB † Bounce back start""¶ Coming off a shaky performance and picking up only his second loss of the year, look for sophomore starter Rodney Boone to turn things around. He still holds an impressive 2.47 ERA and an 11.47 K/9 ratio on the season.† Stay hot""¶ From being the walk-off hero against LBSU, sophomore utility player Christian Kirtley continued his hot stretch, driving in 1 run in Game 4 against Cal Poly. He's brought up his conference on base percentage to .364 while having the fourth most runs batted in on the team.† Dominate on the bump""¶ Freshman left-handed pitcher Carter Benbrook picked up a save in Game 1 against Cal Poly and returned in the series to pitch four scoreless innings and pick up a win. He has lowered his ERA on the season to 2.27, and opponents are hitting just .201 off of him this season.† † Players To Watch: UCI † A sub what ERA""¶? Freshman pitcher reliever Jacob King comes into the series with a 2.6 ERA, with the ERA being 0.60 in 11 relief appearances.† Another reliever that's hot""¶ Junior pitcher reliever Michael Stanford also has the hot hand out of the pen with a 1.64 ERA with a 1.73 WHIP in five relief appearances.† Good luck containing these guys""¶ Junior catcher Dillon Tatum, redshirt sophomore infielder Jake Cosgrove, redshirt freshman outfielder Nathan Church and junior catcher Jacob Castro each boast an On-base Plus Slugging at above 1.000. Of the bunch, Tatum provides the power, with 11 of the teams' 26 homers and a .733 slugging percentage, which is .200 better than any other teammate.† † Where to watch the Games""¶ † Game 1: Friday, May 7 at 5 p.m. Game 2: Saturday, May 8 at 3 p.m. Game 3: Saturday, May 8 at 7 p.m. Game 4: Sunday, May 9 at 1 p.m. † All games will be at our home stadium, Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.†

They continued their poor hitting into this game, managing a less-than-impressive 2 hits on the day. Starter Cory Lewis tossed a solid game for the Gauchos, going 6.1 innings, giving up 3 earned runs and picking up 11 strikeouts. Reliever Jorge Arellano Jr. got roughed up in the seventh inning, giving up 2 earned runs, putting the Gauchos down 6-0. There were no relief appearances for the Anteaters as their starter, Michael Frias, went the distance to the tune of 10 strikeouts across 9 shutout innings.† † Game Four Breakdown: Loss This game featured the third straight game of no run support for the Gauchos pitchers. However, a lot of run support was needed in this game as the Gauchos pitching got roughed up as JD Callahan gave up 4 earned in just over 2 innings and Conner Roberts gave up 3 earned in just over 3 innings. Conner Dand provided stability in the latter innings, going 3.1 scoreless innings. On the offensive side, they knocked the Anteaters' starter out of the game in the third inning, and the Anteaters' bullpen was lights out the rest of the game, giving up 0 runs. So, the Gauchos dropped the series in game 4 to the tune of a 7-2 loss. † Game Three by the Numbers: † Near perfection""¶ Starter Michael Frias shut down the Gauchos on Saturday evening, going the distance in the ballgame, while only allowing 5 baserunners and striking out double the amount he let on base.† Hard hitter""¶ Centerfielder Mike Peabody provided the runs for the Anteaters, driving in 4 of the 6 runs, and going the yard on the day. Where is the top of the lineup""¶? The Gauchos first 4 hitters went a combined 1-15 with 1 walk against Frias.† † Game Four by the Numbers:† † Can't do it by himself""¶ Zach Rodriguez had almost half of the Gauchos hits, having 3 of the 8 hits for the Gauchos.† Unhittable""¶ The Anteaters bullpen went 5.1 innings, allowing just 4 hits and 0 runs.† Combined effort""¶ The Anteaters stole a page out of the Gauchos book by having a combined effort for the victory. They had four different players have at least one RBI and six different players score at least one run. † What's next for the Gauchos? After a disappointing season series loss versus UC Irvine, the Gauchos fall a couple of games behind the Anteaters, but retain second place in the conference. The Gauchos will go on to face the UCLA Bruins in a three-game non-conference series, taking place from May 14 to May 16. Stay tuned for the preview!

Starting in the first inning, the Anteaters jumped on starting pitcher Michael McGreevy. The scoring came via a double and a sacrifice fly, putting UC Irvine up 3-0 after the top of the first. In the bottom of the first the Gauchos responded with a catcher miscue leading to a run, and a Zach Rodriguez RBI single. Going into the top of the third inning, the Gauchos ran into more trouble with the Anteaters getting 2 more runs off an RBI double. Once again, going into the bottom of the third, the Gauchos trailed by 3, but responded with a 2 spot in the third inning and a run in the fourth inning, tying the game up 5-5. Cole Cummings scored the last run of the ballgame with a solo shot in the bottom of the sixth inning. From that point on, the Gauchos' pitching held down the lead, going on to win 6-5.† Game Two Breakdown: Loss This game got off to the good start for the Gauchos as starter Rodney Boone was dealing through 7 innings. The first run of the ballgame came for the Gauchos in the bottom of the fourth inning, with McClain O'Connor doubling down the left field line, and Jason Willow scoring. The pitching on each side was lights out for a majority of the game. In the eighth inning, trouble struck for the Gauchos as the Anteaters put up a 5 spot, and forced the Gauchos' starting pitcher Boone out of the ballgame. The Anteaters shut the door on the Gauchos in the bottom of the eighth and ninth innings, leading to a comfortable 5-1 victory over the Gauchos.† Game One by the Numbers: Short of a triple""¶ Third baseman Cole Cummings was a triple away from cycle hitting, along with three runs scored and an RBI on the night.† Not your typical start""¶ The sure-handed right-hander Michael McGreevy got roughed up on the night by the Anteaters, allowing 5 runs and† 3 earned across just 4.1 innings pitched.† Not the best fielding day""¶ For the top two teams in the conference, this wasn't the best fielding day for either team, with the Gauchos committing 2 errors, while the Anteaters committed a whopping 4 errors.† Game Two by the Numbers: Hitting Woes""¶ The Gauchos really had a tough time hitting the ball in game two, managing only 8 hits, striking out 12 times, and leaving 8 runners on base.† McClain O'Connor""¶ In just his fourth conference game of the season, McClain O'Connor had an excellent game, going 2-2 with a pair of doubles and an RBI.† Talk about a tough loss""¶ Starter Rodney Boone didn't get much run support on the day, which led to his third loss of the season, even though he went 7 shutout innings before giving up 2 runs in the eighth inning.† What's on the line? The teams split the first two games of the series, so once again, these teams will battle through† these next two games to figure out if the Gauchos will overtake the Anteaters, the Anteaters will stay atop the conference, or if they will extend their lead on the Gauchos.†

sports,Gauchos Win First-Ever Big West Championship Title in Successful Season,20-May-21,6:36 AM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-05-20/gauchos-win-first-ever-big-west-championship-title-in-successful-season/," Even with a disappointing 3-0 defeat to Hawai'i in the NCAA Tournament semifinals that saw their incredible run come to an end, the UC Santa Barbara men's volleyball team had a year to remember, as they had one of the most successful seasons in program history as winners of the Big West Championship for the first time in school history.† The Gauchos finished the regular season holding the No. 2 seed in the Big West rankings with a 13-4 record, while only losing three conference games the entire season. UCSB continued their success into the postseason, defeating Long Beach State and UC San Diego en route to the Big West Championship. The Gauchos had one more victory in the tank as they defeated Pepperdine 3-1 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament before falling to their conference rival and eventual NCAA champion Hawai'i. † Throughout the year, UCSB was led by senior Randy DeWeese. With his average of 4.04 kills per set and .73 blocks per match in the season, DeWeese was awarded a spot on the Big West All-Conference First Team alongside UCSB teammates Roy McFarland, Casey McGarry and Keenan Sanders. UCSB and Hawai'i were the only programs with four players named to the All-Conference First Team. Junior Ryan Wilcox was named as an honorable mention. The Gaucho's star-studded lineup had a big impact on the team and contributed to their success throughout the season.† The Gauchos began their unforgettable season undefeated as they started out 4-0 with two wins against UC San Diego and UC Irvine each. UCSB played strong in all four victories, as they only lost two sets over the course of their winning streak. However, UCSB's solid play came to a stunning halt as they went on a three-game losing streak to bring their record down to a modest 4-3. All three defeats were against the team that would eventually end their season for good, Hawai'i.† In these three defeats, the Gauchos were only able to win one set, as they were swept 3-0 in two of their matches. Although Hawai'i showed why they were the best team in the country, UCSB kept the games closer than the final score suggests. In all three matches, most of the sets were decided by five points or less. In fact, the biggest win was a nine-point victory for UCSB in the first set of the three-game series. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, this was not a trend as they lost every set after that. After the series, UCSB was able to put these defeats behind them to go on another winning streak.† After splitting a two-game series with Long Beach State, the Gauchos closed out the regular season with eight straight wins, all against Big West opponents. Out of† eight matches, only one went the five-set distance. During the winning streak, UCSB swept a two-game series against Cal State Northridge and 2 three-game series against UCSD and UCI. With the Big West Tournament around the corner, UCSB was playing their best ball.† In the first round of the conference tournament, the Gauchos defeated Long Beach State handily by a score of 3-1. The championship game was a surprise matchup, as they went up against UCSD. The Tritons had just secured a major upset by beating Hawai'i, the top team in the country, the night before. Playing against a more inferior opponent than expected, the Gauchos were able to win the Big West Championship by defeating UCSD 3-1. UCSB was able to clinch a berth in the NCAA Tournament with the victory.† In their final victory of the season, the Gauchos were able to defeat the only non-conference opponent they faced in Pepperdine. The match was very close, as each set was decided by three points or less. However, the Gauchos were able to leave the court victorious, as they won the final set. In their final game, Hawai'i swept UCSB, and the Gauchos were sent home. Although UCSB ended the season with disappointment, the 2021 season was one that will not be forgotten, and it is a leap forward that the program can build upon in the future.†

Coming off of two difficult opponents ""î UC Los Angeles, who was ranked inside the top 25 nationally, and UC Irvine, who was atop of the Big West, Riverside will be a change of pace. The Gauchos have faced some stout pitching in their previous five losses, so look for the bats to wake up in the upcoming series. † Playing spoiler for the Gauchos""¶ UC Riverside has had a disappointing season thus far, holding a record of 12-24 in conference play and 2-5 outside of the conference. Currently on a 9-game losing streak, their disappointing record will offer them some momentum going into the tail end of their season. Also, with the Gauchos still within striking distance of the conference lead, the Highlanders have a real shot at ending the Gauchos' quest to become the Big West Conference champions.† † Series Implications: † Closing the gap at the top of the conference""¶ With the Gauchos losing their previous series to UC Irvine, they will need help from Cal State Bakersfield in their own series against Irvine. If the Gauchos do get help from Bakersfield, and do their own part by sweeping the Highlanders, they will have a real shot at the conference title in the last weekend of conference play. On the other hand, the Highlanders have dug themselves a big hole with their .333 winning percentage. Their best-case scenario is upsetting the Gauchos in the series to move up to seventh in the conference.† † Players to watch from UCSB: † Michael McGreevy""¶ Starting pitcher Michael McGreevy has had quite the season and is looking to carry momentum from the UCLA game, in which he picked up his seventh win against a nationally ranked team while giving up just one run and striking out 12 batters.† † Zach Rodriguez""¶ Rodriguez's hitting stats in conference are simply amazing. He leads the team in runs batted in by a clear margin, with 34 RBIs, and has a .541 slugging in conference play. † Carter Benbrook""¶ Benbrook has been the go-to guy out of the bullpen, whether that be in long relief or for a save. In 30 innings pitched, he posts a 2.10 ERA while having a 12.00 K/9 ratio. † Players to watch from UCR † Dylan Orick""¶ Number 35 has put on quite the hitting clinic for UCR this season. Over 42 games, he boasts a .469 slugging percentage and 76 total bases to lead the team, and he is second in RBIs with 27 on the season. † Travis Bohall""¶ UCR doesn't have many stolen bases on the season, but Bohall has been a menace on the basepaths, swiping 15 of the team's 26 total stolen bases.† † Pitching staff""¶ As a whole, the UCR staff have had a rough year. Boasting a team ERA of 7.18 and having an opponent batting average of .322, they will need to step up to upset UCSB.† † When and where to watch the games""¶ † Game 1: Friday, May 21, at 6 p.m. † Game 2: Saturday, May 22, at 12 p.m. † Game 3: Saturday, May 22, at 3 p.m. † Game 4: Sunday, May 23, at 1 p.m. † All games will be away at the Riverside Sports Complex.

That was enough for the Gauchos to earn an at-large bid by the NCAA selection committee. Based on their at-large bid, they were placed as the third seed in the Tucson Regional. Rounding out the Tucson Regional was No. 1 seed University of Arizona, No. 2 seed Oklahoma State University and No. 4 seed Grand Canyon University. In order for the Gauchos to advance, they would have had to beat their first opponent Oklahoma State, which would have allowed them to be in a three-game series with the remaining three teams since it was double elimination.† † Game One: UCSB beats Oklahoma State with a flurry of runs † The Gauchos' first game of the tournament started with an unsung hero having a career day. Having only played in 10 conference games, Marcos Castanon picked the right day to have 5 hits and come a triple short of the cycle. The Gauchos overall had an excellent day at the plate, putting 21 runners on base and 3 via walks, while pooling together 18 hits. Starter Rodney Boone also put together the type of performance you'd expect from him, going 7.1 innings and striking out 11 while giving up a mere 3 earned runs. The Gauchos went on to win the opening game 14-4 against the second-seeded Oklahoma State.† † Game Two: UCSB loses in shutout to Arizona† † Not much went right for UCSB in this ballgame. Arizona scored in the first inning and that ended up proving to be enough in a ballgame where the Gauchos couldn't get the offense going. Starter Michael McGreevy tossed a solid start to the tune of 2 runs allowed in 6 innings. As for Arizona, their starter Garrett Irvin tossed a complete game with a 3-hit shutout. Subsequently, the Wildcats took the winners' bracket game 4-0.† † Game Three: UCSB has a d√©j√† vu victory over Oklahoma State † Just like in game one, the Gauchos' offense exploded in this game en route to a 13-3 victory. Also like in game one, the offense was led behind designated hitter Castanon, who had 3 hits, 2 doubles and 5 runs batted in. Starter Cory Lewis saved one of his most dominant performances of the season for this game, going 8 innings while allowing just 4 hits and 1 run and striking out 5 batters.† † Game Four: UCSB loses to regional winner Arizona † Unlike in the first meeting against Arizona, the Gauchos managed to get on base 12 times with 10 hits and 2 walks. The difference in this game was that the Gauchos left 10 runners on base, as opposed to Arizona leaving just 9 on base, even though the Gauchos accumulated more runners on base. Starter JD Callahan pitched well ""î going 5.2 innings while giving up 4 runs ""î but was taken out after allowing a 2-run homer in the sixth inning. That homer proved to be the game-deciding difference as the Gauchos added a second run, but the score was 4-2 in favor of Arizona. The Wildcats added one more run and ended up winning the ballgame 5-2. † The end of a spectacular season""¶ † Although the second loss to Arizona ended the Gauchos' season, this was a successful season for UCSB overall. The Gauchos finished with 41 wins, have a roster that is young with the likes of Jordan Sprinkle and Cole Cummings and will only get better with the experience of the conference regionals. With all the success came numerous awards for the Gaucho players, so stay tuned for a season recap! Comments are closed.

With 11 all conference players, and most being freshman or sophomores it is easy to see the future within the program. With freshman standouts like Sprinkle, Rodriguez and Lewis just to name a few, the Gauchos should be in good shape for the coming years. † Comments are closed.

There are a total of six groups with four teams each competing to make the knockout stages. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Euro was postponed to 2021 but has finally begun after a long hiatus.† † Group A Breakdown: Italy, Wales, Turkey, Switzerland † Favorite: † The favorite of the group has to be Italy. Coming off a disappointing past couple years, by not qualifying for the World Cup, this seems to be an Italy squad backed by experience and youth.† † Sleeper Team: † Wales is a group that could make the knockout round if they play as a team. Backed by individual brilliance from stars Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, if those two form a connection, they will be hard to stop this tournament.† † Group B Breakdown: Belgium, Russia, Finland, Denmark † Favorite: † Belgium backs some real firepower going into Euro 2020. First off, the attacking trio of Romelu Lukaku, Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard will be a force to contain, not to mention the world class goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, round out the group favorite.† † Sleeper Team: † Backed by premier league goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, defender Andreas Christensen and former premier league star Christian Eriksen, it is easy to see the solid depth and class amongst the Denmark squad. † Group C Breakdown: Netherlands, Austria, Ukraine, North Macedonia † Favorite: † The Netherlands roster backs one of the most creative midfielders in the competition, whether it be Donny van de Beek or Marten de Roon starting alongside Barcelona mainstay Frankie de Jong.† † Sleeper Team: † Being in an easier group, I could see Austria pulling off an upset if they are firing on all cylinders, but they'll need sublime performances from Marcel Sabitzer and David Alaba.† † Group D Breakdown: Czech Republic, England, Scotland, Croatia † Favorite: † This group was a tough choice, but the experience takes the upper hand as Croatia was just in the previous World Cup final and has their captain Luka Modriƒá playing excellent football.† † Sleeper Team: † Although they lack experience like the previous English squads, England has a dynamic attack featuring Marcus Rashford, Jack Grealish and Jadon Sancho.† † Group E Breakdown: Sweden, Slovakia, Poland, Spain† † Favorite: † Coming off disappointment in the previous World Cup, Spain is moving onto a new stage featuring young players like Rodrigo ""úRodri""ù Hern√°ndez and Ferran Torres and leaving off Spanish legend Sergio Ramos.† † Sleeper Team: † Sweden has experience with Emil Forsberg and Victor Lindel√∂f, while having the explosive attacking presence of Alexander Isak.† † Group F Breakdown: France, Germany, Portugal, Hungary † Favorite: † This has to be called this year's ""úgroup of death""ù featuring the defending World Cup champions, the 2014 World Cup winners and the defending Euro champions. With that said, France is experienced and has one of the best attacking trios in Karim Benzema, Kylian Mbapp√© and Antoine Griezmann.† † Sleeper Team: † Portugal being the sleeper team in this group is amazing with the likes of the legend Cristiano Ronaldo and up and coming players like Diogo Jota and Jo√£o F√©lix.† † Prediction: † Although it doesn't happen often, I see Portugal repeating as European champions due to the red-hot performances of their players. All their players put up career years, R√∫ben Dias at Manchester City, Ronaldo at Juventus and Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United.

sports,NCAA Athletes to Profit on Their Likeness After Supreme Court Ruling,4-Jul-21,3:41 PM,['Ethan Gardner'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-07-04/supreme-court-ncaa-ruling/,"Following years of legal battles over the extent to which intercollegiate sports programs can financially compensate their athletes, the controversy reached a cusp this week with two pivotal decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and the NCAA, respectively. The Supreme Court's decision, although narrow in its reach, marks the initial step forward for those who wish to see collegiate athletes paid for their work. This historic Supreme Court ruling will benefit players in the Men's Basketball program as it is one of the more popular sports at UCSB. Nexus file photo. The decision permits NCAA-affiliated sports programs to provide educational benefits for their athletes, which can include tutoring, laptops and technology, free academic opportunities, and other resources. The controversy lies in the fact that financial compensation of any kind would create a dynamic in which college athletes could be seen as employees, rather than students. While some welcome this change, others see it as blurring the line between amateur and professional sports. Regardless, these benefits can be critical for student-athletes who are balancing school, social and athletic responsibilities. The NCAA announced this week ""î in a subsequent step forward for college athletes ""î that beginning July 1, players will be able to profit off of endorsements and their likenesses. This marks another critical improvement to athletes' lives, as endorsements can provide substantial income for amateur athletes looking to profit off of their own images. ""úThe financial burden and stress can play a role in athletes' performances,""ù UCSB sophomore golfer Collin Yee said. ""úBy removing some stress and providing extra benefits, athletes can focus on what really matters: academics and athletics.""ù Previously, the NCAA had placed restrictions on such opportunities, most notably on the grounds that providing them would obscure the line between professional and amateur status for these athletes. The Supreme Court went against this argument, stating that the NCAA fails to accurately and consistently define amateurism within a collegiate athletic context. However, the Court did not reach beyond this baseline. The ruling only pertains to school-related assistance and therefore does not cover many of the areas in which athletes can be compensated to a high degree. The NCAA remains a powerful determinant of many factors in athletes' lives, and therefore much of the responsibility for changing the dynamic falls on them. The ball is in their court and, so far, they seem to be supporting their athletes. ""úCollege sports are a billion-dollar industry where, in the past, athletes had few ways of benefiting from,""ù Yee said. ""úNow athletes can be compensated for their hard work in their respective sports.""ù† The NCAA has accepted the precedent set by the Supreme Court and continued it by stating that they will work with Congress to establish guidelines and regulations for athletes on a national scale. This will create a foundation on which athletes can officially profit from their commitments. While there is still a long way to go before athletes are directly paid by the NCAA, many see this shift in player treatment as a huge benefit to college athletes. ""úI think it will encourage athletes and teams to show a better version of themselves as encouragement to be able to profit,""ù UCSB sophomore water polo player Perry Mikic said. ""úLots of athletes don't have the time for jobs so it would be very beneficial.""ù† Comments are closed.

Argentina and Messi are currently competing in the Copa America, while Portugal and Ronaldo were competing in the European Championship.† Messi has a chance to finally win an international trophy with Argentina. AP Photo / Matt Slocum  † Messi has led Argentina to the Copa America finals ""î the second biggest tournament for Argentina outside of the World Cup. On the other hand, Ronaldo has been knocked out of Europe's biggest tournament by Belgium in the round of 16.† As these major tournaments are coming to a close, many have to wonder if this is Ronaldo and Messi's last Copa America and Euro Championship. With that being said, this is Messi and Ronaldo's last chance to possibly add an international trophy to their ""úgreatest-of-all-time""ù resume.† Currently Messi holds the edge with more club accomplishments but only across one league and staying put at Barcelona. Ronaldo carries fewer club trophies but has had international success with Portugal, unlike Messi.† When talking about the greatest of a generation, one must point out the greatness of one player and the flaws of the other. ""úRonaldo has shown he can really succeed in any league with anyone. As great as Messi is, Barca is not really the same since Xavi and Iniesta left, who are I think arguably some of best midfielders to ever play,""ù lifelong Manchester United fan Narvin Amatya, who once got to see Ronaldo play in person, said.† As Copa America progresses this will be another major tournament Messi has been able to progress into with Argentina, including the World Cup finals loss. ""ú""¶ the only thing holding Messi back is his lack of international championships. Winning the Copa America and hopefully the next World Cup would cement his place as one of the greatest ever,""ù Diego Jasis, an avid Messi fan who shares an Argentinian background like Messi, said. †If Messi was to not win the Copa America with Argentina, it would spark a debate that Messi and Ronaldo's shortcomings in club and country would be the passing of the torch to the next generation. ""úThe era of those two as figureheads of the grandest clubs in the world ended with Ronaldo's departure from Madrid, so the iconography is less tangible,""ù Jasis said. Time and time with the two greatest to lace up in the world of football, their individual success still speaks wonders, as each are in contention to be the top scorers at the Euros and Copa America. ""úI think the era of Messi and Ronaldo is coming to an end unfortunately. They still have a few years left to play at the very top,""ù Amatya said. ""úBut now it seems that the torch is going to slowly be passed to the younger generation.""ù Determination matters

sports,Michael McGreevy Taken 18th Overall; Two Other Gauchos Chosen in MLB Draft,22-Jul-21,9:21 PM,['Oliver Bley'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-07-22/michael-mcgreevy-taken-18th-overall-two-other-gauchos-chosen-in-mlb-draft/,"Spanning Sunday, July 11 through Tuesday, July 13, the 2021 MLB draft marked another gradual step of the sports world returning to relative normalcy. Caveats were still undoubtedly present; the event overlapped with MLB's All-Star Break in July rather than its typical slot in early June. Reported by Baseball America's J.J. Cooper in early April, the delayed start was supplemented by the announcement that commissioner Rob Manfred and the MLBPA had settled on a 20-round draft. While reversion back to the usual 40-round format will have to wait another year (barring any bombshells in the collective bargaining discussions set to take place at the upcoming Winter Meetings), college and high school players, as well as general managers desperate to bolster depth, undoubtedly rejoiced. The 5-round format of 2020 which saw a plethora of big-league ambitions delayed or destroyed, while simultaneously forcing many clubs to reshuffle their volatile bonus allotment from lower ticket revenues, proved enough of a headache. Canceled or delayed seasons at the high school through the professional level were, nonetheless, met with tremendous determination. Continued analytical innovations, especially to accommodate remote scouting, are factors bound to be implemented for the foreseeable future. The Cardinals add an intriguing prospect to their franchise while UCSB gets more representation in MLB. AP Photo / John McCoy  With cross country travel still a significant concern, it's interesting to postulate whether teams emphasized drafting from regions where their scouts possessed the greatest familiarity. Randy Flores, the St. Louis Cardinals' director of scouting since August 2015 and an El Rancho High School and USC alum, certainly dug into his bag of West Coast contacts as five of the teams' 21 picks stemmed from southern California schools (with three of those being from Long Beach State, UC Riverside and UC Santa Barbara in the Big West). If Flores and his team indeed spent a majority of their time in California, they were certainly rewarded with some great talent. Together with St. Louis Cardinals' General Manager Mike Girsch and President of Baseball Operations John Mozeliak, Flores utilized the 18th overall pick on UCSB's sophomore pitcher Michael McGreevy. The Friday starter for the Gauchos this year is only the second 1st round pick in program history following Dillon Tate, whose memorable three-year career earned him the fourth overall selection in 2015.† † After enrolling in 2019, the 6-foot-4 McGreevy immediately became a staple in coach Andrew Checketts' bullpen. During that year, he appeared in 29 games for the Gauchos and finished fourth-best on the team with 53 total strikeouts and 7.91 strikeouts per 9 innings along with a team-low 1.94 ERA. His grit and dependability as a true freshman earned him All-Big West First Team and Freshmen All-American selections ""î something even Tate did not accomplish. After transitioning to the rotation for the start of his sophomore year in 2020, McGreevy continued to impress. In four appearances prior to the season's cancellation, he racked up 26 K's across 27.1 IP ""î which included back-to-back starts of 7.0 IP+ while giving up only a single ER.† † During quarantine, McGreevy's heightened discipline off the field ""î including a strict weight regime and diet ""î rewarded him with a durable 215-pound frame (which Flores believes they can still get up to 230) heading into his ""úsecond""ù sophomore season this year. He was nothing short of brilliant ""î striking out 115 batters against just 11 walks across 101.2 IP. His 10.45 K/BB ratio placed him second across all eligible pitchers in NCAA DI. While his 8.0-inning 15 K performance against Cal Poly on April 30 garnered headlines for being the fourth-best in UCSB's single-game record book, his outing two weeks later was arguably even more impressive when he racked up 12 K's across 6.1 IP against #22 UCLA. At his final outing for Coach Checketts at the Tucson Regional on June 5 ""î which with #5 Arizona, #23 Oklahoma State and Grand Canyon presented the Gauchos with one of the toughest roads to potential qualification for the College World Series ""î McGreevy again showcased tremendous poise across 6.0 innings despite being credited with the loss. Three days prior to the Arizona start, he was included in his second Big West All-Conference Team and without fellow teammate Rodney Boone's (Rd. 8, Pick 246, Cleveland Indians) miraculous 128 K freshman campaign would have certainly been solidified as at least one of the co-selections for 2021 Big West Pitcher of the Year.† † McGreevy enters the Cardinals organization as one of college's best strike throwers in recent memory. In analyzing the pick live, pundits such as Jonathan Mayo and Kiley McDaniel highlighted that his impeccable command alone presents him with the floor of a future mid-rotation starter. As a former shortstop at San Clemente High School, McGreevy boasts excellent body control which he has turned into a low-stress delivery. He pairs a sinking two-seam fastball† ""î which typically sits around 92-93 MPH but has been clocked as high as 96 MPH ""î with a slider, curveball and developing changeup. When placed on the 20-80 draft scale, his slider (60) grades as his best wipeout pitch. According to Synergy Sports in a statistic used by the YouTube channel Wheels, it was responsible for 55 of his 115 K's this year.† † On video, McGreevy certainly emphasizes painting the outside corner when pitted against right-handed hitters. Against lefties, he'll often stick to that same right side, trying to squeeze them. With his excellent control, however, there is no reason to believe he cannot diversify his pitch locations. Having just turned 21 on July 8, he's one of the youngest college prospects in his class.† † As mentioned above, big congratulations are also in order for Boone, as well as RS junior pitcher Christopher Troye (Rd. 12, Pick 346, Boston Red Sox) and junior infielder Marcos Castanon (Rd. 12, Pick 370, San Diego Padres). All three Gauchos had tremendous seasons, and while each of them may ultimately arrive at different conclusions about signing, the ecstasy of having their name called must still be sky-high.

This year looks to be the same case, as numerous U.S. athletes are heavy favorites for gold medals in Tokyo.† The 2020 Tokyo Olympics.†Credit: Luca Disbrow Beginning with a world-class group of sprinters, the U.S. men's sprinters feature a blazing fast Trayvon Bromell ""î who is the favorite in the 100-meter sprint ""î followed by a group of sprinters who could provide an upset. If Bromell doesn't follow through, other names to keep an eye on are Ronnie Baker and Fred Kerley. For the women's 200-meter sprint, Gabby Thomas seems to be the outright favorite in the event seeing as she posted the second-fastest time ever, only behind the best to ever do it, Florence Griffith Joyner.† Another U.S. gold medal favorite will be an already decorated swimmer: Caeleb Dressel. Dressel took home eight medals at the 2019 World Athletics Champions and looks to add to his medal totals at the Olympics this year. One of the United States' best gymnasts of all time is Simone Biles, who is once again favored in the all-around performance. On top of that, she has only gotten better in the events in Rio de Janeiro she medaled in, such as team, vault, balance beam and floor exercise.† Skateboarding features a prized street skateboarder, Nyjah Huston. Huston produces quite the resume for skateboarding with 10 X Games titles and four world championships in freestyle skateboarding. With skateboarding making its debut in the Olympics, it gives a chance for Huston to start the first competition with a bang.† Speaking of new events, baseball is a new event that was cycled out of the Olympics but is making its return in Tokyo. Team USA is currently not ranked No. 1 in the odds to win the gold, but this is due to their team consisting mainly of amateurs while the MLB season takes place. The difference being, even though the MLB season is not taking a break, there are several former MLB players on the roster along with loads of MLB prospects.† A sport Americans are very accustomed to watching is basketball, which is also featuring a team gleaming with loads of NBA talent. Newly crowned champions Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton will join the star studded group of All-NBA players like Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum.†† Staying on the newly added events, surfing has been added to this cycle, and you can't help but think of the four-time world champion Carissa Moore. The regular stanced surfer is currently No. 1 in the world and has six consecutive top-three finishes on the surfing tour this season.† Lastly, one of the most dominant teams at the Olympics is the U.S. women's water polo team, boasting an incredible record of gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. On top of that, they've won the world championships in 2015, 2017 and 2019. All in all, Team USA is favored for the most gold medals at this year's Olympics and should be in the driver's seat with amazing teams and individual athletes as mentioned above.† Comments are closed.

Specifically, the United States has had major success in track and field. In recent years, however, the newspapers and headlines have turned their heads towards one of the greatest athletes of all time, Usain Bolt.† The United States has many favorites in the sprints this Olympics.†Credit: Amberly Young With Bolt out of the picture, here enters the U.S. prospect who broke Bolt's junior record in the 200-meter dash. At an outside shot at the podium, 17-year-old Erriyon Knighton has his eyes set on the 200-meter dash this Olympics.† Another front-runner for the 200-meter dash is sprinter Noah Lyles. Lyles did not qualify for the 100-meter dash this year but holds the fourth-fastest time ever in the 200-meter dash, so should be the favorite in the event.† Moving on to the hurdles side of the track, 110-meter favorite Grant Holloway is going for the gold. Holloway came one-hundredth of a second away from breaking the 110-meter dash world record at the trials. If he were to break the record, it would be the second world record for Holloway this year, with the first coming in the 60-meter hurdles.† One of the best athletes on the planet, being a national champ from high school on, Rai Benjamin stakes his claim on the 400-meter hurdles. Before the Olympic trials, Benjamin owned the third-fastest time ever in the 400-meter hurdles. Following the trials, Benjamin moved into the second-fastest 400-meter hurdles ever recorded, making him the one to catch in Tokyo.† Moving on to the women's side of the track, you must mention the greatness of world-class sprinter Allyson Felix. The only other American track and field athlete with 10 medals is the great Carl Lewis. This just puts into light how great Felix is, as she has a chance to break Lewis's record, sitting on nine medals coming into the Tokyo Olympics.† Another accomplished women's sprinter is Sydney McLaughlin, who was only 17 during her first Rio Olympics. McLaughlin is in a class of her own, defying the 15 strides in between each hurdle to 14 strides between each hurdle which led to her world record of a sub-52 second 400-meter hurdles. With coach Bob Kersee by her side, she has a chance to break both the Olympic and world record during the Tokyo Olympics. Staying within the Olympic hurdles, one must mention the world record holder for the 100-meter hurdles, Keni Harrison. Although she broke the record in 2016, she did not manage to qualify for the 2016 Olympics, finishing sixth at the U.S. trials. Without a world title or an Olympic medal, Harrison, aged 28, will be running out of time to add to her world record resume.† Lastly, when mentioning women's sprinting, if the great Florence Griffith Joyner's name is brought up, something superb is taking place. In this case, sprinter Gabby Thomas ran a 21.61 in the 200-meters, marking her as having the second-fastest time in women's 200-meter history. Besides her resume of a degree in neurobiology from Harvard, Thomas is favored in Tokyo, like many of the previously mentioned athletes.† Comments are closed.

This squad that later was dubbed the ""úDream Team""ù dominated their competition and had an average winning margin of 43.8 points per game. Even after losing by almost 45 on average, players representing their nations were proud to just compete against all-time athletes and would take pictures with their idols after the final buzzer. However, the international basketball players of today's game have a different mindset. They don't want to take pictures; they want to win, and some actually have the talent to do it.† France and the United States battle for gold in the final match.†Luca Disbrow. Nowhere was this more evident than in the United State's exhibition games leading up to the Tokyo Olympics. USA lost their first two games as they faltered late against the inferior rosters of Nigeria and Australia. The Americans, led by All-NBA players Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard, brushed off these losses as just an opportunity to improve, as these NBA All-Stars needed time adjusting to playing with players at their level, while Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, and Kris Middleton were still competing in the NBA finals. These excuses did not hold up as the United States dropped their first game in Tokyo against France. The loss snapped a 25 game winning streak at the Olympics for the program that dated back to the 2004 knockout round. The team continued to be criticized as more and more doubt about the United State's success crept in.† The French were able to take advantage of what the opponents of the ""úDream Team""ù never had: NBA All-Star talent. Rudy Gobert is only one of an increasing number of NBA players that don't play for the United States who represent their countries in the Olympics. Dallas Mavericks phenom Luka Donƒçiƒá has willed his country, Slovenia, to the semi-finals in the Balkan nation's first-ever Olympic appearance. NBA Hall of Famers and brothers Pau and Marc Gasol represented Spain for the final time after winning their countries two silver medals together, while Pau won a bronze in 2016. This growing trend shows the talent gap in international basketball is closing fast and that the days of the United States steamrolling their competition at the Olympics may be behind them. Even with this reality, the United States still had the best team and was considered the favorite to win. After their loss to France, the United States won their remaining games in group play and were able to hold off Spain in the quarter-finals to set up a matchup with Australia, a team that rosters NBA veterans Patty Mills and Joe Ingles as well as All-NBA Defender Matisse Thybulle.† The Americans started their semifinal matchup slow as they found themselves facing a 15 point deficit. However, USA stormed back with a 31-6 run that Australia never recovered from. Kevin Durant was a force on both ends of the floor as he finished with 23 points and was a menacing rim-protector on the other end. The victory set up a rematch with France in the gold medal game and gave USA a chance for revenge. †The final was a closely contested matchup, however, the talent the Americans had was too much for France to hold off this time as they were forced to settle with their third silver medal for basketball at the Olympics. France's NBA players had good games again, but it was not enough to overcome a roster flooded with their professional counterparts. The five-point defeat stung for the French as Rudy Gobert left the court in tears. With the margin of error for the United States being the smallest it had in decades, this Olympic tournament may have been one of the greatest ever.

sports,United States Major Sports Took Major Victories at the Olympics,22-Aug-21,3:58 PM,"['Preston Espar', 'Garret Harcourt']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-22/united-states-major-sports-took-major-victories-at-the-olympics/,"Every four years the Olympics give some of the United States' best athletes a chance to compete for medals. Usually, these aren't your typical household names, as the Olympics have many specialty sports, such as javelin, synchronized swimming or diving to name a few. On the other hand, some of the U.S. major sports are still being represented in the Olympics, like soccer, baseball and basketball. The United States adding to its medal count. Luca Disbrow / Daily Nexus In its return to the Olympics, the USA baseball and softball teams showed up in a big way but ended in similar heartbreak for each of the teams.† The softball team had some dominant start to the Olympics winning the first three games in shut-out fashion. The next two games were close 2-1 victories over Japan and Australia, setting up the gold medal rematch against Japan. The scoring proved to be the downfall of the U.S., ending with them taking silver.† Since the MLB does not allow active MLB players to participate in the Olympics, the USA baseball team was composed of mainly veterans with prior MLB experience and young rising stars working their way to a major league roster. This combination of leadership and youth was good enough to get the U.S. to the gold medal game. However, the Americans had to settle for silver, as they were beaten by Japan, an Olympic team that had a multitude of professionals who play in Nippon Professional Baseball, including former Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka. The USA women's soccer team did not fare any better than these teams, taking a bronze medal at these Olympics. On the bright side, they qualified for the Olympics, unlike the U.S. men's national team. Also, this Olympics was possibly the last hurrah for Carli Lloyd and Megan Rapinoe, as well as other seasoned veterans who made a crucial impact on the team due to the Olympics only taking place every four years.† As for the U.S. basketball teams, they all finished with the best success of the major sports.† The USA men's basketball team got off to a cold start against a talented French team that featured lots of NBA talent, such as former defensive player of the year, Rudy Gobert, and veteran role player, Evan Fournier. Team USA rebounded, however, and won the rest of their games by a sizable margin, while getting revenge against France in the gold medal game. NBA MVP candidate year in and year out, Kevin Durant led the charge for Team USA with assistance from his all-star cast, such as Portland Trail Blazer Damian Lillard and Boston Celtic Jayson Tatum.† The USA women's basketball team got off to a hot start, beating everyone in the group stages and continuing the dominance en route to a gold medal by beating Japan 90-75. The bigs led the way for the team with Brittney Griner and Breanna Stewart each averaging 16 points per game. The gold medal was the seventh straight for the U.S. in this event.† Overall, each of the major sports the U.S. is known for fared well in meddling in all of the events featured in this year's Olympics.† Comments are closed.

sports,2021 National Football League Preview,30-Aug-21,2:47 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-30/2021-national-football-league-preview/,"On Sept. 9, the NFL will end a seven month hiatus as the defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers take on the Dallas Cowboys. Tampa Bay is returning with all of their starters from their Super Bowl triumph, including Tom Brady and a plethora of offensive weapons, against the Kansas City Chiefs in February.† Photo Courtesy of the NFL Tampa Bay will be a strong contender coming into the new season. They will be competing against a Dallas squad that is somewhat revamped as their star quarterback Dak Prescott returns from an ankle fracture and dislocation he suffered week five of last season. Both teams have rosters to finish as top five offenses in the NFL, and the NFL hopes that the matchup that kicks off the 2021 season will be a high-scoring affair. Another high-scoring offense in the NFL is Super Bowl runner up the Kansas City Chiefs. Led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, wide receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce, the Chiefs run a dynamic attack that leaves opponents in the dust. However, this unstoppable force hit an immovable object in the form of a strong Tampa Bay defense. In the 31-9 blowout, the Buccaneers held the Chiefs' offense to just 3 field goals. Kansas City will look to put that defeat behind them as they try to continue their dominance in their conference and compete for another Super Bowl.† Two other contenders in the American Football Conference (AFC), the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills, will attempt to move past Kansas City and secure a Super Bowl berth. Both teams are fortunate to have young elite quarterback talent, as Lamar Jackson of the Ravens was MVP in 2019 and Josh Allen of the Bills finished in the top two of MVP voting last year. Both rosters also have stout defenses that help to create well-rounded teams that have plans to win their division and then make a postseason run. In addition, the Ravens will potentially look to get revenge against the Bills in the postseason, as Buffalo eliminated Baltimore in last year's Divisional Round.† Another team looking for revenge after a bitter playoff defeat is the Pittsburgh Steelers. After starting the 2020 season 10-0, the Steelers faltered and finished the regular season at 11-5. The record was good enough to win the AFC North and set up a playoff match up against their division rivals, the Cleveland Browns.† The Browns shocked their opponents as they jumped out to a quick lead caused by turnovers and plays that had long gains. This defeat had a ripple effect on this season for Pittsburgh, as they decided to part ways with a majority of their veteran offensive line and replace them with younger and cheaper players.† The Steelers also used their first round pick on Alabama running back Najee Harris. The rookie running back is placed on a team with little to no competition behind him and will get the volume in both the running and passing game to compete for Offensive Rookie of the Year.† Many other teams also boast a large quantity of youth, such as the Miami Dolphins and the Washington Football team. Rosters like these will look to continue building their identity as they compete for playoff spots. Other squads, like the Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Rams, opt for more veteran players in the hopes that going all in will win the franchise a Super Bowl. With many teams looking competitive to start the year, this NFL season looks to be an entertaining one. A version of this article appeared on p.

sports,Men's Soccer Back with a Bang,30-Aug-21,2:30 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-30/mens-soccer-back-with-a-bang/,"UC Santa Barbara men's soccer is riding into this season off some recent success they are hoping to translate to this year's team. Back in 2019 ""î the last full season with all NCAA Division I teams playing ""î UCSB's men's soccer team made a surprise run to the final eight.† Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus This year's team is off to the right start after beating local rival Westmont College 3-0 in the Community Shield Game on August 21.† The Gauchos dominated this game with the first goal coming from a cross from sophomore midfielder Nemo Philipp into a dangerous area where freshman forward Salvador Aguilar was able to tap it in. The second goal from the Gauchos came from a free kick from about 10 yards outside the box. Freshman defender Lucas Gonzalez went around the Westmont wall to beat the keeper to the far right corner of the goal.† The last goal of the game also went the Gauchos way as the Westmont midfield turned the ball over on their own side to senior forward Ameyawu Muntari. From that point it was a simple assist to sophomore forward Finn Ballard McBride, where McBride easily beat the goalkeeper in a one-on-one finish to the keeper's right side.† The final box score posted numbers all in favor of the Gauchos. The Gauchos managed to have 9 shots on goal in the match, along with 21 total shots. The Gauchos also won more corner kicks than Westmont, acclimating 5 corners as opposed to 3 for Westmont.† The schedule gets more difficult as the year progresses, continuing against an always difficult Cal Berkeley team on Aug. 29.† This game highlighted many standout players whose names fans should become accustomed to hearing throughout the season. First off, Aguilar was a goal scorer in this game and had 2 other shots on target in the rest of the game. Although a freshman, Aguilar should be a force for the Gauchos this season as he is a product of the MLS team, San Jose Earthquakes academy. This academy has produced numerous players like San Jose Earthquake midfielder Tommy Thompson and Austin FC right back Nick Lima.† Another standout was Gonzalez, who was redshirted in 2019 due to injury. He scored in this game via the free kick and had 2 other shots. Like Aguilar, Gonzalez was a part of the MLS LA Galaxy academy which featured former standouts like midfielder Efrain Alvarez and USA international Julian Araujo.† Muntari is one of the more experienced players on the team, having been on the 2019 team that made the run to the final eight in the NCAA tournament. This could be his year to breakout like he did at Santa Barbara City College before coming to UCSB, earning him First Team Western State Conference Honors.† Lastly, McBride had an outstanding game with 3 shots and 1 goal. Among UCSB players, McBride may have the most experience outside of the collegiate soccer realm. McBride is a part of many Australia and New Zealand U20 training camps and also plays professionally for PC Kitzb√ºhel, who is in the third division of the Austrian leagues.† An honorable mention goes out to senior defender Adrian Adames, who will continue to be crucial to the defense, as he was an All-Big West Honorable Mention his freshman season. Being from Bilbao, Spain he most recently played for Santutxu FC, which is a part of the second highest youth league in Spain.†† A version of this article appeared on p.

sports,Messi and PSG's Staggering Summer Transfers,30-Aug-21,3:32 PM,['Jacob Davis'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-08-30/messi-and-psgs-staggering-summer-transfers/,"With the dust settling from Lionel Messi's historic transfer from his boyhood club, Barcelona, to nine-time French champions Paris Saint-Germain, it is likely that many are starting to come to terms with the reality that was the Summer 2021 transfer window. Though, it probably wasn't easy. Courtesy of Global Panorama Messi is such a household name in sports that those unfamiliar with the world of soccer will still recognize the name and the club associated with him for 18 years. News of his transfer likely stunned those with even the faintest of recognition.† He was, in the minds of many, a one-club player and undoubtedly loyal to the club that transformed him into one of the best players of all time. However, in December 2020, he expressed dissatisfaction with Barcelona and looked for an exit while also starting the rumors of a possible move to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). ""úI'm eternally grateful to the club for everything but it felt like a cycle had ended and I needed a change,""ù Messi said in the Barcelona press conference. Despite his unhappiness with the club management and desires for something new, Messi's loyalty to Barcelona remained strong, and he told the Barcelona fans he ""údid everything""ù in order to stay at Barcelona.† Messi hit the market as a free agent and though a reunion with former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola at Manchester City was favored, Messi seemed more interested in returning to play with former Barcelona teammate, Neymar. PSG landed Messi on a free transfer for a two-year contract at $29.4 million each year after tax with another $29.4 sign-on bonus. Messi was not the only quality player that PSG was able to sign on a free transfer. Other notable free agents include Real Madrid and Spain's talisman Sergio Ramos, Liverpool's Georginio Wijnaldum and European Championship goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Ramos, like Messi, is a legend of his former club and will offer tight defending with strong goal-scoring capabilities, more so than most other players positioned in the back line. Ramos became La Liga's top scoring defender in the Champions League's history in June 2020. Messi and Ramos have a complicated past due to the rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid, so the new dynamic should be an interesting one. Wijnaldum was crucial in Liverpool's Champions League and Premier League title wins as a facilitator in the central midfielder and will offer some great depth to the squad alongside mainstays like Marco Verratti and H√©ctor Herrera. Donnarumma was A.C. Milan's wall in the net, earning 71 clean sheets in his seven seasons there. He was also part of the Italian 2020 European Champions and was named Best Goalkeeper of the Competition and Player of the Tournament.† Wijnaldum has already made his debut for the French champions in Matchweek 1 of Ligue 1, helping them to a 3-0 start to the season. It is still unknown as to when Messi, Ramos or Donnarumma will make their starts at the time of writing, but the Aug. 29 match against Reims is a likely candidate.

sports,Gauchos Split Last Two Games Against Colgate and Stanford,14-Sep-21,5:05 PM,['Jacob Davis'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-14/gauchos-split-last-two-games-against-colgate-and-stanford/,"The Gauchos took their first loss of the season last Monday against a nationally ranked Stanford team.† Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus The team struggled in the first half being outshot 10 to 1 and giving up a goal in the 4th minute scored from a center ball to Stanford's redshirt senior forward Zach Ryan between a flurry of Gaucho defenders. Stanford doubled their lead early in the second half with a goal from junior forward and midfielder Ousseni Bouda, making him involved in both of his team's goals. Though down 2-0, the Gauchos had a burst of energy and ended up outshooting the Cardinals 9 to 5 in the second half and netting a consolation goal from junior midfielder Thaabit Baartman, his third of the season. UCSB sophomore keeper Leroy Zeller saved 4 of the 6 shots on goal in the loss. The small margin of the loss against No. 12 Stanford is a testament to the skill of this team, but work still has to be done according to head coach Tim Vom Steeg. ""úI don't think we've had that much of the ball in any one time we've ever played Stanford ""î that speaks well for us moving forward but we do have to eliminate mistakes, keep creating chances and improve on our finishing,""ù the coach said. The Gauchos then traveled to New York to take on the Colgate University Raiders on Friday. Coming off of their first loss of the season to Stanford, the team was looking to bounce back. The Gauchos came swinging early with 4 shots in the first 10 minutes of play. Their relentless attack continued throughout the first half with another 7 shots, 4 being on target. Just as hot as the Gaucho offense was their defense who stopped the Raiders to a single shot on goal in the 45th minute.† Despite netting 17 shots in regulation time, the Gauchos failed to convert, sending the game into overtime. Baartman and redshirt freshman defender Lucas Gonzalez were the standout offensive players taking half of the team's total shots. However, the lone goal was scored in double overtime by freshman forward Rene Pacheco after junior defender Henry Davies' deflected shot won the game for Santa Barbara. Pacheco's game winner reflects the depth the squad has as ""úHead coach Tim Vom Steeg went seven deep on the bench in the contest.""ù Zeller kept a clean sheet saving the 5 shots on goal from the Raiders. This clean sheet is his third of the season. The game was a physical one producing 9 yellow cards in 6 games from the Gauchos. Vom Steeg was proud of his players, but still had some critiques on their play. ""úWe played really well in the first half but didn't do well on set pieces. Some of the best chances you can get are when it's early in the game and the opposing team hasn't found its rhythm yet, but we weren't able to capitalize on that,""ù Vom Steeg said in an interview after the game.† ""úAfter that, they started believing in themselves and started playing harder, especially in the circumstance of it being alumni weekend and an otherwise emotional night. They stayed in the game and dumped balls into the box, and you have to give credit to Leroy Zeller for making two big saves for us.""ù The need for more consistent finishing seems to be the takeaway from both of these games and the Gauchos will have another opportunity to work on that almost right away. The Gauchos continue their east coast tour at Cornell on Sunday, Sept. 12 at 4 p.m. PST. Comments are closed.

This is their fourth game of the season that was decided within the second half of extra time, in which they have a 1-2-1 record. The team had their opportunities to convert as they racked up 13 shots ""î 6 of them on goal ""î but nothing came to fruition.  SIAVASH GHADIRI / Daily Nexus This game showed the inconsistencies within the Gauchos' attacking ability as a whole. This certainly was not the team that scored seven goals against University of San Diego. Senior defender William Gillingham had the most shots on the team with three, and senior forward Ameyawu Muntari was the only other player with more than one shot. Aside from the lack of finishing, the Gauchos looked strong in their time with possession and defending. The midfield controlled much of the pace of the game utilizing quick touches and passing to weave through the tight Loyola Marymot Unniveristy defense. The ball stayed on LMU's half for most of the first half, thanks to the dominance of the midfield and back line that forced LMU to resort to long balls that were comfortably read and handled by Henry Davies, Carson Vom Steeg and Gillingham. Much of their buildup started from the back line throughout the game, but the creativity and control began to falter as the game progressed, especially in the second half. Sloppy passes and fatigue seemed to overcome the Gauchos resulting in them being outshot by the Lions 7-4 in the half. Much of overtime play was characterized by back-and-forth loss of possession between both teams. Junior midf ielder Sam Fletcher made the lone attempt in the first half of overtime, but it was a meager attempt. The winning goal was scored off a corner kick with a header to the upper right corner of the goal, which just passed the outstretched arm of sophomore keeper Leroy Zeller. The Gauchos will travel to Oregon State to take on the Beavers Tuesday, Sept. 21 at 7 p.m. PDT. There, they will look to improve their finishing in the final third and tip their record in favor of wins. A version of this article appeared on p.

sports,"Powerhouses Collide This Weekend, Alabama and Georgia Remain Unscaved",23-Sep-21,11:57 AM,"['Garret Harcourt', 'Preston Espar']",https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-23/powerhouses-collide-this-weekend-alabama-and-georgia-remain-unscaved/,"Year in year out there are powerhouse college football teams expected to be in the Top 25 college football rankings. Brown (80) makes a touchdown catch on the back of Oklahoma's Michiah Quick (16). Nate Billings / The Oklahoman The first that comes to mind is the dominant University of Alabama Sooners, coached by the legendary Nick Saban. With Mac Jones and Devonta Smith moving onto the NFL comes the next group of future superstar players, including John Metchie and Bryce Young. Alabama remains undefeated on the year after surviving a scare from the University of Florida Gators this past week. The University of Georgia, ranked second in the nation, boasts an elite defense that held the national runner up, the Clemson University Tigers, to a mere three points. They are led by NFL hopeful and USC transfer JT Daniels, who led Georgia to success the past two seasons. The new riser in the rankings is the University of Oregon Ducks who upset the perennial powerhouse, the Ohio State Buckeyes. Ohio State lost their main facilitator Justin Fields, so Oregon, returning with most of their talent, was able to upset the Buckeyes in Week 2. Next in the rankings comes the offensive air-raid playstyle of the University of Oklahoma Sooners. Led by the top recruit of the 2018 class, Spencer Rattler, the offense was expected to be a force, with the defense much improved. Three games in, both sides of the ball have had troubles living up to expectations, but have managed three victories nonetheless. A notable name at No. 5 in the rankings is the University of Iowa who has sent numerous players to the NFL over the years. Specifically their tight ends have been standouts in the NFL such as, TJ Hockenson, George Kittle and Noah Fant. Iowa is hoping current tight end Sam LaPorta, who leads the team in receiving, will continue to dominate for Iowa at the tight end position. Another surprising school outside of the Power 5 conference schools is the University of Cincinnati Bearcats, who improved to 3-0 with a victory over the Indiana University Hoosiers of the Big Ten Conference. The victories allowed for the Bearcats to rise in the national rankings, as they are now the highest ranked team outside of the Power 5 and are No. 8 in the nation overall. The Bearcats will look to continue their undefeated season after a bye week against No. 12 University of Notre Dame. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are also 3-0 and are looking to make a statement on the road against No. 18 University of Wisconsin Madison. This matchup is one of the most anticipated in all of college football and will play a huge factor in the race towards the playoffs for these national contenders. Teams that should not be counted out include Texas A&M and Penn State. Penn State has survived two nailbiters to other ranked schools this season, No. 18 Wisconsin and No. 23 Auburn. Texas A&M will be a great football team as long as their great coach Jimbo Fisher stays at the helm of the college football powerhouse. A version of this article appeared on p.

Although they started out 1-6 in the 2021 season, they have won their last two at the UniWyo Invite. Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The team is building off of a canceled season and is only two years removed from winning a game in the NCAA tournament where they took on the number two seed Texas to five sets. Although the 2019 team only lost six games that year, they too, started on a winning streak that lasted into their league games. The Gauchos' first game against a ranked team this season came against the No. 21 ranked Pepperdine Waves. This was a close match with the Gauchos taking two of the first three sets before losing the latter two, leading to a loss. In the UniWyo Invite, the Gauchos started off with another loss, their sixth of the season in a five set match to Wyoming, whom they defeated in five sets in 2019. This loss is misleading, as the match could've gone either way, but Wyoming came out on top: 15-13 in the final set of the match. In the last two games of the UniWyo Invite, the team responded with two resounding wins. The first was over the SEC powerhouse Missouri in straight sets, and the second game was a closely contested four-set win over Northwestern. The Gauchos should be on a good track heading into their next fixtures taking place on home turf at the Thunderdome Classic. Throughout the young season, there have been loads of standout performers on the Gauchos volleyball roster. Sophomore Deni Wilson has been tremendous with a team best .416 kill percentage. She is also second on the team with 142.5 points as opposed to just 24 errors. A freshman standout is the points leader on the team, Michelle Ohwobete, who has accumulated 149.5 points on the young season. On the other hand, Ohwobete has a .234 kill percentage, which would put her in the lower percentile on the team. One player looking to turn the tables is junior hitter Sophie Messinger who has a troubling .107 kill percentage. If she cuts down on the errors, she would be a force on the court, as she has the fourth most total attempts on the team. All in all, this Gauchos roster is only two years removed from the NCAA tournament success, so there is reason to believe they can turn around the slow start to the season.

AP Photo / Mike Roemer The defending champions, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Los Angeles Rams are the only 2-0 teams that made the 2020 postseason, while the other five were mediocre at best last year and were on the outside looking in when the playoffs rolled around. One of the more impressive teams out of the remaining undefeated squads looks to be the Las Vegas Raiders. After the opening of their state-of-the- art stadium in Vegas ""î which ended their 25-year stay in Oakland ""î the Raiders had a disappointing year as they finished the season at 8-8 after starting 6-3. To start the 2021 season, the Raiders had a wild overtime victory against the Baltimore Ravens on ""úMonday Night Football.""ù Vegas continued their momentum against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 2 as their consistent offense, especially from quarterback Derek Carr, and improved defense combined for a complete team effort. At 2-0, the Raiders are tied for first place in the AFC West with the Denver Broncos. However, the reigning conference champion Kansas City Chiefs are not far behind at 1-1. After starting the season at 1-0 with a against the Cleveland Browns, Kansas City came out with a disappointing effort against Baltimore, as a late fumble by running back Clyde Edwards- Helaire allowed for the Ravens to run out the clock and escape with a 36-35 win. The defeat for Kansas City marks quarterback Patrick Mahomes' first loss in September since he was in college, as well as Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson's first victory against Mahomes and the Chiefs. Jackson was previously 0-3 against his conference rivals. Both teams will look to improve to 2-1 as the Chiefs take on the Los Angeles Chargers while the Ravens play the Detroit Lions. The Lions will look to get their first win of the season after coming up short on a comeback effort against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 1 and losing on ""úMonday Night Football""ù to the Green Bay Packers 35-17. After losing to New Orleans in spectacular fashion last week, Green Bay refocused and played a solid game in all three phases, while crushing an inferior divisional rival they were expected to defeat. Aaron Rodgers returned to his MVP form from last year while throwing 3 touchdown passes to running back Aaron Jones. Jones added a touchdown in the running game in addition to 115 total scrimmage yards. Green Bay will look to continue their NFC North title defense on ""úSunday Night Football""ù against San Francisco. Other heavily anticipated matchups in Week 3 include the Indianapolis Colts against the Tennessee Titans as well as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers against the Los Angeles Rams. The Colts have had a disappointing start to their season, as they've lost their first 2 games after making the postseason, while the Titans shook off a disastrous opener to beat the Seattle Seahawks in overtime for their first victory of the season. The winner of this matchup will be in the driver's seat of the AFC South early on in the season. The LA Rams and Buccaneers game is an NFC matchup of two teams who are looking to be in the Super Bowl conversation. A high- scoring affair led by the teams' respective quarterbacks, Matthew Stafford and Tom Brady, would not be surprising and should be one of the more exciting games of the week.

sports,Women's Soccer Comes Out on Top in Close Match,23-Sep-21,11:21 AM,['Ethan Gardner'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-09-23/womens-soccer-comes-out-on-top-in-close-match/,"The UC Santa Barbara women's soccer team secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory last Sunday, against a solid University of San Diego side with a strong defense. This helped break a 5-game streak without a win, signifying a potential change in momentum as the Gauchos prepare for conference play.  Over those last 5 games, the Gauchos found the back of the net only 3 times, while letting in 13 goals to the opposition. Despite these numbers, the ""òChos turned out a strong outing on Sunday, producing a clean sheet and 5 shots on goal. With the first Big West tournament game scheduled for Sept. 23, a change of pace was critical. ""úToday, I feel like we didn't make the same kind of massive mistakes [as the team had in previous games],""ù UCSB head coach Paul Stumpf said, according to the UCSB Gauchos website. ""úPitching a shutout for the first time in a while is almost as important as getting a goal.""ù Optimism appears on the rise, as a win against USD is no easy task. The Toreros took down Cal State Fullerton, Army, UC Irvine and Long Beach State in their 4-4 start to the season, all of which are formidable opponents and three of which are Big West divisional contenders. ""úUSD has had a strong preseason and has beaten three of our Big West competitors this year so it was really awesome to hold a good team to zero goals and close out with a win,""ù senior midfielder Lauren Moss said. ""úI feel like the win against USD was just what we needed for our confidence.""ù The Gauchos made this win happen by capitalizing off of their chances and holding fast defensively. They kept the pressure on USD throughout the first half, as freshman forward Leila Emmerson found the net twice with several well-placed shots before freshman midfielder Lauren Helwig notched one into the right side of the goal to give the Gauchos the lead in the 34th minute of the match. From there, the Gaucho defense starred, despite an aggressive offensive half from the Toreros. They were able to maintain the shutout, despite only having 35% possession. USD continued to push for the equalizer, managing to obtain 6 corner kicks and 5 shots in the second half, but a combination of some excellent saves by junior goalkeeper Evann Smith and a team effort on the defensive side of the ball kept the Toreros at bay. Following this win, the team can look forward to an exciting matchup against UC Riverside on Sept. 23. The team has big aspirations for the coming season, beginning with this game, as they look to compete for a division title for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic. ""úOur team's goal that we set forth at the beginning of the season was to make it to the NCAA tournament,""ù Moss said. ""úThe culture within our team this year is something special so I'm super excited to see what we can do as a team during conference play.""ù A version of this article appeared on p.

sports,2021 MLB Award Predictions,4-Oct-21,1:45 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-10-04/2021-mlb-award-predictions/,"As the Major League Baseball (MLB) regular season is coming to an end, there are many candidates to take home the best awards the MLB has to offer. Some awards are more certain than others, but with a week left, many of the top-notch starters will be resting as their teams clinch their place in the postseason.† Sierra Deak / Daily Nexus Starting with the most obvious award is the should be unanimous award winner of the American League Most Valuable Player, Shohei Ohtani. Hailed as the ""úBabe Ruth""ù of Japan when he made his MLB debut, it's safe to say he has exceeded his expectations.† With injuries taking a toll on his first two major league seasons, Ohtani has broken out this season with 45 home runs, 98 runs batted in and 24 stolen bases. On top of that, Ohtani has been one of the best pitchers this year, racking up 156 strikeouts and pitching to a 3.18 earned run average.† On the other hand, the National League MVP race is a little more uncertain with three names surfacing. The contenders are Bryce Harper, Fernando Tat√≠s Jr. and Juan Soto.† The argument to be made with Tat√≠s is the fact that he has had one of the best offensive years from a shortstop, despite the fact that he has been injured for a significant amount of time.† Harper's case can be made stronger if the Philadelphia Phillies make it to the postseason, but as of right now, he holds an impressive resume nonetheless. For starters, he has 34 home runs, a .433 on-base percentage and a .617 slugging percentage.† Soto has bounced back from a mediocre first half of the season to putting up ungodly second-half numbers. He is second in the MLB in batting average, first in walks, first in wins above replacement and second in on-base plus slugging.† With the impressive numbers of all these players, it would seem the deciding factor could be Harper's Phillies if they were to make the playoffs.† The American League Cy Young Award, which goes to the best pitcher, was just about settled a month ago to go to Gerrit Cole, but due to disastrous performances in his last outings, there is a new favorite in Robbie Ray.† Robbie Ray has an impressive 2.68 earned run average, 244 strikeouts, 7 wins above replacement and 23 quality starts, which are all the best among American League pitchers.† The National League Cy Young Award race also took a turn in the last couple weeks of the season as Corbin Burnes has been steady, Walker Buehler has had his troubles and Max Scherzer has been dominate since being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers.† Since joining the Dodgers, Scherzer has been the best pitcher in the league, maintaining a 1.43 earned run average and accumulating a whopping 7 victories with zero losses. The case for Scherzer over Burnes on the Milwaukee Brewers is he has pitched more innings, won more starts, allowed fewer hits despite more innings and has a lower WHIP at .83.† All in all, there is always a shock in the MLB end-of-the-season awards whether it be a unanimous selection or a snub at an award. One thing is for certain, this year's race to the top awards has been intense, besides the AL MVP which is favored to Ohtani for possibly the greatest baseball season we have seen in the modern era.† A version of this article appeared on p.

Both teams had to play with the pressure of 8,000 spectators that created a very lively atmosphere with their shouting and bombardment of tortillas.  Siavash Ghadiri / Daily Nexus Because spectators were not required to show their Covid-19 vaccination status, all entrances to Harder Stadium were closed after the stadium capacity reached 8,000 spectators. Max capacity for Harder Stadium is 17,000.† The Gauchos came out looking to attack early as tortillas began to trickle onto the field. The team spent much of the first half on Cal Poly's side but failed to produce any threatening attempts on goal. The Gauchos tried to move aggressively through the midfield ""î looking to their forwards, Salvador Aguilar and Finn Ballard McBride ""î on runs or one-on-one situations.  The physical strength and speed of the Mustang defense proved difficult to muscle through as the Gaucho attackers were continuously dispossessed before a shot could be made. The teams were in a deadlock for the first half as shots were kept to a minimum from both sides. UCSB only had 4 shots in the first half while Cal Poly had 3.† The match proved to be a physical one with plenty of fouls resulting in frequent pauses of play between the two rivals. The players fought hard for possession of the ball in one-on-one situations that led to the abundance of fouls. The Mustangs were especially aggressive with 13 fouls and 4 yellow cards to the Gauchos' 10 fouls and 1 yellow card.† Senior forward Ameyawu Muntari set the tone for the Gauchos in the second half with his attempted bicycle kick that just brushed the top of the crossbar in the 47th minute. The Gauchos became more dominant with possession as they confidently moved the ball across the field and took more chances on goal.  They racked up 10 shots throughout the second half while remaining defensively sound, only allowing 2 from the Mustang offense. Their build-ups became more purposeful, and the adjustment paid off.† The deadlock was broken in the 65th minute when a drive downfield ended with a cross from sophomore midfielder Jorge Aldana that was met by McBride with a header into the corner of the goal. After the goal, the field was bombarded with even more tortillas as fans began to celebrate. McBride netted the brace five minutes later, a successful play that initially began with a skillful dispossession from junior midfielder Sam Fletcher on a Mustang fast break.  The Gauchos instantly retaliated, and McBride capitalized on a through ball from Muntari and showed great composure with a shot across the net just past the Mustang goalkeeper to put the game away. The Gauchos will look to build on this confidence as it will be essential heading into the first conference game of the season at Cal State Fullerton. The team will travel to Fullerton on Wednesday, Sept. 29, to kick off the regular season of the Big West Conference. A version of this article appeared on p.

The Gauchos finished in fifth place with their 14-6 victory over the Pacific Tigers ""î the No. 8 team in the nation.† Nexus File Photo The No. 5 Gauchos began tournament play against their Golden Coast Conference rivals, the No. 13 UC Irvine Anteaters. With the victory, UCSB advanced to the second round of the tournament and improved to 12-2 on the year. UC Irvine dropped to 5-3 with the defeat. After a closely contested first period which saw the Anteaters and Gauchos tied at 4 apiece, the Gauchos were able to shake off their rust and take control of the game.† In the second period, UCSB had four different players score, as the Gauchos took a 9-5 lead into halftime. After playing a 2-2 third period, UCSB dominated again in the fourth, as their 4-1 final frame capped off a 15-8 victory. Senior Cole Brosnan led the Gauchos in goals scored with 4. After defeating UC Irvine, the Gauchos moved on to play the No. 3 Stanford Cardinals. The Gauchos were not competitive to begin the match, as Stanford held a 3-1 lead in the first period. However, later in the period, UCSB was able to tie the match at 3-3 with 2 goals from senior Leo Yuno. Even with these goals, UCSB still found themselves losing 5-4 at the end of the first.† This score would stand until late in the third period when the match was tied once again. Even with this late push, the Gauchos were defeated by a score of 12-10, as they were shut out by Stanford in the final eight minutes of the match. The defeat pushed UCSB into the elimination bracket and into a matchup with the No. 7 UC Davis Aggies. With both teams out of contention to be Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) Invitational champions, the Gauchos and Aggies battled for a spot in the match for fifth place. After another slow start from UCSB, the Gauchos found themselves down 3-1 after the first period.† After this, the Gauchos began to find the back of the net. With 3 goals from Brosnan, the Gauchos won the second period 5-2 and went into the locker room with a 6-5 halftime lead.† After UCSB gave up 3 straight unanswered goals, Brosnan scored his fourth and fifth goals of the night in addition to freshman Dash McFarland's goal to give UCSB a 9-8 lead heading into the final period.† The Aggies were able to retake the lead early in the fourth, but another goal from Brosnan and junior Sam Nangle put the Gauchos up 11-10. The Aggies were able to tie it once more, but a goal with 43 seconds left by junior Tommy Hawkins put UCSB up for good. Brosnan scored a season-high of 7 goals in the match. With their win against the Aggies, UCSB advanced to play in the match for fifth place against the Pacific Tigers. The first half of play was heavily contested, as the Gauchos only had a 1-goal lead at the half. In the second half, the Gauchos were able to pull away, as goals from McFarland and Yuno helped the Gauchos extend their lead to 10-5. Pacific was only able to muster one more goal the rest of the way as UCSB clinched fifth place at the MPSF Invitational. No. 1 USC won the tournament, while UC Berkeley finished in second place.

The match was a defensive battle resulting in a 1-0 loss for the Gauchos. Going into the game, the Titans were 3-7-0, whereas the Gauchos were 3-5-2.† Nexus File Photo The 250 fans in attendance saw a slow game in the beginning of the match as the Titans struggled to put up any shots on goal. On the other hand, UCSB began the match on the attack as they fired 5 shots. However, none of these shots found the back of the net. With only 5 corner kicks combined between the two teams in the first half, the action was minimal. The frustrated Cal State Fullerton players had 4 fouls as they tried to get things going with defensive plays, whereas the conservative Gauchos finished the first half with no fouls.† It was not until the second half when things got going. The Gauchos put up 7 shots to the Titan's 6, but the only shot of the game from Fullerton midfielder Karla Rodriguez, a header that crossed the goal line, made all the difference. Her goal in the 72nd minute was all Fullerton needed to defeat UCSB. It seems the yellow card issued to freshman defender Alyssa O'Brien in the 70th minute fueled Cal State Fullerton. Fullerton's goalie DeAira Jackson played at a high level, saving all 5 shots the Gauchos put on target. The offense for the Titans provided the bare minimum, but it was enough to secure a tough win on the road. Despite UCSB outshooting the Titans 12-6, one of Fullerton's 4 shots on goal that got past UCSB goalkeeper Evann Smith was the fatal blow. Even with the goal allowed, UCSB Head Coach Paul Stumpf had high praise for his goalkeeper and the rest of his team.† ""úI thought our goalkeeper [Evann Smith] played very well,""ù said Stumpf according to ucsbgauchos.com. ""úShe dealt with a number of longer-flighted balls in, a lot of set pieces and corner kicks, and she was solid. I thought Sophia Vivar had a pretty good day, and I thought Lauren Helwig did well when we moved her up to the nine, and of course Emma Vanderhyden as well.""ù The game elapsed a total of an hour and 56 minutes as the referee blew the whistle to give the Titans the 1-0 victory. The Gauchos hope to bounce back in their next road game against the UC Davis Aggies, while Cal State Fullerton takes on the UC Irvine Anteaters.  A version of this article appeared on p.

Although they didn't do well in the Thunderdome Classic, they rebounded opening up league play with two victories.† Daily Nexus File Photo The first game of the Thunderdome Classic was one to forget for the Gauchos as they were routed from the start against the Washington State Cougars. Throughout the 0-3 loss, the Gauchos made far too many errors, ultimately leading to their loss.† Game two of the Thunderdome Classic against Virginia Commonwealth University was another game where errors led to UCSB's main problems. Although the Gauchos lost the first set against VCU, they were able to make up for their errors by gaining more kills than VCU. So, the Gauchos reverse swept the Rams, leading to a 3-1 victory.† In the rematch versus Washington State, the Gauchos fell behind early to the Cougars due to a less superior kill percentage. In the third set, the Gauchos played a near-flawless set, making no errors while having 14 kills, en route to a 25-9 third set victory. In the end, the Gauchos lost the fourth set narrowly 21-25, due to the Cougars converting more of their chances.† On the other hand, the Gauchos responded with this loss with a commanding 3-1 victory versus the UC San Diego Tritons. The Gauchos had to rally from an opening first set loss. In the reverse sweep of the Tritons, outside hitter Abrielle Bross and middle blocker Deni Wilson led the charge with the highest kill percentages and most kills in the match. The Gauchos ended the match with 10 more kills than the Anteaters with 59 total kills and 17 errors which were 6 less than the Anteater's 23 errors.† The second match of league play against the UC Irvine Anteaters was one of the most impressive wins of the young season. The Anteaters had started off the season 8-4 with an opening league win. This makes the Gauchos performance that much more impressive, as they swept them in three straight sets. This was attributed to the Gauchos great blocking and defense as they only allowed Irvine to get 26† kills as opposed to their 50 kills. Right side hitter Tallulah Froley was the standout performer in this match, having a .478 attack percentage, along with a team-high 14 kills.† The Gauchos will be moving into conference play 2-0 and taking on rivals Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at their home stadium. Cal Poly comes into this game at a 4-9 overall record, but like the Gauchos, are on a hot streak, taking their first two conference games against Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State. The Gauchos will be looking to stay away from the unforced errors and staying hot in conference play and to open up October on the right foot this Friday. A version of this article appeared on p.

That proved not to be the case as the higher-ranked teams dominated the lower- ranked teams, with exceptions in the Florida versus Kentucky game and Stanford versus Oregon game. Rick Osentoski / USA TODAY Sports Starting with one of the two upsets of the week, the unranked Kentucky Wildcats beat the ninth-ranked Florida Gators. Although the Gators outgained them in the air and on the ground, the Wildcats had 115 penalty yards which contributed to their 7-point win. Then, in the Oregon versus Stanford game, the No. 3 Oregon Ducks were narrowly beaten 31-24 in an overtime game that could've gone either way. No. 1-ranked Alabama crushed the 11th-ranked Ole Miss Rebels behind a dominant run defense and superb rushing attack. Alabama's running back rushed the ball 36 times, racking up 171 rushing yards and 4 touchdowns. No. 2 Georgia showed why they have one of the best teams in the nation, dominating the No. 7 ranked Arkansas Razorbacks 37-0. Arguably the best defense in the nation shut out the Razorbacks and held them to a mere 162 total yards of offense. The No. 6 Cincinnati versus No. 10 Notre Dame game had significant impacts on the rest of the season's college football playoff. Cincinnati quarterback Desmond Ridder proved to be the difference-maker in the ballgame, throwing for 297 yards and 2 touchdowns. With Notre Dame not being in a conference, this drops their chances to make the playoffs and boosts Cincinnati's case since they are in a weaker division. In professional football, the NFL saw a week of upsets, broken records and bittersweet reunions. After both New York teams started 0-3, the Jets and the Giants were able to squeak by the Tennessee Titans and New Orleans Saints, respectively. Jets rookie quarterback Zach Wilson was able to secure his first victory as a professional, while Giants quarterback Daniel Jones continued his season of impressive play by throwing for 402 yards for the first time in his career while adding 2 passing touchdowns and 27 rushing yards. Another impressive upset was the Arizona Cardinals' road victory against the Los Angeles Rams. Both teams came into the game undefeated and looked to take control of the NFC West. Arizona and early-season MVP candidate Kyler Murray came out with poise and aggression as they defeated the Rams 37-20. The Cardinal's running backs had a day to remember as Chase Edmonds rushed for 120 yards while James Conner scored 2 touchdowns for his team. After four weeks, Arizona looks like a Super Bowl contender. On NBC's ""úSunday Night Football,""ù Tom Brady returned to New England for the first time after leaving behind a two-decade-long dynasty to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady was met with applause from Patriot fans and the organization played a video tribute to him on the jumbotron. Regardless of the sentimentality, Brady and the Bucs came to play as they defeated New England 19-17. A completion to wide receiver Mike Evans in the first quarter was enough for Brady to pass quarterback Drew Brees for the most passing yards in NFL history. The Buccaneers will continue their Super Bowl defense next week when they will take on the Miami Dolphins. A version of this article appeared on p.

The Gauchos also dominated defensively, having 10 blocks ""î two more than the Mustangs ""î and 55 digs, as compared to 34 digs for the Mustangs. Senior middle blocker Rowan Ennis was a standout player for the Gauchos, having 11 total chances and converting 9 kills while making only 1 error. Another great performance was turned in by the dependable sophomore middle blocker Deni Wilson, who had 12 attempts and 5 kills, committing no errors. Moving on to the second game on Saturday, the Gauchos had a hiccup in the second set, but other than that, outperformed Bakersfield. In the second set of the game, the Gauchos had a zero-kill percentage as they committed 11 errors and 11 kills with their 46 total chances. The other three sets proved to be no problem for UCSB as they went on to win each of the three sets at 25 points each with no additional set points to win. Ennis had herself a perfect game with a 0.5 kill percentage, 12 kills in 22 attempts and a mere 1 error. Freshman outside hitter Michelle Ohwobete had a great game per usual, notching 14 kills to go with a couple of errors in 29 attempts. Ohwobete had the second-most attempts in this game and the most in the first match against Cal Poly. An area where the Gauchos haven't been as effective is on the serve as they were outnumbered in both games in the serve aces. All in all, the Gauchos moved to 8-8 overall on the season, 4-0 in league play and 7-3 in their last 10 games. UCSB's women's volleyball team will go on to face Long Beach State on Friday and Cal State Fullerton on Saturday. The Gauchos will go in on a high note while Long Beach State and the Titans each took losses to Hawaii'iin their last conference games and are both 1-3 in conference play.

The victory and draw move the Gauchos to a record of 4-6-3 as they continue their last month of regular season play. The Gauchos currently sit in fourth place in the Big West standings and hope to move up the leaderboard before the Big West Tournament in November. Daily Nexus File Photo On Thursday, UCSB traveled to Aggie Soccer Field to take on conference rival UC Davis. The Gauchos began the game sluggish and continued their trend of struggling to score in games. UCSB barely tested UC Davis goalkeeper Nicki Rucki, as she was forced to only make one save in the first half. The Gauchos shot 4 other times but missed the target completely. Hawai'i was able to get 2 shots on goal; however, UCSB goalkeeper Evann Smith was able to send everything away. UCSB was forced to defend for most of the first half and did so aggressively by committing 7 first-half team fouls, as they also gave Hawai'i 3 corner kicks. UCSB was only able to attempt 1 corner kick in the first half. The slow start continued in the second half, as no goals were scored. However, the Gauchos tested Rucki a bit more by adding another 2 shots on goal. The UCSB defenders played well, as no shots on goal were conced- ed by the Gauchos for the rest of the game. No corners were taken in the second half, while both teams were called for fouls twice. With no change in the score, the match went to overtime. The overtime period finished after only a few minutes. In the 97th minute, UCSB forward Leila Em- merson fired a shot from her left foot into the right side of the net. The golden goal ended the game at 1-0 and put UCSB back into the win column after their 1-0 defeat against Cal State Fullerton. The goal was assisted by Shaye Douglas and Alyssa O'Brien. UCSB looked to carry their momentum over the Pacific Ocean as they went to Waipi'o Peninsula Soccer Stadium to take on Hawai'i. The Gauchos played with much more pace than they had in previous games and continued to attack Hawai'i goalkeeper Lauren Mar- quez. UCSB had 5 shots on goal in the first half alone. However, even with more chances, the Gauchos did not manage to score. Gau- cho goalkeeper Evann Smith played spectacularly, as she made 5 first-half saves. The attack gradually moved away from Hawai'i's side of the field to UCSB's as Hawai'i had 2 more shots than UCSB in the second half. The game became very physical, as both teams combined for a total of 13 second-half fouls. Smith was forced to make 1 more save, which was enough to send the game to overtime. The first half of overtime saw UCSB with a rejuvenat- ed attack as they had 3 shots in the 10-minute period. The final shot was the closest, as UCSB forward Elise Ziem hit the crossbar in the 100th minute. Nothing else came close to the goal for the rest of the game as UCSB and Hawai'i finished the game tied at 0-0. UCSB will look to get another positive result this Thursday as they continue Big West Conference play against the Cal State North- ridge Matadors. UCSB will take on CSU Bakersfield on Sunday.

The Anteaters did outnumber the Gauchos in shots on goal ""î 8 to 7 ""î requiring sophomore goalkeeper Leroy Zeller to make 7 saves on the night.

The Cal Poly Mustangs lost to UC Irvine to allow the Gauchos to hold the top spot alone. The Gauchos will play their next match at UC San Diego on Wednesday, Oct. 13, where they will fight to remain undefeated and the sole leaders of the conference.

Two classic rivalries, one between the longtime rivals, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, the other between playoff foes, St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons In the wildcard round, the Yankees got shut down by the Red Sox pitching as Boston's starter Nathan Eovaldi went 5 innings, striking out 8, while only allowing 4 hits.† On the other hand, the Yankees' 300-million-dollar man, pitcher Gerrit Cole, was expected to be the ace to pitch them to victory. However, Cole disappointed as he went a mere 2 innings, giving up 3 runs in the process.† †The Yankees went on to lose the game 6-2 and the Red Sox moved on to face the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Division Series.† †In the other wild card game, the Cardinals and Dodgers produced one of the best games of the year.†† Cardinals' pitcher Adam Wainwright and Dodgers' pitcher Max Scherzer each gave up 1 run before handing the ball over to their excellent bullpens that kept the game tied until the bottom of the 9th inning.† †At this crucial moment, the Cardinals brought on their closer pitcher Alex Reyes to face shortstop Chris Taylor, who was a late-game substitute for the Dodgers. On the fourth pitch of the at-bat, Taylor launched a walk-off 2-run home run to move the Dodgers onto the San Francisco Giants.† Moving on to the American League Division Series, the Houston Astros proved to the MLB that even after the cheating scandals, they are still a top-tier baseball team.† The Astros pulled off the 3-1 series victory against a very young Chicago White Sox lineup that should be around for many years to come.† On paper, the pitching rotation of White Sox's Carlos Rod√≥n, Dylan Cease, and Lance Lynn should have dominated most teams.

In the opening set of the match, the Gauchos had a .176 kill percentage as opposed to a .357 kill percentage by Long Beach State. They narrowly won the set 26-24 due to a couple of serving aces and serve errors by Long Beach State.† UCSB handily won the next set due to Long Beach State committing as many errors as kills with 10 apiece. Although the Gauchos also had a low .148 kill percentage, it was enough to win the second set.† In the final set, the Gauchos picked a good time to play to their potential, earning a .333 kill percentage compared to Long Beach State's .226 kill percentage.† The overall numbers favored the Gauchos as they had a .23 kill percentage in the match, 5 blocks and 6 more aces than Long Beach State.† The standout performers for the Gauchos were sophomore right side Tallulah Froley with a team-high 9 kills, senior middle blocker Rowan Ennis with 4 blocks, sophomore libero Macall Peed with 9 digs and freshman outside hitter Michelle Ohwobete with an impressive 4 serve aces.† Moving to the Saturday game, it was another dominant win by the Gauchos over Cal State Fullerton.†The Gauchos wasted no time attacking Fullerton, as they won the first set 25-13, having 20 kills and only 2 errors in the set.††In the following set, the Gauchos once again jumped out in front, winning the set 25-16 with 18 kills and 4 errors.†In the final set, the Gauchos had yet another easy path to the sweep, racking up 20 kills while making just 4 mistakes.† By the numbers, the Titans were outclassed in every aspect.

The Gauchos have now won five of their last seven matches and are peaking just in time for the Big West Tournament. Nexus File Photo The Gauchos began the weekend on Thursday night as they took on the California State University, Northridge Matadors at Harder Stadium. In recent games, the Gauchos struggled to create offensive pressure. However, UCSB came out blazing against the Matadors. A third-minute goal from senior midfielder Lauren Moss put the Gauchos up 1-0 early. The goal came from a set-piece as a freekick from defender Emma Vanderhyden sent the ball into the penalty area, where it then bounced off freshman defender Shaye Douglas' head to Moss' head. Moss had the perfect angle to head the goal in and give UCSB the advantage. Vanderhyden continued to make an impact for the Gauchos. In the 66th minute, another set-piece, this time a corner kick, rocketed off Vanderhyden's foot right to freshman defender Alyssa O'Brien who was able to head the ball into the upper corner of the goal and into the back of the net. The 2-0 victory marked the Gaucho's third straight game with no goals conceded. ""úThere's a team spirit about us ""î when things go badly, there seems to be no hesitation and they get back to work collectively,""ù said UCSB head coach Paul Stumpf, according to ucsbgauchos.com. ""úI think that's been a big part of our defensive run. Obviously, you have Evann [Smith] and our center backs Emma [Vanderhyden] and Gia [Cimring], and [outside backs] Elise [Ziem] and Alyssa [O'Brien] have been tirelessly working, but there seems to be a collective about the defensive side of the ball that's really good.""ù The Gaucho's momentum carried over into their next match against the California State University, Bakersfield Roadrunners. UCSB's early scoring continued in this match, as Douglas headed a ball into the net from a cross by junior forward Elise Ziem in only the 15th minute. The Gauchos doubled their lead in the second half when a goal in the 78th minute from Vanderhyden beat the Roadrunner goalkeeper Flavia Burrell. CSU Bakersfield had no luck on the offensive side of the ball, as none of their three shots tested UCSB goalkeeper Evann Smith. In contrast, the Gauchos were able to get 4 shots on goal.† The shutout extended the Gaucho's clean sheet streak to four. The Gauchos have not given up a goal in the last 6 hours, 44 minutes, and 35 seconds of play. With the goals from Vanderhyden and Douglas, there is now a four-way tie for the team-lead in goals scored. The defeat for CSU Bakersfield keeps them in last place in the conference, where they are still looking for their first win in conference play.† Now sitting at second place in the Big West, the Gauchos will have four more opportunities to surpass Cal Poly and take the first seed into the Big West Tournament. UCSB will look to keep that goal alive on Thursday against UC San Diego at Triton Stadium.

The Gauchos also managed to have 3 corner kicks, while the Tritons only had 1 corner kick and 2 offsides.† Although the Gauchos had 8 fouls in the contest, they managed to avoid drawing any yellow cards. Another notable achievement was that this was the Gauchos' second straight clean sheet and their third shutout in league play.† The next league game took place against rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. This game was a slugfest as both the Gauchos and Mustangs didn't manage to score throughout two overtimes.† The game was very choppy as no one was able to gain control in the first half of the game until the Gauchos finally started to control the game in the second half.† The Gauchos controlled the game in the second half, but Cal Poly presented more of a threat as the procession did not lead to chances but only opened the Mustangs' counterattack.† For the second game in a row, junior forward Thaabit Baartman had the most shots in the game for the Gauchos with 5 shots, and unlike in the previous game, he managed to get 2 shots on target.† The game, by the numbers, was similar on each side with the same number of shots and the Gauchos having 1 more shot on target with 3. One area the Gauchos look to improve in for the next game would be the execution with set pieces, as they managed to get 10 corner kicks in the contest with no goal coming from them.† One positive from the game was that the Gauchos' defense was able to keep its third consecutive clean sheet and fourth shutout in league play.† The Gauchos sit at the top of the Big West Conference with 14 points, 3 points clear of second-place Cal Poly.† Their next two games come against No. 7 Sacramento State and No. 4 UC Riverside.

The ending of the streak came only a few days after their 3-0 victory against the UC Riverside Highlanders on Thursday night.

The Gauchos were sharp defensively and forced UC Riverside to 7 attacking errors and an abysmal .122 hitting percentage. 25-20 was the final score of the first game. The second game was not much different for UCSB. The Gauchos stayed on the attack with a .517 hitting percentage and took an early lead in the game.

In the first set of the match, UCSB was able to acquire a 15-10 lead. However, the Aggies tied the game at 16 apiece. The teams eventually went to extra points to decide the set. After a back and forth, the Aggies were able to string together back-to-back kills to go up 1-0.† The second set of the match was not as competitive for the Gauchos. After going down 2-1 early, UCSB never recovered and lost the set 25-21. The Aggies hit 9 of their 19 blocks in this set and carried the momentum for the rest of the game.† Even with the Aggie's strong performance, UCSB was able to fight back in the third set.

Currently third in the Big West table, they have the potential to make a run at the Big West championship, which will be held on Nov. 7. Nexus File Photo Much of this early success can be attributed to a stellar defensive output from the Gauchos, who have let in just 3 goals in their 7 league appearances. In addition, they have yet to let in more than 1 goal in a conference game. Supported by big minutes from star defenders senior Emma Vanderhyden and freshman Shaye Douglas, the Gauchos managed a streak of 4 clean sheets before letting up 1 to UC San Diego in a 2-1 victory. Junior goalkeeper Evann Smith has been locked down as well, recording a conference play save percentage of 89.3%. In the Gauchos' most recent competition, they exhibited heart and class, coming back from a 1-0 deficit to beat the UC San Diego Tritons 2-1 away. After conceding in the 30th minute, UCSB turned the game around almost immediately and equalized from redshirt sophomore midfielder Skye Shaffer's first goal of the season, which was scored in the 37th minute. Senior Vanderhyden completed the comeback in the 79th minute, placing 1 in the right side of the net to give the team the go-ahead goal. With that shot, Vanderhyden also propelled herself to the top of the team in goals scored as well as total points. Even with the 2 goals, the Gauchos struggled to create offensive pressure for most of the night. UCSB was only able to get 3 shots on goal while the Tritons were able to fire 7 shots at Smith. The Gauchos made up for their lack of offensive aggression on the defensive side of the ball. In total, the Gauchos amassed a total of 13 fouls while UC San Diego committed 9. Following the win against the Tritons, the Gauchos look to a tough matchup against rival Cal Poly on Oct. 21. The Mustangs currently sit at the top of the Big West with a 6-1 conference record and wins against top competitors including Cal State Fullerton and UC San Diego. This game will have big implications for seeding in the Big West tournament, as a win could see the Gauchos take first place in the division.

The previous record for the 8K course had stood since 2014, set by David Perry of the University of Portland in the West Coast Conference Championships. Randazzo shaved one second off Perry's seven-year record to run the fastest time ever achieved for the course in a time of 23:24.2. ""úAll of us were a little surprised just how fast it was,""ù said Zachary Parker, a standout second-year competing in his first season of cross country with the Gauchos. ""úWe all expected him to run something like that. We knew he was super fit the last couple weeks. We expected it, but it was still really, really, fast.""ù The race, hosted by Santa Clara University, boasted strong competition with Randazzo's leading performance landing the Gaucho men in third place as a team. Portland State took home first place, while the Gauchos' rivals, the Cal Poly Mustangs, edged them out for second with a narrow 5-point lead.†† The result represents an all-time best over 8K for Randazzo and brings him to his second win of the season; he previously took home the individual title at the UC Davis Stump Invitational earlier this fall. Randazzo's win displays a progression from his 2019 performance at the Bronco Invitational, where he placed second to Utah Valley's Kevin Lynch.† ""úIt kind of took me by surprise,""ù Randazzo said on learning he had set the course record. ""úThat wasn't even on my radar going into it. But I think it's pretty cool definitely because it's a course that we go to a lot as a team, so we get to see a lot of compared times and how we stack up. A lot of people run the course, so it's pretty cool that I can say I have the fastest time.""ù† The fifth-year Gaucho is competing in his final season of collegiate cross country, and his stellar performance has his coach looking towards his future. Shayla Houlihan, previously a coach for Under Armour's elite professional running group Dark Sky Distance, and now in her first season coaching the Gauchos, explained what Randazzo's course record entails for him moving forward.
 ""úIt means a lot. It's huge. Especially since that course record was a long-standing record,""ù said Houlihan. ""úThere were a lot of really good men in that race when it was previously broken. So seeing now that that's the trajectory he's on, mixing it up possibly with men that are running professionally now on professional teams with contracts, I'm thinking big picture for him.""ù
 Randazzo's performance earned him his seventh Big West Cross Country Athlete of the Week Award, the conference announced Tuesday. Randazzo and the rest of the Gauchos will be looking to take home the upcoming Big West Conference Championship title on Friday, Oct. 29, at UC Davis.

sports,Men's Cross Country Team Takes First at Big West Championship,3-Nov-21,8:00 AM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-03/mens-cross-country-team-takes-first-at-big-west-championship/,"Cross country, one of the hardest yet most underrated D1 sports at UC Santa Barbara, had a great weekend at the Big West Championships, with the men's team taking first overall. Five of the nine competing Gauchos placed in the top 15, helping the men's team take their first conference win since 2015. Nexus File Photo The Gauchos traveled to UC Davis on Friday, Oct. 29, to compete against 10 other colleges for the conference title. Held on the grassy hills of the Wildhorse Golf Club, the women faced a 6K course and the men an 8K course. A great deal of credit goes to fifth-year Nick Randazzo, who finished second overall for the second straight year with a time of 23:43.5. For those unfamiliar with kilometers, Randazzo averaged an impressive 4:46 mile for nearly five miles.† ""úEverything came together for us when it mattered,""ù Randazzo said. ""úIt's fulfilling to see the results of our dedication, and we are all excited to finish the rest of the season strong.""ù Fifth-year Brian Schulz crossed the line in fifth, followed closely by sophomore Zachary Parker in sixth. The true story comes from fifth-year Jarett Chinn and senior Brandon Cobian, who placed 12th and 13th, respectively; Chinn brought the team from third to first as he moved from 22nd into 12th all within the last 2k loop.† The men's performance dethroned rival team Cal Poly, who holds 14 of the last 17 Big West Conference titles. The win was also significant for new cross country coach Shayla Houlihan, who coached the Gauchos into conference-winning shape within just eight weeks of joining UCSB. This is her first conference title. Women's cross country also competed last Friday, taking seventh overall. Leading the women's team was sophomore Sarah Auther, who crossed the line in 30th with a time of 22:06.6. Out of the nine women to travel, six were underclassmen. The 2020 season was cancelled due to COVID-19 protocols, meaning this was many of the athletes' first shot at racing collegiate cross country.† ""úWe came into this race kind of as underdogs because we lost two of our girls in the top seven and have a super young team,""ù Auther said. ""úWe were all just super thankful to be able to compete at all this year but are definitely looking forward to the future of the team as we gain more experience.""ù† In just two weeks, both the men's and women's teams will compete in the NCAA West Regional Championships in Sacramento, Calif.

sports,Ultimate Fighting Championship 167 Card,3-Nov-21,8:00 AM,['Luke Zimmerman'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-11-03/ultimate-fighting-championship-167-card/,"This past weekend, the Ultimate Fighting Championship returned to the sandy shores of Fight Island for the first time since January of this year to put on another amazing card of fights. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) 267 featured a headline bout between reigning light heavyweight champion Jan B≈Çachowicz and division stalwart Glover Teixeira. Teixeira withstood the champion's legendary Polish power and secured the rear-naked choke victory in the second round to claim UFC gold at the ripe old age of 42. The co-main event of the evening saw former bantamweight champion Petr Yan take on surging contender Cory Sandhagen for an interim title. After dropping the first two rounds to Sandhagen, Yan rallied and turned up the pressure to shift the fight in his favor and ultimately claim the unanimous decision victory. In doing so, the RCC Academy standout solidified a title unification bout against current undisputed champion Aljamain Sterling for later next year. Dagestani lightweight Islam Makhachev staked his claim at the 155-pound title with a lightning-quick submission victory over Dan Hooker just minutes into the first round. Russian heavyweight Alexander Volkov found himself back in the win column after a convincing unanimous decision over fellow divisional top-10 fighter Marcin Tybura. The Chechen hype train of welterweight super-prospect Khamzat Chimaev picked up even more steam this weekend as ""úBorz""ù put on a dominant display of grappling that ended in his opponent, Li Jingliang, being choked into unconsciousness toward the end of the first round. Light heavyweight contender Magomed Ankalaev opened up the main card with a shutout unanimous decision over Swiss knockout artist Volkan Oezdemir. The prelims offered eight more crowd-pleasing events to start the evening, with several up-and-comers earning impressive victories in front of an energetic Abu Dhabi crowd. Brazilian strawweight Amanda Ribas weathered some early adversity in her match against Virna Jandiroba to snatch a decision win. Zubaira Tukhugov narrowly edged out Brazilian featherweight Ricardo Ramos in a back-and-forth nail-biter of a split decision. Russian middleweight Albert Duraev defended his undefeated record against countryman Roman Kopylov with a straightforward, unanimous decision win. In the evening's lone bit of controversy, Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos brutally battered Frenchman Benoit Saint-Denis in a welterweight tilt that commentators demanded to be stopped following the second round. Referee Vyacheslav Kiselev's indecisiveness allowed for a visibly shaken Saint-Denis to see the beginning of the third round, despite the uncomfortable amount of damage inflicted on him in the closing minutes of the second. The card's third light-heavyweight clash had Polish prospect Michal Oleksiejczuk knocking out minor favorite Shamil Gamzatov in the first round for a tidy upset. Featherweight Lerone Murphy remained undefeated with a vicious knee knockout of Makwan Amirkhani just 15 seconds into the second round. Middleweight and ""úThe Ultimate Fighter""ù season-29 veteran Andre Petroski put on an imposing display of grappling control that ended with a third-round submission victory over his opponent Hu Yaozong. Flyweight Tagir Ulanbekov outlasted and overpowered the dangerous submission game of his opponent Allan Nascimento to clinch a close split-decision win in the first bout of the night. Overall, UFC 267 proved to be another exciting trip to the shores of Fight Island, UAE. Watch out for next week when the Ultimate Fighting Championship makes another historic trip to the Big Apple for UFC 268, live at Madison Square Garden.

The 119 points in the home opener was the second-most points a team has ever scored in the Thunderdome. The Gauchos were just 4 points away from tying the 123-point record set in 2020 against Bethesda University.†† Pablo Van Dyck / Daily Nexus Against San Francisco State, the Gauchos gave the raucous student section something to cheer for all night long. From the start of the first half, the Gauchos established their dominance in the interior. UCSB shot an astute 69.2% when inside the 3-point arc, while their total field goal percentage stood at 58.8%. The Gators' only lead of the night occurred early in the first period when a bucket put them up by 1. However, a 14-point run by the Gauchos in the middle of the half created some major distance as UCSB entered the locker room at halftime with a 27-point lead. Miles Norris, a senior starting forward for the Gauchos, found himself in some early foul trouble and was not able to play for the majority of the first half. In the second half, UCSB shot at a higher percentage while hitting 3 more 3-point shots. In addition, the Gators continued their shooting struggles as they saw their deficit expand. The Gators had no answer for UCSB junior guard Josh Pierre-Louis and senior forward Amadou Sow. Both players scored 25 points for the Gauchos, shooting at an efficient 69.2% or higher. Even with the solid shooting, the Gauchos struggled with turnovers as they coughed the ball up 18 times. But despite these ball security issues, UCSB continued to play a fast-paced game. ""úI think we have some really unselfish guards that pass the ball ahead,""ù UCSB Head Coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úWe have to do an even better job of running the floor. I think our guys can be a really good running team. We have a lot of great athletes. [Pierre-Louis] in the open court is spectacular.""ù The Gauchos' momentum did not carry over to their visit to Beasley Coliseum, where they fell to Washington State. The Gauchos came out sluggish as they quickly found themselves down 12 points early in the first half. The Cougars held UCSB to a shooting percentage of just 30.8% in the first half while shooting an effective 52.9%. Turnover struggles continued for the Gauchos as they already totaled 7 at the halfway point of the period. UCSB ended the half on a 9-2 run to cut the lead to under 20 points.†† In the second half, the Gauchos made a valiant comeback effort that in the end came up short. The Gauchos only turned the ball over once in the half and had a better shooting percentage than Washington State. Sow, the game's scoring leader, scored 16 of his 25 points in the second half. Every other Gaucho who took a large volume of shots consistently struggled throughout the game as freshman guard Cole Anderson's heave at the buzzer put the final score at single digits. The Gauchos will look to put their first defeat of the season behind them as they travel back to the Thunderdome to take on the Chicago State Cougars this Saturday.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Nov. 18, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The victory marks their first conference championship since 2010.† Offensive opportunities from both sides were few and far between in the first 15 minutes of the match, but the deadlock was finally broken by freshman attacker Ramses Martinez's solo attempt, netting him his 1st goal of the season. The ball came off an attempted clearance from an Anteater defender after a corner straight to Martinez, who slotted a one-touch shot through the flurry of players.† The only 2 shots on goal from the Anteaters came in the first half which were saved by sophomore goalkeeper Leroy Zeller ""î† who now has 9 clean sheets on the season. 7 of the Gauchos' 11 shots were on goal while the Anteaters threatened the net with 2 out of 11 shots. The game saw a good amount of action just before the half. First, freshman forward Salvador Aguilar scored his 6th goal of the season in the 44th minute after dispossessing an Anteater defender just outside their 18-yard box.† Aguilar followed with a shot across the face of the goal between the keeper and a defender. A minute later, the Anteaters were dropped to 10 men after midfielder Oscar Cervantes was shown a second yellow.† Junior center back Henry Davies recorded his 3rd goal of the season in the 54th minute from a corner kick after a scramble in the box. To really drive the game home, as well as his phenomenal season, sophomore forward Finn Ballard McBride scored his 9th goal of the season on a counterattack and was assisted by Martinez for his 2nd goal involvement in the match.† McBride was awarded the Big West Men's Soccer Championship MVP for his crucial offensive display. The Gauchos' solid season has earned them a spot in the NCAA Men's Soccer Tournament and they will take on the UCLA Bruins in the first round on Thursday, Nov. 18 at UCLA at 7 p.m. The match will be streamed on the Pac-12 website.

Sloppy play resulting in turnovers and bad shot selection found them in a hole early. What worked against San Francisco State in the season opener for the Gauchos resulted in little success against the Cougars. Defensive stops didn't come any easier to the Gauchos as the Cougars had an answer on both ends of the floor, leading 41-25 at the half.† The final score was largely misleading because the Cougars found ways to bolster their lead up to 20 multiple times in the second half. Any sort of traction the Gauchos would gain, the Cougars found ways to counter it and pile on to their lead. Rebounding and second chance opportunities got in the way for any sort of comeback to happen for the Gauchos as boxing out their opponent became more difficult as the game went on.† However, comeback efforts began in the final five minutes of the game where they were down 16. The offense used different sets and actions to exploit parts of the court they couldn't in earlier parts of the game. The energy picked up when Amadou Sow went on a run of his own to cut the lead down to 12 on two layup attempts. Besides Sow's offensive dynamics, the rest of the Gauchos offense couldn't be found to facilitate a real comeback due to Washington States ability to block shot attempts from inside the paint. Sow had a game-high of 25 points while shooting eight of 16 from the field and added 11 rebounds. Ajare Sanni tallied 12 points on four of 17 shooting. The Gauchos shot 23 of 59 from the floor (39 percent) and shot two of 13 from 3-point range.† The Gauchos look to bounce back on Saturday for a matinee affair with the Chicago State Cougars back at the Thunderdome. They look to replicate the same success they had in the season opener against San Francisco State with elite levels of shooting and crashing the boards to get their chances at second opportunities. Expectations: The Gauchos bounce back after their abysmal performance against Washington State and win big against Chicago State. They should look to correct their offensive miscues and look to settle for better shots instead of forcing shots when they lose their dribbles.† † † † Comments are closed.

sports,UCSB Men's Basketball Team Falls in Loss to Texas Arlington,7-Dec-21,7:01 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2021-12-07/ucsb-mens-basketball-team-falls-in-opening-night-loss/,"The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team saw their 2-game win streak come to an end on Monday night with a 70-62 defeat against the University of Texas Arlington Mavericks. The loss also ended the Gaucho's 20-game win streak at the Thunderdome and was UCSB's first defeat at home since 2019. Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus Senior forward Amadou Sow continued his strong start to the season with a game-high 23 points while shooting an efficient 66.7% from the field. In addition, Sow was able to grab 7 rebounds, and junior guard Josh Pierre-Louis had a game-high 11 rebounds. While Sow was the only UCSB starter to score in the double digits, three Mavericks starters scored 10 or more points. Two UCSB players off the bench, junior guard Calvin Wishart and graduate forward Robinson Idehen, scored 10 and 11 points, respectively. Idehen also totaled 2 blocks for the Gauchos.† The Gauchos struggled shooting the ball all night. UCSB was only able to capitalize on 11 of the 22 free throws they were awarded, while they shot a below-average 21.4% from behind the 3-point line.† UCSB played a sloppy first half that saw the lead go back and forth. The Gauchos were able to retake the lead consistently due to their ability to draw fouls and slow the pace of play. However, a late run by UT Arlington saw the Gauchos down by 7 with little time left in the first half. UCSB took advantage of the time remaining and cut the Mavericks' lead to 2 when the halftime buzzer sounded.† The Gauchos came out slow again in the second half with a scoring drought that lasted 4 minutes. During this drought, UCSB allowed UT Arlington to extend the lead to double digits. As the half progressed, the Gauchos increased their defensive intensity. They were able to hold the Mavericks to a shooting clip of just 39.1% for the half. However, these recurring stops did not translate to success on the offensive side of the court. The Gauchos committed 10 turnovers in the second half and had 18 total turnovers at the end of the game. Fortunately, the Mavericks were only able to score 9 points off these Gaucho turnovers, so even with the offensive errors, UCSB was able to stay in the game. Consistent stops and timely buckets saw the Gauchos cut the lead down to 5 points with 2 minutes to go. However, UT Arlington was able to force the Gauchos into more turnovers which led to the go-ahead bucket for the Mavericks. UCSB will look to start a new winning streak at home this week as they close this streak of home games. On Friday night, the Gauchos will take on the Pepperdine Waves, while they will play the Cal Lutheran Kingsmen on Sunday. After these games, UCSB will travel to Moraga to match up against the Saint Mary's Gaels. A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Dec. 2, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The Bruins were riding high coming into the matchup being No. 22 in the nation and on a three-game winning streak, beating the top-ranked Oregon State team.† This game was a back and forth affair for each side as the game ended up going into a golden goal format in the second overtime.† The first half was an even affair as the Gauchos managed to get 1 shot on goal while the Bruins didn't get a save from the UC Santa Barbara sophomore goalkeeper, Leroy Zeller. Zeller got to work in the second half, however, managing 5 saves. The first breakthrough of the second half came with a goal from freshman attacker Ramses Martinez in the 54th minute. With Zeller providing outstanding goalkeeping, UCSB thought they had it all but won. With five minutes remaining, freshman forward Jose Contell equalized for the Bruins, forcing the game to go into overtime.† In the first overtime, there wasn't much action as there was only 1 shot on target from each side and no goals to show for it.† Unfortunately, in the second overtime, the Gauchos conceded a goal to the Bruins, and the golden goal rule insinuates it's the first goal to score wins.† Although this goal ended the Gauchos' season, there were many standout performers for the team this season.† Sophomore forward Finn Ballard McBride led the way for the Gauchos this season, having a team-high 9 goals and also a team-leading 7 assists.† Junior forward Thaabit Baartman was second in each of those categories with 7 goals and 5 assists.† Zeller had an outstanding season in the net completing 9 shutouts while having a .804 save percentage on the season and an even more impressive .810 save percentage in league play.† In league play, freshman forward Salvador Aguilar and senior forward Ameyawu Muntari provided the spark up front, having a team-high 6 goals apiece.† All in all, although the Gauchos came up short nationally, they still had an outstanding season finishing both the regular season and the conference tournament on top.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Dec. 2, 2021 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

(Chris Puga / Daily Nexus) Leading up to the contest, the Gauchos were in a tough stretch of games as they started October with a draw, then a three-game win streak. From that point on, they lost to their rival Cal Poly, then to UCI, and bounced back in a shaky win over Long Beach State leading into the Big West Tournament. By the end of the month, the Gauchos were placed as the four seed. Due to the shaky month of October, the Gauchos were placed as the four seed against the top seed, UCI, who they had previously just lost to. The semifinal match between the Anteaters and the Gauchos had some stat lines you don't see too often.† The only goal of the match came from a penalty kick goal by junior midfielder Scarlett Camberos of UCI, with the goalie of UC Santa Barbara picking up the yellow for the foul in the box. The Gauchos outshot the Anteaters in the second half, forcing 2 saves from Irvine sophomore goalkeeper Glo Hinojosa.† In the end, the Gauchos could not convert their chances in the second half, leading to the loss and a late yellow card which forced a red card to the Gauchos' junior goalkeeper, Evann Smith.† Looking at the end of the season's statistics for the Gauchos, one standout performer was senior defender Emma Vanderhyden who led the Gauchos with 3 goals, 4 assists and 10 points.† Two freshman standouts were defenders Shaye Douglas and Alyssa O'Brien, with Douglas picking up 7 points with 3 assists and O'Brien having 6 points with 2 goals and assists apiece. Overall, the UCSB women had 10 players with a shot on goal percentage at or above .500 percent, so it was a matter of finishing chances for the Gauchos.† Although the Gauchos' goalies managed 7 shutouts, the defense was a bit of an issue throughout the season, forcing over 4 saves a game from the goalie.†† On the season, the Gauchos finished with 8 wins, 9 losses and 3 ties, while having 6 wins, 3 losses and 1 tie in conference play. Although they did not perform their best in conference play, the Gauchos still managed to put together a successful turnaround to make it into the Big West Tournament.

Nexus Photos/Joshua Yepez-Martinez UCSB's winning streak began with a 73-62 victory over Florida A&M. The Gauchos were able to jump out to a 7-point lead early in the first half. However, Florida A&M went on a run of their own to take a 15-13 lead. This was the last moment of sustained success for the Rattlers. The Gauchos were able to dominate the rest of the half to take a 41-23 lead.† The Rattlers were more competitive in the second half, but it was not enough to overcome their 18-point deficit. Florida A&M was able to cut the lead in the final minutes, but timely UCSB free throws put the game away. The Gauchos' team-oriented style of play allowed for the team to have 4 double-digit scorers and 14 assists. Two Florida A&M players tied for the game-high in points with 16 each. Sow became the fourth Gaucho in program history to have 1300 points and 700 rebounds.† The Gauchos looked to start a winning streak in their matchup against Idaho State. Once again, UCSB started the game hot and took a 10-point lead. This cushion did not last long, as the Bengals went on an extended run and even took the lead late in the first half. A 3-pointer from senior forward Miles Norris gave UCSB a 27-26 lead at the half.† In the second half, the Gauchos were able to pull away. UCSB extended their lead to 7 points early in the half and never looked back. The Gauchos outscored Idaho State by 12 in the final half and secured a 56-43 victory. Sow led both teams in scoring with 18 points, while the Gauchos continued their success passing the ball by getting 15 assists.† UCSB will look to continue their winning streak on the road ""î a place where the Gauchos have struggled this season. The game will be the Gaucho's Big West season opener as they take on the UC San Diego Tritons. After winning the Big West last year, UCSB will have a target on their back in every conference matchup.

sports,Attendance Policy Remains Unchanged,17-Jan-22,6:04 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-01-17/attendance-policy-remains-unchanged/,"After the administration's decision to have instructors decide if their courses should be held in person beginning Jan. 18, UC Santa Barbara Athletics has made no new announcement regarding fan attendance. As of now, UCSB will not be admitting fans until the 17. Just outside the three-point line, Coco Miller takes a shot. Christina DeMarzo/Daily Nexus The original decision to delay fan attendance for the winter quarter directly correlated with the school's decision to have all learning done remotely. However, now that some students will be returning to campus, the athletic department's choices have become more complicated. UCSB will need to make a decision soon, as the men's basketball team plays at home only three days after the original ban on fan attendance is lifted.†† UCSB Athletics may choose to continue their attendance ban or have limited capacity to keep players and staff safe from the Omicron variant that is sweeping through the country. Both the men and women's basketball teams have already been affected by this new variant as games where opponents had COVID outbreaks were canceled. With prior experience with the omicron variant, UCSB Athletics understands that seasons could be delayed or ultimately canceled if a program experiences an outbreak. Having hundreds of fans breathing on student athletes would not be the best way to protect the programs at UCSB or keep competition going.† As things stand, UCSB students can assume that attendance will be allowed after Jan. 17. However, a new announcement from UCSB Athletics will be made in the coming days regarding whether or not the Gaucho faithful can support their student athletes in the future.†† At the end of the day, the main goal of UCSB Athletics during this pandemic is to protect their athletes and staff, as well as the student body as a whole. With data at their disposal, prior experiences with Omicron and the administration's decision to hold in-person classes to some extent, the athletic program at UCSB can be expected to make the best decision possible when it comes to safely having fans return to athletic events.

During the streak, UC Santa Barbara has dominated their opponents, winning the games by no less than 8 points and beating Bethesda University by a score of 117-28. Allison Fann/Daily Nexus Their most recent win came against their rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in a blowout, winning by a margin of 21 points. Although the Gauchos are on this 5-game winning streak, it was put to a halt due to COVID-19 complications that have taken place in college and professional sports, like with the National Hockey League putting a stop to their season as of last month. Luckily, the Gauchos' season was not canceled, but they were unable to play their opening game of the Big West Conference against UC San Diego. Also because of cancellations, they were not able to play UC Irvine for another Big West matchup on New Year's Day. Although they have had their last two games canceled, the Gauchos have been putting up great numbers on the court this season. Senior guards and forwards Megan Anderson and Taylor Mole have had a hot hand on the court this season with Anderson shooting 50.8 from three on 59 attempts and Mole shooting 54.5 from the 3-point range. The top scorer on the team is junior center and forward Ila Lane, who is shooting an impressive 59.0 from the field and leading the team in scoring by having 115 points in total. On the defensive side, she has been a force as well, leading the team with 1.4 blocks per game and being the only one on the team averaging a block. Senior point guard Danae Miller is putting up solid stats with 3.4 assists per game while averaging the second-highest time with 28.1 minutes a game. The other point guard on the squad is junior Johnni Gonzalez who is averaging 3.4 assists per game while adding 1.4 steals per game on the defensive end. As a team, the Gauchos are putting up impressive numbers despite not having the best shooting stats. The UCSB women are averaging 69.8 points per game while shooting 42.1% from the field, 29.4% from the 3-point line and 72.4% from the free-throw line. The defensive side of the Gauchos are excelling with opponents averaging 58.8 points per game, while shooting 38.7% from the field and 27.6% from the 3-point range. The Gauchos as a squad are also averaging 9.2 steals per game and 3.6 blocks per game. The UCSB women's basketball team will look to keep this winning streak up and stay undefeated in Big West conference play against Cal State Bakersfield.

The Gauchos currently sit in last place in the Big West, and their three conference losses have already tied their conference losses from last year. The Gauchos' total record is 7-7, with every victory coming at the Thunderdome. UCSB has yet to win a game on the road, as they currently have a 0-6 road record.† Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus The Gauchos began Big West play with an 85-83 overtime loss to the UC San Diego Tritons. This close defeat was followed by a 65-58 loss to Long Beach State. The Gauchos had an 8-point lead at the half against the Beach but gave up 39 points in the second half to eventually lose by 7. UCSB has struggled on defense in the losing streak, having given up an average of 76.3 points. The defense will need to get back to 2021 levels if UCSB wants to remain competitive in the Big West this year.†† However, long stretches of not playing may be contributing to the Gauchos' subpar play. The first three games of the new year for UCSB were canceled due to COVID-19 outbreaks among the men's basketball programs at UC Irvine, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Cal State Bakersfield. Without a consistent stretch of games to begin conference play, the Gauchos lacked the playing time to be consistent on defense. The defense's struggles continued against Cal State Fullerton. After the Gauchos allowed for the Titans to go on a 12-point run and tie the game at 39 points apiece, the Gauchos gave up 40 points in the second half. The Titans shot 51.9% from the field while also shooting over 50% from behind the 3-point line. The Gauchos shot 41.8% from the field and 43.5% from behind the arc. Overall, UCSB committed 13 turnovers, while the Titans had 18 of their own.† Freshman guard Cole Anderson led the team with 21 points off the bench, and senior guard Ajare Sanni led all UCSB starters with 12 points. Senior guard Damari Milstead led all Titans in scoring with 21 points. The Titans only played two players off the bench, with one of them only playing for three minutes. For comparison, the Gauchos had six players come off the bench, with forward graduate Robinson Idehen playing for 21 minutes. Freshman guard E.J. Anosike played the entirety of the game for the Titans.† The Gauchos will look to get their first conference win against Cal State Northridge on Jan. 25. The game will end a streak of ten days without a game played for the Gauchos, as games against UC Riverside and UC Davis had been canceled due to COVID-19. With a victory, the Gauchos' record at home would improve to 8-1.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 27, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The UCSB indoor season overall consists of three travel meets along with indoor nationals. While indoor track and field events look similar to their outdoor formats for jumps and most throws, there are a few critical changes. The hammer throw transforms into the weight throw, the 100-meter open and hurdles shorten to 60 meters, and the 400-meter track becomes only 200 meters. The harsh curve of a 200-meter track is banked to help athletes handle the force of the turn at great speeds. Visually, the warped, condensed oval appears daunting, yet the enclosed nature of indoor facilities allows cheers to echo and adrenaline to peak, making indoor track and field a unique experience. The UCSB women had a strong showing with standouts in every event. Senior Gabby Sanchez threw a personal best in weight throw ""î 15.96 meters ""î placing her in second overall. Freshman Jessica Boyd placed third in the open 60 meters with an impressive time of 7.75 seconds, missing the school record by just 0.04 seconds.† However, the most monumental feat came from junior Mariana Lanz, whose 24.78-second 200-meter time earned her second place and a new UCSB indoor 200-meter record. Lanz's race took 0.12 seconds off the previous record of 24.90 seconds, once held by Hailey Ray.† ""úThe indoor 200 is my favorite event,""ù Lanz said. ""úI always feel so fast when I get to run down the bank.""ù Lanz also had a strong season opener in the triple jump with a mark of 11.82 meters, scoring her second place. She later closed the night as part of the 4√ó400 relay, with a remarkable split time of 55.68 seconds.† Coaching at UCSB since 2019, Assistant Coach Josiah Norville has been an integral part of Lanz's development. ""úI'm proud of her that she got to see her work to fruition,""ù Norville said of Lanz. ""úShe's had some setbacks over the last couple of years so it's good to see her work pay off now.""ù On Jan. 28, the UCSB women will head to the University of Washington to compete once again against dozens of competitive schools. With more school records in reach, anticipate another exciting meet for the Gauchos. A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 27, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

However, the Gauchos dropped their next game to the Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors. UCSB now sits in 9th place in the Big West Conference with a conference record of 1-4. Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus UCSB got a much-needed win against CSUN after starting 0-3 in the Big West; the worst record in the conference at the time. Not only was it the Gauchos' first conference victory, but it was also the first road win of their season. Senior forward Miles Norris dominated the Matadors the entire night, as he scored a career-high 31 points and had an extremely efficient 10-of-12 night of shooting.† The Gauchos jumped out to an early lead by starting the game on a 10-0 run. However, as the first half progressed, CSUN was able to claw back. When the buzzer signaling halftime sounded, the Gauchos only held a 2-point lead. This blown lead can be attributed to UCSB's turnovers, missed free throws and fouls at the end of the half.† In the second half, UCSB looked like an entirely new team. Even while only up by 2 at the half, UCSB was still able to win by almost 30 points; the Gauchos outscored CSUN 38-13. Norris continued his dominance in the half and, at one point, hit 4 straight 3-pointers. In the half, CSUN was held to only 20% shooting, as UCSB cruised to victory.† †Senior center Amadou Sow was the second-highest scorer for the Gauchos with a total of 17 points. No other player for UCSB scored more than 7 points. The leading scorer for the Matadors was senior guard Elijah Hardy who scored 13 points. In the next game, UCSB fell to Hawai'i by a score of 65-62. This time, it was freshman guard Ajay Mitchell who led the Gauchos in scoring by racking up 16 points. Sow acquired his second double-double of the year with a 13-point and 13-rebound game.† In the first half, it looked as if the Gauchos were going to win their second game in a row. UCSB began the game on a 13-2 run and, at one point, was up 23-4. This was the largest lead for either team in the game. Before the half ended, Hawai'i was able to get consistent defensive stops and cut the lead down to 11 points. The Gauchos had no momentum left in the second half. Hawai'i continued their defensive intensity and was finally able to take the lead with just over 8 minutes left. Hawai'i shot 7-of-10 from three. With the victory, Hawai'i remains undefeated in Big West play and holds first place in the conference. UCSB's next matchup will be against the UC Irvine Anteaters this Thursday as the Gauchos look to get their second conference win of the season.

The Gauchos lost by less than 10 points ""î a trend seen in all UCSB conference losses this season. In their 53-52 defeat, UCSB started out slow. In the first half, the Anteaters shot 50% from the field, hitting most of their open shots. UCI led by as many as 15 points, however, senior forward Miles Norris' dunk ignited the Gauchos' offense, as they were able to cut the lead to 12 at the half.† UCSB led a comeback in the second half, but it was ultimately not enough. This comeback can be attributed to the Gauchos' defensive and offensive intensity. The Anteaters were only able to shoot at a clip of 33.3% in the second half, while UCSB was able to consistently draw fouls to stop the clock and shoot free throws. A late three by freshman guard Cole Anderson and a 5-second violation by UCI gave the Gauchos a chance to win as they were only down by 1 point. However, on the final possession, Anderson missed the potential game-winner as the shot clock expired.† Senior forward Amadou Sow led the Gauchos in their valiant comeback with 17 points and 11 rebounds.

Both teams began the game shooting well, however, the Tritons could not get consistent stops on defense throughout the entire first half. The Gauchos went on an 18-2 run, and from that point on, the game was never competitive. Norris scored 21 of his points in the opening half, as the Gauchos shot an efficient 74.1% from the field compared to UCSD's 39%. At the half, UCSB led by 22 points.† The Gauchos did not let up when the second half began and immediately increased their lead to 30 points.

Both halves of basketball were dominant displays of the Gauchos as they found themselves with the lead for the rest of the game after the first 3 minutes.

The Bengals had an uphill battle in order to make it to this year's Super Bowl and were often the underdogs in a majority of their games.† Beginning in the Wild Card Weekend, the Bengals were tasked with beating a red-hot Las Vegas Raiders team.† In the game, the Bengals duo of rookie sensation Ja'Marr Chase and second-year quarterback Joe Burrow carried the Bengals to a close 7-point victory. Chase put up 9 catches for 116 yards while Burrow threw for 244 yards, along with 2 touchdown passes. From there, the Bengals picked up another close victory, this time a 3-point margin over the Tennessee Titans. Again, Burrow had a huge game for them, but this time the defense played outstanding getting interceptions from Mike Hilton, Jessie Bates III and Logan Wilson.† Then, as if the other games were not close enough, the American Football Conference championship game versus the Kansas City Chiefs went the distance, with the game ending up going to overtime. In overtime, the Bengals were able to get an interception against the Chiefs' elite quarterback, Patrick II, and iced the game with a walk off kick from placekicker Evan McPherson.† Moving to the National Football Conference (NFC) division, the Rams were able to get the Super Bowl through the use of their veteran guys and also players they got from free agency or traded for.† In the Rams' Wild Card Weekend, they were matched up against divisional foes, the Arizona Cardinals. Although they split the regular season series this was a blowout, with the Rams winning by a score of 34-11. The next matchup was versus one of the greatest quarterbacks to play the game, Tom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which they won by a narrow margin of 30-27. Their newly acquired quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for 366 yards and 2 touchdowns, while their superstar wide receiver, Cooper Kupp, managed to haul in 9 catches for 183 receiving yards. Their most recent victory, in the NFC championship game came against another division rival, the San Francisco 49ers. They took the victory in comeback fashion 20-17. In the game, the wide receiver duo of Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. managed to combine for 255 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns. This Super Bowl matchup will feature some of the biggest names in the sport, some being big names featured on new teams.† On the Rams' side of the football, there is the most dominant nose tackle in the last decade with defensive tackle Aaron Donald and star pass rusher Von Miller, who was acquired this season from the Denver Broncos. Along with them, there is defensive superstar Jalen Ramsey at cornerback, and then veteran safety Eric Weddle who came out of retirement to join the Rams on this Super Bowl run.† Lastly, on the offensive side of the ball, the star duo of Kupp and Beckham have been tearing it up ever since the mid-season signing of Beckham. Then, you cannot forget about veteran quarterback Stafford, whom they got from the Detroit Lions and his blind side protector, Andrew Whitworth, who is the oldest active National Football League player. As for the Bengals, they feature lots of young talent on the offensive side of the ball. The trio of Chase, Tee Higgins and C.J. Uzomah makes up one of the hardest receiver duos and tight ends to stop in the league.† Burrow has developed into a premier signal caller after coming off a devastating leg injury and surpassed expectations, leading his team to the Super Bowl.† Defensively, the Bengals were able to put together solid veterans that have stepped up in a huge way. Cornerback Chidobe Awuzie was seen as a filler signing for the Bengals until the draft but has quietly become a solid piece to the defense, much like the signing of Trey Hendrickson, who became one of the league's best pass rushers.† Bates is an elite safety, becoming one of the league's best over the past couple of years, and is paired in the secondary with the ex-Steelers cornerback Mike Hilton, to form a dynamic secondary. All in all, this Super Bowl will be a battle of the underdog Cincinnati Bengals versus the Sean McVay-led Rams, who will be looking for more success than their last Super Bowl run in their brand new home stadium in Los Angeles.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 10, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Then in the same season, James Nunnally went undrafted to the Philadelphia 76ers and most recently played for the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2020-21 season. Although he is out of the NBA at the moment, Nunnally is still playing professionally overseas for the Maccabi Tel Aviv Basketball Club. In the 2015 NBA draft, Alan Williams was the next to go undrafted into the NBA, making his way onto the Phoenix Suns' roster. Williams was last on the Brooklyn Nets in the 2018-19 season and now also is overseas playing for Lokomotiv Kuban.† The two most recent UCSB alumni in the NBA are the only current players active in the league. Gabe Vincent and JaQuori McLaughlin are both guards in the NBA who came from successful seasons at UCSB.† Coming into UCSB out of Stockton, California, Vincent was stellar as a freshman, winning the 2015 Big West Freshman of the Year while averaging 10 points per game and shooting 42% from the field. The accolades continued to roll in for Vincent during his four years playing at UCSB, as he was a 2016 All-Big West Honorable Mention, a 2017 Academic All-Big West and a 2018 Second Team All-Big West to cap off his UCSB career. Although Vincent piled up the accolades during his time at UCSB, it did not lead to him being drafted into the NBA. So, he was picked up as a free agent by the Miami Heat on a two-way contract with their G League-affiliated team. In the G League, Vincent thrived in his second year, averaging 23 points per game, shooting 47% from the field. This earned Vincent a call up to the Miami Heat where he provided a decent stat line off the bench averaging 5 points a game and shooting 31% from the three. This current NBA season Vincent has stepped up big for the Heat, being a huge contributor averaging 9 points per game, 3 assists and 24 minutes per game.† Not only that, but Vincent also competed in the Olympic games with Nigeria, being an intricate member of the team's lineup. The most recent NBA player from UCSB, McLaughlin, had a different path to UCSB. Being the 93rd best player in the nation coming out of high school, McLaughlin chose to go to a bigger program, Oregon State. Holding 13 school records and being named an Associated Press First-Team All-State twice, McLaughlin was expected to contribute huge to Oregon State and ended up getting numerous awards his redshirt freshman season.† After an outstanding freshman campaign, 6 games into his sophomore year, McLaughlin decided to transfer to UCSB.† †Progressively getting better every season, his third and final year at UCSB McLaughlin averaged 16 points per game, 5 assists and 1.5 steals. This stat line was enough for the point guard to earn the Big West Conference player of the Year and the Big West Tournament MVP, which was the first time a player won both since 2012.† UCSB set new precedents with McLaughlin as their point guard, setting records for consecutive wins and consecutive conference wins, and earned them an NCAA tournament bid.† In the end, McLaughlin remained undrafted by the NBA teams and ended up signing a two-way contract with the Dallas Mavericks. Although he hasn't featured much in their games, McLaughlin is still a rookie and could follow the same path as Vincent, featuring for Dallas's G League team for a couple of years.† All in all, the Black athletes to come out of UCSB's basketball program have generated great success at the next level and are more than deserving to get recognition this Black History Month.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 17, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

This is especially true when it comes to baseball, as there are numerous professional players who once called Isla Vista home. This Black History Month, the Daily Nexus is celebrating Black professional athletes who attended and played for UCSB.†† Hari Patel/Daily Nexus According to Baseball Almanac, there have been three Black MLB players who played college ball for the Gauchos. Erik Johnson, Quinn Mack and Dillon Tate all worked their way up the minor league ladder to make it to the big leagues.† While putting in solid years for the Gauchos, Johnson was drafted in the 27th round of the 1986 MLB June Amateur Draft by the New York Yankees. However, Johnson stayed in college for another year to increase his draft stock. In the next year's draft, Johnson was taken in the 18th round by the San Francisco Giants.† Johnson spent most of his career in the minor leagues, playing 10 seasons trying to achieve his dream of playing in the MLB. In 1993 and 1994, his wish came true as he was called up for a total of nine games. During his time in the major leagues, Johnson got a total of 4 hits, including 2 doubles, and was able to score 1 run. After a successful and lengthy minor career, Johnson is now the EJ Sports founder and president/director of baseball player development. After playing for UCSB, Mack went undrafted but was able to catch the eye of MLB scouts. After starting in Single-A in 1987, Mack made his MLB debut in 1994 for the Seattle Mariners.† In his five games for the Mariners, Mack was able to get 5 total hits ""ì 3 of them doubles. Mack was also able to score once and steal 2 bases. After being sent back down to the minors, Mack continued his professional career and even had a short stint playing in Mexico.† Tate is by far the most successful Black athlete to ever play baseball for the UCSB Gauchos as a pitcher. After an extremely successful college career, Tate was considered one of the top prospects in the upcoming MLB Draft. In the 2015 MLB June Amateur Draft, Tate was selected fourth overall by the Texas Rangers. After starting in the Rangers' minor league system, Tate was then traded to the Yankees in 2016. Two years later, Tate was traded again, this time to the Baltimore Orioles.† It was with the Orioles that Tate made his major league debut. In 2019, Tate made his MLB debut and pitched 21 innings. He finished the year with an 0-2 record and a 6.43 ERA. In 2020, Tate got his first win and finished the year with a 1-1 record. Tate pitched 16.2 innings and had an ERA of 3.24. In 2021, Tate saw the most playing time of his young MLB career. In 67.2 innings pitched, Tate finished with an ERA of 4.39 and was able to strike out a career-high 49 batters.

The win marked head coach Joe Pasternack's 100th win as UCSB's head coach, a feat he accomplished in only 143 games, making him the fastest to the mark in school history. The Gauchos advanced to 4-5 in the conference and 12-10 overall as they look to end the season strong traveling to The Pavilion to take on a UC Davis team that sits one game ahead of the Gauchos in the conference on Feb. 24. The ""òChos will play three more games before they take on the Big West tournament with the winner clinching a spot in the NCAA tournament.

sports,UCSB Baseball Starts Season Strong With Series Victory Against University of San Francisco,1-Mar-22,5:22 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-01/ucsb-baseball-starts-season-strong-with-series-victory-against-university-of-san-francisco/,"The Gauchos came out of the opening series against the University of San Francisco with the series victory, taking 2 of 3 games.†  In the opening game, the Gauchos played a sound game, committing no errors while the pitchers only allowed 5 hits. Sophomore right-handed pitcher Cory Lewis pitched a solid game, striking out 10 batters across 4.2 innings pitched, with the only blunder being he allowed 2 solo home runs. Coming in relief, sophomore left-handed pitcher Mike Gutierrez produced a dominant debut, striking out 5 batters across 4.1 innings and allowing just 1 hit and a walk across the innings in relief.† Being down and going into the 8th inning, senior catcher Gianni Bloom got the scoring started, driving in sophomore outfielder Steele Ledford with an RBI double. In the same inning, sophomore outfielder Nick Vogt singled in another 2 runs, extending the Gauchos' lead to 4-2. Then, to add on, Ledford bunted in another run in the 9th inning to seal the Gauchos' 5-2 victory.† Game 2 for the Gauchos was more of a sloppy affair, leading to their eventual loss. The first 2 pitchers for the Gauchos, sophomore right-handed pitcher Ryan Harvey and sophomore right-handed pitcher Nick Welch, kept it close but were bitten by the longball, giving up a 2-run homer with each having the Gauchos fall behind on both occasions. During the 8th inning of the game, the Gauchos gave up another 2 runs to San Francisco, but in this case, each run was unearned as there was an error committed by the second baseman and the pitcher, leading to each run and the Gauchos' eventual 6-3 loss.† Luckily, Game 2 didn't last long in the Gauchos' head as they headed into the third game with their bats and arms red-hot. Starting off the scoring for the Gauchos was an unearned run from sophomore infielder Jordan Sprinkle, on a play in which sophomore outfielder Broc Mortensen was thrown out at second base. After an answer from the opposition in the 2nd inning to tie it, that was the last of their scoring as UC Santa Barbara went on a 10-0 unanswered run.† During the 5th inning, the Gauchos got it going, with solo home runs from Mortensen and Vogt. The 6th inning all but sealed the game as sophomore catcher John Newman Jr., junior utility player Christian Kirtley, senior outfielder and infielder Jason Willow, junior infielder Kyle Johnson, Mortensen and Vogt all picked up RBIs to make it a 11-1 ballgame. As for the arms, the bullpen provided a shutout behind sophomore right-handed pitcher Michael Rice, freshman left-handed pitcher Michael Splaine and freshman right-handed pitcher Matt Ager, while starter freshman right-handed pitcher Ryan Gallagher struck out 5 across 4.1 innings.† Overall, the Gauchos had a strong opening series and will look to ride the momentum against Loyola Marymount University and then the University of Nevada for their weekend series.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Feb. 24, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Featuring a red and blue striped 200-meter track, jump pits, throwing rings and bleachers, the cavernous room becomes a hub of athleticism. Renowned for its Mondo surface ""î a synthetic rubber that gives more return force than average tracks ""î the best athletes come ready to set a personal record.† Nexus File Photo The annual Don Kirby Elite Invitational hosted by the University of New Mexico was no exception. Attendance included dozens of top-tier schools in the Pac-12, Big West and Mountain West conferences, including a selection of the UC Santa Barbara women's track and field team. The Gauchos competed well, holding their own against national champions and clocking numerous personal bests. The big event of the weekend was redshirt sophomore Morgan Simon's performance in the pole vault. With a vault of 3.82 meters, or 12 feet 6.25 inches, Simon surpassed the previous UCSB school record of 3.71 meters. The mark earned her first place in her section and represents a collegiate best for Simon.† ""úI am just so grateful for all the support I have received from my coaches, especially Bill Whitaker, who continues to help me progress,""ù Simon said. ""úI am also thankful to have such supportive team members, family and friends.""ù† ""úProgressing into the outdoor season, my goal is to continue to set new personal records and improve while staying physically and mentally focused. I am really looking forward to the upcoming season!""ù As pole vault is one of the few track and field events that remains the same both indoors and outdoors, Simon's mark foreshadows a successful spring season.† Other notable performances of the weekend came from redshirt sophomore Emma Barthel and redshirt freshman Jessica Swalve. Barthel ran a lifetime best in the 200-meter dash, clocking just 25.09 seconds. The time moved her to third overall on the UCSB indoor records list. Barthel also performed well in long jump, jumping 5.53 meters and earning second in her flight. Swalve set a personal record in the 60-meter hurdles with an impressive time of 9.18 seconds, which moved her to seventh on the UCSB all-time list. When asked to reflect on the women's indoor season, Head Coach Cody Fleming said, ""úIt was a successful indoor season for our women. Indoor track is still relatively new here, as we've only had it since 2009, so to have two indoor records with Mariana [Lanz]'s 200m and Morgan [Simon]'s pole vault was great to see.""ù ""úWe made sprint finals, won heats, made it into field event finals, won jumping sections. I think we built some momentum heading into the outdoor season, and I'm looking forward to seeing that growth keep evolving within our team.""ù The Gauchos look ahead to their first outdoor track and field meet on March 4 at Long Beach State.

sports,"Five Years Later, USA Women's Soccer Wins Equal Pay",7-Mar-22,6:37 PM,['Abigail Monti'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-03-07/five-years-later-usa-womens-soccer-wins-equal-pay/,"On Feb. 22, 2021, the U.S. women's national soccer team's six-year battle for equal pay finally concluded, resulting in a victory against gender discrimination.† Ida Kazerani / Daily Nexus The original lawsuit, which accused the U.S. soccer committee of wage discrimination and unequal working conditions, was filed in 2016 by players Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Becky Sauerbrunn and Hope Solo. When that was unsuccessful, 28 players went on to sue the U.S. Soccer Federation again in 2019. They argued that female players were consistently paid less than male players despite their greater success, which is an understatement of dramatic proportions. The women's national team holds four Olympic gold medals and four World Cup titles, while the men's national team has never won either. Despite this staggering fact, in 2020, presiding Judge Robert Gary Klausner ruled against the U.S. women's national team's demands for equality.† Yet, the U.S. women's national team persisted, filing an appeal in 2021 that eventually found its way back to court. Despite years of denial, the U.S. Soccer Federation agreed last week to pay $24 million in settlement money. A total of $22 million will go directly to the athletes as compensation for years of unequal pay, and the remaining $2 million will create a fund for charity grants and the players' post-career goals.† One reason, among many, for the women's victory after six years of fruitless lawsuits is Cindy Parlow Cone, who replaced Carlos Cordeiro in 2020 as the first female U.S. Soccer Federation president. As a former player for the women's national team, Cone understood the pressing need for equal pay and helped execute the demands of the U.S. women's national team. Though the agreement does not come close to the $66 million of back pay initially demanded, most of the players agree that the smaller settlement still represents a substantial victory for female athletes everywhere. More significant, perhaps, was the U.S. Soccer Federation's commitment to maintaining equal pay rates for all future tournaments and games. While the multimillion-dollar settlement resolved issues of unequal pay domestically, much of the international issue still resides in the hands of FIFA, the worldwide soccer governing body. FIFA doles out exponentially larger payments for the men's World Cup tournament than the women's, which constitutes the bulk of the pay divide. Honorably, the U.S. men's national team has agreed to both share and surrender millions of dollars in future World Cup FIFA payments in order to maintain equality for the U.S. national soccer teams. The consequences of this settlement have echoed worldwide, inspiring other national teams to push for equality. Ireland, Norway, Australia and the Netherlands are just a few countries that recently have gained national support to close the gender pay gap in soccer.† It is important to note that the multimillion-dollar settlement has not been officially cemented yet. The settlement remains contingent on the ratification of a collective bargaining agreement (or CBA) for the U.S. women's national team and final approval from the court.† In terms of equality between men and women in all sports, this is a small step on a much longer journey. So, while this feat of persistence and strength deserves to be celebrated, the world must continue to strive for better.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Mar. 3, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

In the game, the Gauchos won 18-7, managing 19 hits and 11 walks across the 9 innings.† A couple key contributors in the game included sophomore outfielder Broc Mortensen, junior utility player Christian Kirtley, sophomore infielder Jordan Sprinkle and sophomore infielder Leo Mosby.† Mortensen gathered 4 RBIs with a grand slam in the top of the ninth inning that put the game out of reach, making the score 15-7 following the home run. A draft prospect and the Gauchos' shortstop, Sprinkle managed a productive day at the plate, getting on base 5 out of 6 plate appearances while coming across for 2 runs.† The Gauchos responded to a big-hitting day with a pitching masterpiece en route to a home debut victory 4-1 against Nevada.† Starting pitcher, sophomore Cory Lewis, pitched 6 innings of no-hit baseball while racking up 11 strikeouts and issuing 4 walks.† Although the Gauchos' hitting wasn't as productive, they managed to get timely hits at the right time in the ballgame.† Starting in the second inning, sophomore infielder Nick Oakley's double into right center scored Mortensen, followed by a sacrifice fly to center field to score Oakley.† After a solo home run from the wolfpack in the seventh inning, it was the last runs of the game for them. The Gauchos tacked on another 2 runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, and the game was closed by sophomore right-handed pitcher Ryan Harvey on the mound.† Game 2 against Nevada was a different story for the Gauchos, in which they took the 5-4 come-from-behind loss.† It was a well-pitched starting debut for transfer sophomore left-handed pitcher Mike Gutierrez, going 5 innings, collecting 5 strikeouts and giving up 3 runs, with only 1 being earned.† After the Gauchos gained the lead 2-0 through the first two innings of the game, the wolfpack managed to rally to a 3-2 lead heading into the bottom of the fifth inning.† However, in the bottom of the fifth inning, junior infielder Kyle Johnson hit a solo home run to tie up the game, followed by another RBI single in the seventh inning to make it a 4-3 Gaucho lead.† It was a short-lived lead as Nevada regained the lead in the next half-inning off a 2-RBI single that proved to be enough for the 1-run victory. The players had short memory of the loss, coming out hot en route to their 12-6 series clinching victory versus Nevada in Game 3. Within the first 2 innings, the Gauchos managed to put up a 9-run lead, with Nevada's starting pitcher not making it a full inning.† With the game being 12-2 by the top of the eighth inning, the Gauchos had done enough to hold the game in the latter 2 innings, holding off the wolfpack's 4-run rally to take home the 12-6 victory.† The Gauchos will bounce off this series win to take on the Oregon Ducks at their opponent's field in a 4-game series this upcoming weekend.† A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Mar. 3, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

This was followed by one of the greatest race drivers competing today, Sebastian Vettel, coming out in an interview and saying, ""úI will not go, I think it's wrong to race in that country.""ù Following this, Ukraine's motor racing federation called for the F1 federation to ban all Russian and Belarusian racers from racing.† The biggest international sport in the world, soccer, has been impacted greatly among both international and club organizations. With St. Petersburg set to host the Champions League Final in Russia, the UEFA announced that they would be moving the final to Paris Saint-German's home field in France.† Aeroflot, the Russian national airline, was banned from operating in the United Kingdom, which was a significant step as they were Manchester United's sponsored airline. Likewise, Schalke 04 removed the Russian state-owned oil company Gazprom as their official sponsor.† Roman Abramovich ceded control of the British club Chelsea due to his strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Then, Lokomotiv Moscow manager Markus Gisdol resigned due to what he quoted as, ""úI cannot stand on the training field in Moscow, coaching the players, demanding professionalism, and a couple of kilometers away orders are being issued which bring great suffering to an entire people.""ù FIFA and UEFA decided to then ban Russian national teams jointly from the World Cup qualifying process and all international games. Also, Adidas suspended its kit partnership with the Russian national team.† From the likes of the NBA teams condemning violence against Ukraine, such as the Sacramento Kings and Denver Nuggets uniting for a moment of solidarity before their game, to FC Barcelona and S.S.C. Napoli holding up a banner before their match reading ""úSTOP WAR,""ù there is strong opposition in the sporting world.† Women's tennis star Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova stated, ""úThis is my home and my country. But now I am in complete fear, as are my friends and family. But I am not afraid to clearly state my position. I am against war and violence.""ù Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina also pledged to redistribute her prize money in her next tournaments toward the army and humanitarian needs of Ukraine. Following his win at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev signed the camera with ""úNo war please,""ù insinuating his support for peace, especially as he is a doubles partner with his Ukrainian friend Denys Molchanov. Also, top-ranked Russian player Daniil Medvedev doubled down on pacifism, stating how difficult it is for him to hear the news and insisting he is all for peace.† Former heavyweight boxing champions and brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, both born in Ukraine, chose to bear arms and defend Ukraine's capital Kyiv, of which Vitali Klitschko is the mayor. Current fighter and former lightweight champion Vasiliy Lomachenko followed suit of the brothers, suiting up with a local territorial defense unit near Odessa. In the same way, current heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk joined the Kyiv Territorial Defense while also sending a video toward Putin on Instagram.† Many WNBA players competing in the offseason in Russia and Ukraine are in contact with the league in order to make their way back safely to the United States.† The International Chess Federation ended their ties with Belarus and Russia. In the same sort, the NHL suspended any ties to Russian organizations and business partners and stated they will no longer be looking to play within Russia in the future.† In the midst of a battle happening in their country, Manchester United player Oleksandr Zinchenko and Everton player Vitaliy Mykolenko embraced before their match. This moment should be seen around the world as a reminder that this conflict is bigger than sports and athletes. Ukrainian athletes need support during these trying times.

Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus There is always room to improve and time to turn around the 9-22 start to the season with many conference and out-of-conference games to play for the Gauchos.† On the offensive side of the ball, the Gauchos have been struggling compared to the nation's leading teams. The Gauchos rank 90th in the nation for batting average out of 293 other Division I teams in the nation. Likewise, the .337 on-base percentage of the Gauchos is good enough for 175th in the nation. Then, with 3.84 runs per game, the Gauchos are struggling in the offense department, ranking them 184th. Improving one side of the offense, like baserunning, could be a jumpstart to the Gauchos' offense. With averaging less than 1 stolen base per game, they once again rank in the 200s for stolen bases per game.† On the defensive side of the ball, it doesn't get much better for the Lady Gauchos. The Gauchos rank 148th in the country in fielding percentage which, once again, places the Gauchos in the middle of the pack for the Division I softball schools. The earned run average of the Gauchos' pitchers is a whopping 6.26 which would rank the pitching staff in the top 20 worst earned run averages in the country.† The last and most shocking stat is that UCSB's win percentage is one of the worst in the country at a .290 win percentage, ranking them 246th in the country, just below mid-major schools not known for their sports such as the University of Holy Cross, Sam Houston State University and Columbia University. With that said, there are still many bright spots in the Gauchos' starting lineup. Starting with sophomore infielder Madelyn McNally, who is batting close to .400, McNally is second on the team with 34 hits and leads the team with 9 stolen bases. Leading the team in hits is senior infielder Maci Fines, with 35 hits and a team-leading 17 runs batted in. On the field, senior 1B/outfielder Rayna Cohen and sophomore catcher/utility Ashley Donaldson have been stellar, committing only one error each in the season.† With many players producing at a high level, as mentioned above, it's only a matter of time before the Gauchos string together a nice win streak to end the season.†

UCSB entered the tournament with the second-best odds to win, according to multiple sportsbooks.† Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus On March 10, the Gauchos took on the tournament favorite UC Irvine and won 78-69. However, in the second-to-last day of the five-day tournament, the Gauchos just fell short of a championship title when they lost to No. 1 seed Long Beach State from a buzzer beater shot.† Cal State Fullerton ended up upsetting Long Beach State, advancing Fullerton to the NCAA tournament where they took a loss to the eventual final-four betting favorite Duke University.† Throughout the NCAA tournament, there were many thrilling games, many of which ended in overtime. For instance, there was the play-in game between Rutgers and Notre Dame that turned into double overtime, eventually sending Notre Dame to the round of 64 where they went on to upset Alabama in the first round.† In a year of many upsets happening in this year's NCAA tournament, none was more of a Cinderella run than that of Saint Peter's. Saint Peter's began their tournament against No. 2 Kentucky, who had been one of the pre-tournament betting favorites to win the tournament. They were able to narrowly beat Kentucky, then cruised past No. 7 Murray State into the Sweet 16. Saint Peter's made it to the Elite 8 following another upset victory versus Purdue in a back-and-forth matchup, but lost the following round to No. 8 seed North Carolina.† North Carolina and Duke are not only Atlantic Coast Conference rivals but are each known for their dominance throughout the tournament. These longstanding rivals will be playing each other for the first time in their storied history in the Final Four of the tournament.† No. 8 North Carolina had a particularly difficult route to the Final Four, beginning with a victory over the No. 1-seeded team in the east side of the bracket, Baylor. From there, their Cinderella run continued as they beat a tough No. 4 UCLA team and ended Saint Peter's run in the Elite 8.† North Carolina's matchup opponent, Duke, got to the Final Four with two comfortable margins of victory. One of these was in the first round of the tournament against No. 15 seed Fullerton before they played two thrillers against Texas Tech and Arkansas, with Arkansas having knocked out the 2021 runner-up and No. 1 seed Gonzaga. On the other side of the bracket, the south region was won by Villanova, who didn't have to deal with the No. 1, 3, or 4 seeds. No. 3 seed Tennessee was upset by No. 11 Michigan, No. 4 seed Illinois was upset by Houston, and No. 1 seed Arizona was dominated by No. 5 Houston, who could only muster 44 points in a loss to Villanova.†† The only No. 1 seed to advance to the Final Four came out of the midwest with Kansas. Many upsets occurred in this region, with No. 11 Iowa State beating Louisiana State and Wisconsin† and No. 10 Miami winning upset victories against the University of Southern California and No. 2 Auburn. Miami and Iowa State then faced off, with Miami prevailing and moving on to face Kansas in the Elite 8. Kansas needed two straight comeback victories to move into the Elite 8 and Final Four, with Kansas's second half versus Miami resulting in a blowout 26-point victory for them.†† In the final run of the legendary Coach Mike Krzyzewski, more commonly known as Coach K, he has a chance to end it with a bang against rival North Carolina. On top of that, if Kansas and Duke were to win in the Final Four, it would line up Coach K to beat Kansas, the team he had beat en route to his first NCAA tournament championship.†

The main meet on March 11, the UCSB Invite, hosted teams from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine, while the multis competition, lasting from March 9-10, attracted athletes from as far as Maine.† Nexus File Photo The Gauchos took first place in both multi events, with junior Jessica Swalve finishing on top for the women's heptathlon with a personal best score of 4940 points and junior Matthew Molina winning the men's decathlon with 6746 points. The multis are two of the most grueling events in all of track and field. Over the span of two days, the female multis compete in seven events (the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, the 200-meter dash, long jump, javelin and the 800 meters) while the men compete in 10 events (the 100-meter dash, discus, pole vault, the 110-meter hurdles, the 400-meter dash, shot put, long jump, high jump, javelin and the 1500 meters).† Scoring in the heptathlon and decathlon is notoriously confusing. While the athletes compete against each other, placing in individual events does not affect their score; instead, scores are calculated using performance tables that are based on the world record of each event. So, while one athlete could win four events out of seven, the athlete who places second in six events might win overall. In the multis, it pays to be average across the board rather than stellar in one or two events. Swalve took first in three events: shot put, where she threw a personal best of 12.34 meters; high jump, with a jump of 1.58 meters; and javelin, with a throw of 38.48 meters. She also jumped a personal best in long jump with a mark of 5.21 meters. Sophomore Sofia Bailey also did well in the heptathlon, placing second overall with a score of 4603 points. Bailey also earned personal bests in the shot put and high jump, and took first place in the 800 meters with a time of 2:23.90. In the decathlon, Molina also took first in three events: the 110 meters hurdles, with a time of 15.22 seconds; long jump, with a mark of 7.09 meters; and the 1500 meters, with a personal best of 4:35.27. Senior Peter Michiels placed third overall in the decathlon with a compiled score of 6619 points, followed closely by senior Joshua Godfrey and freshman Brad Thomas in fourth and fifth, respectively. Assistant Coach Hope Bender, who works closely with the heptathletes and decathletes,† commented on their performance, saying, ""úThe whole group did an awesome job staying focused and competing hard for two days, and we were rewarded with PRs left and right.""ù Bender herself is a UCSB track and field alum who recently placed ninth at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials in the heptathlon. Under the lights on Friday night, the rest of the UCSB track team competed to win. Though the meet wasn't scored overall, UCSB had a strong showing in almost every event. Standouts for the distance team include senior Brian Schulz, whose 13:59.46 5000-meter run took second place by just 1.24 seconds to Cal Poly's Xian Shively. Schulz's impressive mark now stands as the third-best 5000-meter time in Gaucho history. Senior Nick Randazzo took first place in the 3000-meter steeplechase with a strong opening time of 9:04.22.† In the sprints, junior Brendan Fong ran a collegiate best of 48.65 in the 400 meters to place first. In the throws, senior Gabby Sanchez threw a personal best in the hammer throw, with a mark of 52.80 meters that earned her second place. Junior Amanda Spear followed closely in third place with another personal best throw of 51.33 meters. Sanchez also placed second in the discus and shot put.† Even better results are promised ahead. ""úOur team as a whole had two great early season meets ""î at Long Beach State and at home ""î and now we're taking our focus forward into the bulk of our regular season, taking a week off and then competing the next four weeks in a row. Our athletes will really start to hit their stride, and we're expecting to see Big West Conference and regional qualifiers coming out of almost every meet we do,""ù Bender said.

Croatia is the World Cup runner-up and Canada surprisingly finished top of the CONCACAF, so there will be a battle in this group.† The No. 1 team in the world features Brazil headlining Group G, competing with No. 14 Switzerland, No. 25 Serbia and No. 37 Cameroon. Brazil is the easy favorite with players like forwards Neymar and Vin√≠cius J√∫nior in attack, while Switzerland should not be overlooked with World Cup veterans like forward Breel Embolo and midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri.† Last but not least, Group H features one of the biggest stars in the world, forward Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal. They will be accompanied by Ghana, No. 13 Uruguay and South Korea. No. 8 Portugal barely scraped by to make the World Cup but should be the favorite with star players like Ronaldo and midfielder Bruno Fernandes. Uruguay will be right on their tail with youngsters like midfielders Federico Valverde and Lucas Torreira.† Overall, the betting favorites in Vegas include Brazil and France who are the No. 1 in the world and the defending World Cup champion, respectively.

The Gauchos are currently placed second in the Big West. Pepperdine is now 22-19 overall and 12-6 in conference.† ""ú[Last weekend] was a big weekend for us,""ù Head Coach Andrew Checketts said. ""úIt was a tough weekend, and there were a lot of close games. It was competitive, but it was a big series win.""ù† Last time the two teams faced early this season, UCSB pulled out a 6-4 win over the Waves. For the past two seasons, UCSB has split a pair of games with Pepperdine.† This week, junior righty and utility player Robby Nesovic was named Big West Field Player of the Week due to his performance in the series against Cal Poly. Nesovic, who has topped the conference batting average rankings all season, went 8-12 last week and recorded five RBIs. Nesovic now holds the leading record for RBIs in the conference with 34.† A handful of other Gaucho players also fill the top-spots on the Big West leaderboards in addition to Nesovic. Junior righty Dillon Tate still holds the second seed in the conference for overall earned run average behind Big West Pitcher of the Week, freshman Chris Mathewson of Long Beach.† Though Tate did not appear in the series against Cal Poly, the rest of UCSB's No. 3 pitching staff picked up the task. Tate is scheduled to appear in next weekend's away series against Hawaii.† ""úI think that [today's game] is going to be competitive,""ù Checketts said. ""úDillon Tate being off the mound, we moved our Tuesday starter to start yesterday, so we're throwing some guys that don't have as much experience tomorrow,""ù Checketts said.† The UCSB lineup has put up 209 runs so far this season and has a collective .296 batting average. In addition, the Gauchos have maintained a .384 batting average, leading the conference. The Gauchos also lead the league in team batting average.† Stand out hitter for UCSB continues to be redshirt senior outfielder Luke Swenson who has only struck out 10 times this season and maintains a .352 batting average. Sophomore outfielder and leadoff hitter Andrew Calica holds the highest OBP for the Gauchos at .456 making it onto the base path almost half of the time he visits the plate.† ""úWell we have practice today, and Pepperdine has played us tough. We've split with them the past couple years and we won a close one down there this season,""ù Checketts said. ""úI know they're playing well right now, but we're trying to take that momentum and use it to progress and get better every day.""ù† In the lineup for Pepperdine, freshman righty and outfielder Jordan Qsar leads his team with a .313 batting average. Junior infielder Hutton Moyer is another standout Pepperdine batter, as he currently holds a .510 slugging percentage and has recorded 26 RBIs this season.† Of the three starters for the Waves, junior righty Jackson McClelland leads the defensive charge with a 1.70 ERA in 69 innings pitched and 49 strikeouts.† Today's midweek game will lead into a three-game away trip for the Gauchos to face the Big West's Hawaii in a conference series starting Friday.

On the other hand, UCSB was able to beat No. 2 Pepperdine and No. 11 UC San Diego, and bested No. 9 Grand Canyon and No. 13 BYU twice.† To begin the month of March, UCSB continued their hot form and started the month with four straight matches, beating their opponents in straight sets. Two of these opened up their first league series, in which they beat Cal State Northridge in each contest. UCSB's first blip in their recent run of play came against Long Beach State, as they lost the first match 1-3 and the second match 0-3. The most recent conference series, however, fell the way of the Gauchos, as they beat UC Irvine 3-1 and won the second match in 3 straight sets.† On the season, the Gauchos improved their overall record to 16-6 and 5-2 in conference play, putting them in second place behind the only team they've lost to in conference, Long Beach State.† In a conference separated by 2 games between first and third place, the Gauchos can continue to improve in a multitude of areas. For instance, the Gauchos rank third in hitting percentage at .298, trailing Long Beach State and fourth-place Hawai'i. On the other hand, in the other offensive categories, the Gauchos rank in the bottom half of the conference, ranking fourth in assists and fifth in kills-per-match. The service aces are the one area where the team excels, ranking second to Hawai'i.† The defense of the Gauchos is an area where they can easily improve, as they are not ranking in the top two in the categories of opponent digs, opponent blocks, opponent kills, opponent assists and opponent hitting percentage. The area they excel in once again relates to the beginning of the play with opponent serve aces ranking the Gauchos second in the conference.† The Gauchos are in a prime position to finish the season strong and will need to continue their craft of solid offense, but clean it up on the offensive end.†  A version of this article appeared on p. 9 of the Apr. 7, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

With the 3 wins, the Gauchos now have a conference record of 10-2 which is good enough for first overall in the Big West. The overall record for the team currently stands at 21-8.† Armani Smith scoops up a ground ball. Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus With his strong play in the series, freshman right-handed pitcher Ryan Gallagher was named Big West Pitcher of the Week. In his lone start of the series and the final one overall, Gallagher pitched 8 innings, a career-high, and gave up 1 run in the 7-1 victory. Gallagher also allowed 4 hits and 4 walks in addition to striking out 5 batters.† The 7-1 victory was not very close, but the previous 2 games between the Gauchos and Matadors were. In the first game of the series, both offenses were firing on all cylinders. The teams combined for 6 home runs and 22 RBIs in the 13-10 UCSB victory. Cal State Northridge (CSUN) opened up an early lead as they were up 2-0 after the second inning. Immediately after, the Gauchos tied the game up at 2 runs apiece. After this, the game went back-and-forth with the Matadors leading by up to 3 runs. With the score tied at 8-8, the Gauchos exploded for 4 runs in the eighth inning. CSUN was only able to score 2 more runs in the rest of the game, with the Gauchos taking the opening game of the series.† The next day saw another contested matchup with a 2-run game. This time, it was UCSB who jumped out to an early lead. Before the Matadors could score a run, UCSB had already built a 7-0 advantage. For the rest of the game, the Matadors chipped away at the lead as UCSB scored 2 more runs the rest of the way. After the Gauchos acquired their 7-0 lead, CSUN went on a 7-2 run and had a chance to tie it or win it in the ninth inning. However, the Matadors were unable to score as UCSB took the second game of the series with a 9-7 victory. Only 2 home runs were hit in this matchup, but both teams were able to make good contact with the ball as both teams combined for 10 doubles. With a 3-game winning streak in hand, the Gauchos will look to continue their winning ways in their next series. UCSB will return to Santa Barbara for 7 straight home games starting on Thursday. The Gauchos will first have a 3-game series with UC San Diego and will then play a single game against UCLA. To end the homestand, UCSB will partake in a 3-game series against Long Beach State.† A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the Apr. 14, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The NBA has since adapted to keep the Play-In Tournament to decide the seventh and eighth seeds for each conference.† In the Eastern Conference, the ninth-seeded Hawks will host the 10-seed Hornets, and the Pelicans will host the Spurs in the Western Conference. The winner of the Eastern Conference, ninth- and 10th-seeded games, will go on to play the loser of the Cavaliers versus Nets game, while the winner of the Cavs versus Nets gets the seventh seed in the playoffs. Likewise, the winner of the Spurs versus Pelicans will go on to play the loser of the Clippers against the Timberwolves, with the winner of the Clippers and Timberwolves getting the seventh seed in the West.† Starting in the East, the No. 1 seed heading into the playoffs is the Miami Heat, featuring a multitude of solid veteran players. The team is backed by the superstar duo of center Bam Adebayo and forward Jimmy Butler, but also gets scoring from the favorite to win sixth man of the year, point guard Tyler Herro. The second-seeded Celtics are led by the young duo of emerging stars in the NBA with forward Jayson Tatum and guard Jaylen Brown.† Moving on to the No.3 seed, the defending champion Bucks are led by former MVP forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and multiple-time all-star guard Khris Middleton. With the same record as the Bucks and Celtics, the 76ers managed to slip to the No.4 seed, backed by MVP favorite center Joel Embiid and former MVP guard James Harden, whom they acquired from the Nets.† The Raptors are an enticing young squad who feature a multitude of position-less players like forward Pascal Siakam, forward Scottie Barnes and forward OG Anunoby. With a late season fallout mixed with a variety of injuries, the Bulls take the No. 6 seed into the playoffs, featuring the above-the-rim phenom, Zach LaVine, and the mid-range specialist, DeMar DeRozan, as their guards.† The Western Conference No.1 seed, the Suns, are the NBA champion runner-up, falling short to the Bucks, but are nonetheless atop the Western Conference again. The Grizzlies are the No.2 seed in the West, backed by young superstar guard Ja Morant, who is in the running for the NBA's Most Improved Award.† The No.3 seed Golden State Warriors were hot to begin the season, but without Stephen Curry, the team went cold. They will have to rely on the hot stretch guard Klay Thompson, who has been on since coming back from an injury. The fourth-seeded Dallas Mavericks will be at a disadvantage to start the postseason as superstar guard Luka Donƒçiƒá will be out for the foreseeable future while rehabbing an injury.† The last two playoff teams with a spot in the West are the fifth-seeded Utah Jazz and the sixth-seeded Denver Nuggets. The Jazz have put together a solid squad behind former defensive player of the year, center Rudy Gobert, and all-star guard Donovan Mitchell. On the other hand, it has been a one-man show for the Denver Nuggets, with center and MVP candidate Nikola Jokiƒá leading a one-man show in Denver without the injured guard Jamal Murray and guard Kevin Porter Jr. All in all, this playoff will feature some of the younger superstars in the higher seeds like Morant on the Grizzlies, Devin Booker on the Suns and Tatum leading the Celtics to the No. 2 seed.†† A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the Apr. 14, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Beginning with their rough month of April, the Gauchos won 3 games but lost 5 games along the way.† Nexus File Photo To start the month of February, the Gauchos, ranked No. 16 at the time, lost a tough matchup 4-10 against the No. 1 University of Southern California Trojans in the first match of the Triton Invitational. It didn't get better for the squad as they took on conference opponent Long Beach State in an out-of-conference matchup, losing to a tune of 8-11.† The Gauchos were able to turn it around shortly, beating Cal State Northridge 17-9 and extending the winning streak to 2 games by beating No. 20 Loyola Marymount University 12-11. Their stretch of wins came to an end during the beginning of the Barbara Kalbus Invitational, losing to their in-conference rival UC Irvine 9-13.† Following the loss to UC Irvine, they bounced back in the tournament by beating the No. 21 San Diego State University in a close 11-10 victory. This would be one of UCSB's last victories in their recent run of games. They followed up that victory with 2 losses to end the Barbara Kalbus Invitational. The first loss came against No. 9 Arizona State University, in which they were outmatched to an 8-17 result. Then, the Gauchos couldn't come out on the winning end of an overtime thriller against No. 11 UC San Diego in the final match of the tournament.† Going into conference play, the Gauchos were up against No. 6 UC Irvine, while the Gauchos were ranked No. 16. This game was a one-way affair with Irvine dominating the game, winning 16-8. In the next away-conference game, the Gauchos had another rematch against Cal State Northridge, beating them 10-7. To finish the month of March, the Gauchos were handily defeated by the No. 5University of Hawai'i by a score of 16-5.† April started in a similar fashion for the Gauchos, as they lost a closely contested match to the conference foe, No. 11 Long Beach State 9-14.

After winning the 1st set by 4 points, the Gauchos dropped the 2nd set before taking the next 2 sets and winning the match.  In the match, there were a plethora of standout performers both offensively and defensively. On the offensive side, sophomore outside hitter Dayne Chalmers and junior outside hitter Ryan Wilcox led the way for the Gauchos, each getting 13 kills in the match. On defense, the Gauchos were led in the block department by sophomore middle blocker Donovan Todorov, who led the team with 8 blocks. With an overall standout game, junior opposite hitter Haotian Xia provided the team with 9 kills and 5 blocks.† As the season comes to a close, UCSB is in a prime position to make a run at the national championship in Division I men's volleyball. Similarly, Hawai'i was the winner of the Big West Conference last season, and they ended up winning the national championship. The Gauchos had been a game away from the national championship before Hawai'i ended their run to the finals in the semifinals that season.† By the numbers, Hawai'i put up a dominant shortened season during their 2021 run to their first-place finish. They finished their season 17-1, going a whopping 10-0 in league play. UCSB, on the other hand, is 6-4 in league play, but still has an impressive 18-8 overall record, hence being ranked No. 6 in the country. In the 26 matches for UCSB, they have put up some impressive numbers, averaging 11.91 kills per set, a .297 hitting percentage and 11.26 assists per set. The Hawai'i team that won it all in 2021 averaged 13.7 kills per set, 12.6 assists per set and had a .360 hitting percentage. Although the Gauchos have less in the stats department, it can be attributed to their longer schedule and level of competition in the Big West this season. Among their competitors included the talented Long Beach State team; defending national champion Hawai'i; and UC San Diego, who is ranked in the top 10 in the country.† Although the core for the Gauchos remained the same for them, the result against Hawai'i this season was no different than 2021, with Hawai'i beating the Gauchos 3-0 and 3-2 in conference play this season.† In the closer 3-2 conference game against Hawai'i, the Gauchos had multiple areas where a subtle adjustment could've been the difference. First of all, the kill percentage was in favor of the opponent with a .387 percentage, with the Gauchos being .315. On the defensive side, the most standout statistic was that the 8 blocks of the Gauchos were doubled by Hawai'i getting 16 blocks in the match. With the Big West tournament on the horizon, it is important the Gauchos stay on the same path with minor adjustments because their games against Hawai'i show they can compete with the best in the country.† A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the Apr. 21, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The Gauchos, already coming off of a three-game win streak on the road against the Cal State Northridge Matadors, were looking to continue the trajectory of success here at home. With a sizable audience each day, the fans were rewarded with a Gaucho win each game of the series.  The Thursday opener started off a little shaky. By the 2nd inning, the Tritons had the bases loaded and were already back to the start of the batting order. By the next inning, the Tritons' senior catcher Blake FitzGerald knocked out a 2-run homer, and San Diego took the lead. This early lead boosted the confidence in the Tritons' dugout and cast a pall of silence over the stands. This didn't last for too long though, as the Gauchos took a 3-2 lead by the end of the 4th inning. And even when the lead went back to the Tritons briefly, the Gauchos had an explosive 5th inning. When the score was tied at 4-4, sophomore outfielder Broc Mortensen knocked a 3-run dinger all the way out of the park. Mortensen ""ì a transfer who used to be a running back for Cal Poly's football team ""ì has already hit 9 home runs this season and has a slugging percentage nearing .600. Once the Gauchos got this boost of confidence, the lead remained firm, and the boys brought home a 10-6 win by the end of the night. Friday provided more excitement and 10 more runs by the home team. Just as in the last game, the Tritons took an early lead in the 2nd inning, but this was interrupted with 3 straight scoring innings for the Gauchos from the 4th to the 6th. In fact, in the bottom of the 5th, the Gauchos scored 6 runs by routinely keeping the bases loaded, scoring a series of RBIs. Luckily, the Gauchos' offensive success was aided by a strong pitching performance by sophomore Nick Welch, who earned the win ""ì his first in the conference ""ì with 8 strikeouts in a mere 4 innings. Finally, the afternoon game on Saturday provided the most thrilling feat of the whole series. The Tritons, hoping to recalibrate after losing in 2 straight near-blowouts, put up a good fight ""î with the final score being a nail-biting 8-7 in favor of the Gauchos. In what was a back-and-forth slugfest between the two opponents, UCSB took an early 3-0 lead, which was quickly matched by the Tritons. Although UCSB never gave up their lead, it was not an uncommon sight to see both teams tied up at the end of an inning. At the end of the day, the batting lineup came to the rescue for the Gauchos and aided them in sweeping the series. Every batter on the lineup made at least one base hit; 5 batters earned an RBI, and three Gauchos hit a home run. By the time the bottom of the 8th came around, it looked as if extra innings was not an impossibility ""î as the score was 6-6. But when junior infielder Kyle Johnson hit an RBI single to right field, sending both junior utility player Christian Kirtley and senior fielder Jason Willow home, the Gauchos clinched the win. The Tritons scored in the top of the 9th, hoping to force a Gauchos at-bat, but with 2 outs when the run was scored, it was too late. The Gauchos secured the hard-fought win and swept the series ""î setting them up well for their upcoming home series against UCLA.

As both UCSB and Cal Poly were heading into this game 2-0, its stakes were high.† A win on Saturday meant first place in the Western Collegiate Lacrosse League (WSLL) Southern Division, but unfortunately the Gauchos could not get the job done. Despite this, there were good signs for the games to come, as UCSB was able to win the ground ball battle against Cal Poly 47-42 and freshman goalkeeper Kevin Shvodian† turned in a solid outing with a save percentage of 51.6%.† Injury troubles have weakened the UCSB roster, particularly the defense. Freshman Zen Chang and senior Alex Gregory, two strong defenders, have been forced to miss time. Sophomore midfielder Patrick Gough noted that these injuries have taken a toll on the team, including against Cal Poly.† ""úIt's been difficult with injuries, with our defense especially being hit hard, but we have had some great players step up in positions they had never played before to make up [for it],""ù Gough said. ""úIt's been hard getting used to having some of our key starters missing.""ù Despite the losses to their roster, as well as to Cal Poly, the Gauchos secured second place in the division, giving them a berth in the WSLL Division I tournament. Their first game will be against the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) on Saturday, April 23, and optimism is running high. ""úThe main goal is to win it all and advance to the national championship ""¶ when we have all our cylinders firing and everything coming together, there isn't a single team in the MCLA that we can't beat,""ù Gough said. The WSLL tournament consists of three rounds; if the Gauchos can handle UNR, they will play University of California, Berkeley, who they narrowly lost to in their season opener, 14-16. If the Gauchos can even the score there, they play the winner of Cal Poly vs. Santa Clara University/Dominican University in the WSLL finals. A win there will secure a trip to the national tournament held in Round Rock, Texas. A version of this article appeared on p. 11 of the Apr. 21, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,The Impacts of Baseball's Turn to Analytics at All Levels: An Era of Efficiency,26-Apr-22,11:43 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-26/the-impacts-of-baseballs-turn-to-analytics-at-all-levels-an-era-of-efficiency/,"In an era that is increasingly turning toward technology and understanding how to be more efficient in everyday life, sabermetrics and analytics have taken the forefront in sports ""î specifically in baseball. The new era of front office scouts and general managers is seeing a movement toward using ""únew""ù stats that more efficiently help players succeed. In the game of baseball, stealing bases, hitting the ball on the ground, bunting the ball and hitting for a high average used to be a priority, but these means of assessing baseball performance are now being phased out. Similarly, some of the older stats that are also being phased out are batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, earned run average and pitcher's record. So, this raises the question: Why are these stats that were used for so long being phased out? Simple, many of these stats are too reliant on their teams, home stadiums and weather conditions. One of the new stats now being used is Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA). Instead of giving base percentage, batting average and slugging percentage as separate stats, wOBA combines them all into one for an efficient depiction. Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) is another new and particularly interesting analytic stat because it removes the home runs and strikeouts from the batting average, showing the pure batting averages of players' swings that are put at the hands of the defense. The stat Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) is similar to BABIP in a sense that it takes away the ""úluck""ù that occurs in baseball. As an example, the Philadelphia Phillies had a terrible defense in 2021, so Phillies pitcher Zack Wheeler's 2.78 earned run average was actually inflated, as shown by his 2.59 FIP. Tracking how ""úunlucky""ù or ""úlucky""ù a hitter was depends on the exit velocity and launch angle of the ball off the bat. So, if a ball was to be hit above 95 miles per hour with a 25-degree launch angle but resulted in a line drive-out, it would be added to the batter's wOBA because most balls with those numbers are likely resulting in a hit. A key player to look at during the beginning of this year's MLB season is New York Yankees outfielder Joey Gallo. Using older stats, many people would argue he is having a terrible season with a .146 batting average and .167 slugging percentage. However, his wOBA is .210, and even better, his expected wOBA is .327, which means that he has been hitting the ball great but has been getting a little unlucky. The start of this era of improved sabermetrics and analytics can be traced back to the '80s of baseball, but it only took the forefront of sports when the film ""úMoneyball""ù hit the theaters in 2011. The film described how general manager Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics were able to overcome one of the lowest payrolls in baseball by focusing on spending money on analytically efficient players. In that case, the Oakland Athletics developed a way to reach the playoffs while looking at the deeper numbers, not the surface stats, of a player. With the rise of analytics in baseball, you see more and more often how big-power hitters are batting and pitchers are throwing harder than ever before. Analytics have even shifted the front offices as there now aren't many members of front office staff who don't have mathematical backgrounds. The President of Baseball Operations for the San Francisco Giants, Farhan Zaidi, is a key example as he received his doctoral degree in economics from UC Berkeley. Understanding the shift to a modern, technological approach to baseball will help the average viewer understand why certain players are outperforming others. Also, as colleges and competitive high schools develop their own analytic programs, understanding it at the major league level will make it applicable to all levels.

Just recently, the Gauchos completed a 3-game sweep of the Long Beach State Dirtbags and improved their record to 27-9 in the process. Currently, UCSB's conference record is a spectacular 16-2.†  After snapping their 6-game winning streak in a 4-14 loss to the No. 14 UC Los Angeles Bruins, the Gauchos stayed in Santa Barbara to begin their series against Long Beach. UCSB set the tone of the series immediately with a dominant showing. After a scoreless first inning for both teams, the Gauchos took advantage of their potent offense and their opponent's mistakes to jump out to a 6-0 lead. UCSB hit 2 triples in the inning and a bases-clearing double to begin their blowout. As the game continued, Long Beach struggled to get any offensive momentum, as Gaucho pitcher Cory Lewis was perfect through 5 innings. Before Long Beach could get a single runner on base, UCSB tacked on 3 more runs in the fourth inning. The Dirtbags scored their only runs in the fifth inning as they broke up Lewis' perfect game. However, UCSB did not let up and cruised to an opening victory of 14-2. The second game of the series was an outlier, as it was a low-scoring matchup and closely contested throughout. Again, it was UCSB who struck first, as they scored 2 runs in the third inning via the first home run of John Newman Jr.'s career and another solo homer from Blake Klassen. The next 3 innings were scoreless for both teams as Long Beach attempted to chip away at the lead. It was the Dirtbags who ended the scoring drought with a 2-run inning in the seventh. The tied game only lasted for a few outs as the Gauchos drove in the go-ahead run in the bottom of the seventh inning with an RBI single from Bryce Willits. This 3-2 scoreline would end up being the final score as the Gauchos ended the day with their second win of the series.† In the final game of the series, the Gauchos went back to their domination of Long Beach. Again, UCSB jumped out to a large lead early in the game with a 5-run second inning. In the inning, every run was scored with 2 outs and Klassen hit a 2-run home run to extend the lead to 5-0. After quickly retiring the Dirtbags in the top of the third inning, the Gauchos scored 2 more runs to make it a 7-0 game. In this inning, Nick Vogt hit a solo home run. For the rest of the game, the Gauchos scored 3 more runs, and Long Beach scored their lone run of the day in the final inning of the game. The final score was 10-1 as UCSB completed the sweep and secured a 3-game winning streak. On Tuesday, the Gauchos will take on the USC Trojans in Los Angeles. Afterward, they will travel to San Luis Obispo for the weekend to continue conference play against the Cal Poly Mustangs. The stakes will be high as the Mustangs look to dethrone UCSB from first place in the Big West A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the Apr. 28, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Women's Tennis Dominates the Month of April With Undefeated Big West Play,26-Apr-22,11:33 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-04-26/womens-tennis-dominates-the-month-of-april-with-undefeated-big-west-play/,"During the month of April, the Gauchos were scorching hot, beating all their opponents by at least 3 points and going undefeated throughout league play. As the Big West Tournament comes around this week on April 28, the Gauchos will have experience on their side. The women's tennis team has won the regular season championship for the fourth consecutive season, were the conference tournament champions the year prior in 2021 and have won 3 of the last 5 conference tournaments.  Coming into their last regular season game against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, each team was undefeated in conference play, hence setting up a showdown of the undefeated teams. In the first doubles match, the No. 25- ranked Gauchos took a victory with sophomore Shakhnoza Khatamova and graduate Elizaveta Volodko, beating the Cal Poly duo 6-4. Then, in the second doubles match, the Gauchos continued the winning momentum with freshman Amelia Honer and junior Kira Reuter beating their duo 6-3. In the singles matches, the Gauchos got off to a cold start, losing the first singles match in 3 sets, then followed this with a straight-sets loss in the second match. Following the opening 2 singles losses, sophomore Camille Kiss put a halt to the losses, beating her opponent in 3 sets. Honer continued the success of Kiss with a straight-set victory, allowing her opponent to win just 3 games in the 2 sets. Another victory came at the hands of the Gauchos in Match 5 with Filippa Bruu-Syversen, who beat her opponent in 2 straight sets. The UCSB women's team ended up splitting the singles matches ""î dropping Match 6 ""î but still managed to win 4-1 due to their doubles results. Looking forward to their next match, the Gauchos will have to wait a bit as they will get a first- round bye in the conference tournament being the No. 1 overall seed in the conference. Their first match of the tournament, will come versus either No. 9 UC Irvine or No. 10 UC Riverside. The Gauchos handled each of these potential opponents fairly easily during the regular season, beating UC Riverside 4-0 and UC Irvine 6-1. The Gauchos will be the overwhelming favorite coming into Big West tournament play, having gone undefeated in conference play and Big West tournament play in 2021. If the Gauchos go undefeated in the conference tournament, it would be 2 straight seasons of perfection against their Big West foes. The Gauchos are also following a standout performance from their previous tournament run, not allowing a single point in their 3 matches, and are looking to repeat that feat for the third time since the 2008 season.

sports,Dramatic Championship Weekend for Gauchos' Tennis,5-May-22,8:58 AM,"[""Gabriel O'Brien""]",https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-05/dramatic-championship-weekend-for-gauchos-tennis/,"This weekend at the Barnes Tennis Center in San Diego, the red-hot Gauchos' women's and men's tennis teams made the school proud when both teams advanced to the Big West Tournament Championships, and one earned a guaranteed spot in the NCAA Tournament. Both teams continued win streaks that have earned them top-seeded status this season and have made them both formidable opponents for any of the other teams unlucky enough to go head to head with them. Nexus File Photo On Friday, the women's tennis team faced Cal State Fullerton, in which they shut out the Titans 4-1. In almost every single doubles and singles match, the ladies pulled out a victory ""î often by large margins. In the singles events, there were 3 straight-set wins. And within the singles category, two athletes ""î freshman Amelia Honer and sophomore Camille Kiss ""î continued impressive win streaks of their own. Honer, who played in the Junior US Open and was the 2021 National Clay Court Champion, achieved a 10-match winning streak. And Kiss, the Big West Team Champion and last year's Big West Freshman of the Year, won her 6th consecutive singles win. Overall, the ladies tennis team achieved ten straight victories in the Big West, in which they remain undefeated, and are aiming to continue this trajectory of success. On the day of the championship on Saturday, the ladies were sure to pull out a win, to bring the Gauchos their second title in a row and their tenth all time. The score at the end of the tournament was 4-1 against the Cal Poly Mustangs. Notable performances on Saturday included the doubles teams of Honer and Kira Reuter, graduate student Elizaveta Volodko and senior Shakhnoza Khatamova, and juniors Marta Gonzalez Ballbe and Kiss. The doubles teams swept all their matches within the meeting with the Mustangs. Nearly every Gaucho in the singles category earned a victory as well. Arguably, the most impressive victory belonged to freshman Filippa Bruu-Syversen, who won her match 6-1, 6-0 in a dominant victory. Congratulations are in order, as this clinched the women's team a spot in the NCAA Division I championship, where, on May 2, their first competitor will be announced. On Saturday, the men's tennis team faced off against the University of Hawai""òi Rainbow Warriors. This was the one match that stood in the way of the Gauchos' men's team reaching the Big West Tournament and was also a grudge match against the one team that defeated the Gauchos this season within the Big West conference. But in the end, the No. 1 seed Gauchos won 4 matches to 1 against Hawaii, and the clinching victory came from sophomore Phillip Jordan when he defeated Hawai""òi's Andre Ilagan in a come-from-behind victory to put the Gauchos in the finals. However, in the championship on Sunday, against the UC Irvine Anteaters, the Gauchos' men's team came up just short of being Big West Champions for the seventh consecutive year. However, the unfortunate loss did not come without some edge-of-your-seat thrills. The Gauchos led early on 2 matches to 1, but the Anteaters rallied in the latter half of the meeting with UC Santa Barbara as the Gauchos eventually fell 4 matches to 2. Still, the teams of sophomores Phillip Jordan and Kai Brady, as well as senior Stefano Tsorotiotis and freshman Gianluca Brunkow, were able to pull out wins in the doubles category; and Brunkow and sophomore Pablo Masjuan took home the wins in the singles category. Nevertheless, not all hope is lost for the men's tennis squad, as they hope for an at-large bid to compete in the upcoming NCAA Division I men's tennis bracket selection show this Monday, which decides the competitions for the NCAA tournament.

The sweep has more distance between the Gauchos and the rest of the Big West with 6 games now separating UCSB and the next closest team, the Hawai""òi Rainbow Warriors.† Angie Banks/Daily Nexus The Gauchos traveled to San Luis Obispo days after a 13-7 defeat to USC. The two conference rivals were neck to neck and a Cal Poly series win could have changed the momentum for the rest of the season. With this context in the mind of both teams, the first game of the series was a contested one. At first, it seemed as if the Gauchos were going to continue their season-long dominance as it was a 3-0 game by the end of the 2nd inning. However, the Gaucho bats went quiet after the inning, until the Mustangs had a 3-run inning of their own. UCSB quickly struck back in the top of the 7th with a solo home run courtesy of senior catcher Gianni Bloom. Again, Cal Poly tied the game in the next inning, and things stood at 4 runs apiece going into the 9th. Both offenses began to explode as an RBI triple from Bloom and a 2-run shot by junior infielder Blake Klassen put UCSB up 7-4. However, the Gauchos played a sloppy bottom of the 9th, as 2 errors led the Mustangs to a 3-run game-tying inning. The Gauchos scored the final runs of the game in the 11th inning by scoring 3 runs via another home run by Klassen and a sophomore infielder Nick Oakley double. With these runs, UCSB set the tone for the series with a 10-7 extra-inning victory. The next day, the game was not as competitive. After scoring a single run in each of the first 3 innings, Cal Poly's offense sputtered as UCSB began to take over. The Gauchos quickly cut down the lead with a 2-run 4th inning with RBIs from senior outfielder Jason Willow and Oakley. Then, UCSB's best inning of the game came in the 6th, as the Gauchos took the lead for good with 2 RBIs from sophomore infield Jordan Sprinkle and an RBI single from redshirt junior infielder Bryce Willits. UCSB refused to take their feet off the pedal as they scored 3 runs in the final inning to make the final score 8-3. With the victory, the Gauchos created more separation between the two teams as Hawai""òi was able to leapfrog the Mustangs in the standings.† The final game was similar to the second, as UCSB blew out Cal Poly to close out the series. Again, the Mustangs were the first to score as they tacked on a single run in the 1st inning. However, UCSB was able to strike back immediately with a run of their own in the top of the 2nd. After another single-run inning by Cal Poly, the offense went quiet for both sides until the 7th inning. From the 7th inning to the 9th, the Gauchos scored 6 runs against the Mustangs' 1 to put the game away. The 7-3 UCSB victory secured the series sweep for the Gauchos and put them in the driver's seat for first place in the Big West. The Gauchos will look to keep their winning streak alive with a single home game against Pepperdine University and then will travel to Orange County to take on the UC Irvine Anteaters in hopes of strengthening their conference record.† A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the May 5, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

In the midst of these notable absences, the first round of the playoffs still featured the young stars like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jayson Tatum and Ja Morant.†  In the Western Conference matchup of the 1-seed Phoenix Suns versus the 8-seed New Orleans Pelicans, it saw the Suns taking the 4-2 series win behind the dominance of the pick-and-roll game of Chris Paul, with star guard Devin Booker being injured for a majority of the series.† In the matchup of the 5-seed Utah Jazz and the 4-seed Dallas Mavericks, it also came down to a 6-game series, with the Mavericks prevailing. The Mavericks, like the Suns, were met with the injury bug as their star point guard Luka Donƒçiƒá was out the first couple of games in which backup point guard Jalen Brunson carried the load. This may end the regime of Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell as many point to sources saying the two have not meshed and will be looking to separate.† The 3-seed Golden State Warriors beat the Denver Nuggets in 5 games behind a quality team series. The Nuggets MVP center Nikola Jokiƒá was not enough to overcome the firepower from Klay Thompson, Jordan Poole, Draymond Green and Stephen Curry.† The final Western Conference series had the 2-seed Memphis Grizzlies beating the 7-seed Minnesota Timberwolves in a 6-game series. The Grizzlies were led by the duo of young guards Ja Morant and Desmond Bane, while the Timberwolves stayed close in the series behind Karl-Anthony Towns, D'angelo Russell and Anthony Edwards.† The Eastern Conference had more lopsided series in the first round of the playoffs. Starting with Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo on the 1-seed Miami Heat beating the 8-seed Atlanta Hawks, which featured a struggling Trae Young in the series.† The 4-seed Philadelphia 76ers beat the 5-seed Toronto Raptors in the longest series in the East, which went 6 games. Although the Raptors fell short, it was a great experience for their young core of Scottie Barnes, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr. and OG Anunoby. On the other hand, the 76ers will have an uphill battle trying to continue in the next series without their star center Joel Embiid.† The defending champion Milwaukee Bucks took care of the newly constructed Chicago Bulls team in 5 games. Antetokounmpo showed his playoff experience taking over the series game by game, while co-star Khris Middleton suffered an injury in the series that will keep him out for a significant portion of the series.† The last series of the first round featured the Boston Celtics sweeping the Brooklyn Nets. Many thought the Nets could pull off the first round upset since they were to feature the perennial stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. However, the young stars of the Celtics, like defensive player of the year Marcus Smart and all-star Jayson Tatum, were able to play sound defensive with efficient scoring.† With no upsets occurring in the first round of the playoffs, the big favorite to pull off the upset has to be the Bucks already up 1-0 in the second round and the Warriors, who are finally fully healthy this season.† A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the May 5, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The Miami Grand Prix had many of the familiar winners near the top of the podium. The winner of the race, Max Verstappen, is the reigning Formula 1 winner, followed by current leader Charles Leclerc. Rounding off the podium was Leclerc's Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.† Men's professional soccer is nearing a close to the club season and, with that, the end of the Champions League is approaching with the final set as Spanish club Real Madrid will face the English club, Liverpool. Real Madrid got to the finals in a thrilling come-from-behind victory against the leading club in the Premier League, Manchester City. Liverpool easily cruised through to the final, beating the surprise semifinals team Villarreal.† The most anticipated soccer match in the world will take place on May 28 at Paris Saint-Germain's field in Paris for the Champions League Final. In the Football Association Women's Super League (FAWSL), another crowned champion, Chelsea, continued their dominance in the league, capturing their third consecutive FAWSL title and their fourth title in the last five seasons. Arsenal was close to regaining the top position with a victory over West Ham, but it was eventually lost when Chelsea secured their 4-2 victory. In the NHL, the first round of the playoffs has gotten underway with a majority of the series being closely contested, besides the 3-0 series lead the Colorado Avalanche have over the Nashville Predators. One of the wildest series has been the Los Angeles Kings versus the Edmonton Oilers with a 2-2 series split. Featuring one of the best players in the league, Connor McDavid, the Oilers followed a 3-4 opening game loss by winning the next two games by 6 goals each. However, the Kings responded with a dominant 4-0 win in the fourth game to level the series.† The boxing and fighting world had quite the weekend, featuring title fights for UFC and in boxing.

Then, on the men's side, Charles Oliveira claimed a submission victory against the current title holder of the lightweight belt, Justin Gaethje. However, since Oliveira was not able to make weight at the weigh-in, the belt will remain vacant in the division.† Last was the highly anticipated boxing match between the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter Canelo √Ålvarez and the undefeated Dmitry Bivol. In an attempt to gain the 175-pound title after securing all four world titles at 168 pounds, √Ålvarez was put to a halt, losing easily via unanimous decision to Bivol. √Ålvarez, being the smaller fighter at 5-foot-8-inches, wasn't able to connect like Bivol, who used his 6-foot reach to his advantage.† A version of this article appeared on p.7 of the May 12, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

""úDerby Day""ù is a world-famous event ""î renowned just as much for the fancy hats and outfits as for the race itself. The cultural event this year seemed to evoke the kind of atmosphere that has not been seen on the racetrack since 2019. Due to the pandemic, the race had zero spectators in 2020, and was severely limited in 2021. But, this year, nearly 150,000 people came out to watch the race and drink the iconic mint julep cocktails that are forever linked to the race.  Most folks don't pay attention to horse races, but the race this year was such a news story due to its surprising finish and unlikely winner. First, the role of sports betting should be noted in the current climate of athletics. In 2021, more and more states legalized sports betting, and more are expected to legalize it following the 2022 elections. Many states are legalizing sports betting for the possibly immense tax revenues, and many sports leagues ""î which are suffering lower viewership among younger demographics ""î are encouraging betting as a way to hopefully make the sports-watching process a more interactive experience. One can watch the ad breaks during any sports event nowadays and see that almost half of the commercials are dedicated to some app or another ""î usually promoted by a celebrity ""î which facilitates legalized betting on sports events. And, with horse races being arguably the most expected sport to be gambled on, the Kentucky Derby had its fair share of bettors ""î but perhaps the least number of winners in the event's history.† This year's Kentucky Derby had a record $179 million in the pool, but had a just roughly $500,000 bet on the actual winner of the race ""î Rich Strike. Rich Strike, a 3-year-old Thoroughbred, was the second-biggest longshot winner of the Derby of all time. The odds of winning for this horse were 80-1, and in Circa Sportsbook, a casino in Las Vegas, the odds were an unheard of 300-1. This horse's history of racing itself can be noted for less-than-astounding runs, but Rich Strike turned out a miracle on Saturday for any of the people foolish or lucky enough to have bet on him. In the mile and a quarter race on a dirt track, Rich Strike had a usually poor start to the race and, at one point, was all the way in 18th place ""î approximately 17 full lengths behind the initial leader of the pack. It was only in the final home stretch that Rich Strike finally gained momentum, emerged from the heavy traffic in the middle of the pack and took the lead in the final seconds to eventually seize the victory ""î to the surprise of almost every spectator watching the race. The Kentucky Derby is a race where heavy favorites almost always win ""î Justify, the most recent Derby and Triple Crown winner in 2018, had odds of 3.5 to 1 at the time. With the previous several years being disheartening for so many around the world, an incredible underdog-comeback story taking place in an environment where wealth can be seen all around is something that can perhaps make sports more uplifting in the years to come. The next major races in the Triple Crown are the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 21, and the Belmont Stakes in New York on June 11. Rich Strike's odds have increased to 5-1 overnight, but he is still not seen as a favorite, so time will tell how these races unfold.

A select number of athletes from the distance event groups headed north to the Fresno State Invitational that same weekend to face some of their best competition yet.  The Gauchos truly rose to the occasion, coming home with 9 new marks to add to UCSB's top 10 performances of all time as well as dozens of personal records. With the Big West Track & Field Championships beginning last weekend, the Gauchos are peaking at just the right time. In throws, junior Jared Freeman led the team with a massive discus PR of 54.10 meters. The mark puts him 3rd on the UCSB top 10 list for discus, and will likely qualify him for the 2022 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field West Preliminary Rounds at the University of Oregon next month. Also in discus, sophomore Saloni Khandhadia threw back-to-back PRs, finishing out with a mark of 47.24 meters. In the javelin, senior Kendall Martin threw another PR of 43.64 meters, keeping her at 4th all-time at UCSB.† The distance team also had a strong showing, with reigning conference champion graduate Nick Randazzo knocking 3 seconds off his record 3000-meter steeple time. His new time of 8:58.50 keeps him 9th-best all-time at UCSB. In the same event, sophomore Sierra Ransweiler clocked 4:48.54 in the 1500-meter run.† The sprint team certainly held their own, led by freshman Jessica Boyd, whose incredible 11.98-second 100-meter dash ties her at 5th all-time at UCSB. Boyd will attempt to break the school record next meet, which hovers within reach at 11.80 seconds. In the men's 100-meter dash, junior Justin Fong tied for the 9th-best mark at UCSB, clocking a cool 10.76 seconds, followed closely by sophomore Ryan Searl at 10.83 seconds. Searl also performed well in the 200-meter dash, running a PR of 21.82 seconds. ""úThis was the most complete team performance we've had this season,""ù said Director of Cross Country/Track and Field Cody Fleming. ""úWe have momentum which is where you want your team to be heading into the Big West Championship. We take pride in being a balanced program and that was on full display in Irvine. Our sprinters went off and the throwers, jumpers and distance runners were right there with them.

The streak continued as the team beat the Waves 7-4, in a game where sophomore infielder Jordan Sprinkle and subbed-in redshirt junior outfielder Broc Mortensen each gathered 3 runs batted in.†††††††††††† Following their 1-game victory on Tuesday, the Gauchos responded by taking 2 of 3 games against UC Irvine and retaining possession of first place in the Big West Conference.† The first game of the series went in favor of a 2-0 Gaucho victory that was dominated by the pitching on both sides of the ball. The Gauchos' starting pitcher, sophomore Cory Lewis, pitched 7 innings, giving up just 1 hit and 4 walks, while striking out 5 batters. The hitters produced 1 inning of scoring in the 5th inning, with senior outfielder Jason Willow producing a sacrifice fly out to score Sprinkle and freshman catcher Aaron Parker driving in junior infielder Kyle Johnson with a triple. That proved to be enough run support as freshman pitcher Matt Ager came in and closed the door in order to pick up the save.† The second game had an opposite effect of what occurred in the first game with lots of scoring. The Gauchos, however, did fall in the second game to a score of 10-11 in favor of the Anteaters. The usually reliable duo of sophomore pitchers Mike Gutierrez and Michael Rice weren't on their A-game and allowed 7 runs in 5 innings, although only 2 earned runs were allowed by Gutierrez. On a bright note, the bats finally woke up with Johnson, redshirt junior infielder Bryce Willits, senior catcher Gianni Bloom and junior utility player Christian Kirtley each picking up 2 runs batted in.† In the final game of the series, the Gauchos were electric at the plate, leading to their 17-7 victory. Although the bullpen did allow 5 runs, there was enough insurance from the hitters in the lineup. Mortensen, Willow, Sprinkle and Willits all stayed comfortable at the plate, contributing RBIs, runs scored and multiple hit days. Starting freshman pitcher Ryan Gallagher tossed a solid outing, allowing just 2 runs across 5.1 innings pitched.† Looking onward to the Gauchos' remaining regular-season games, the hardest stretch is out of the way. The squad will play an out-of-conference, 3-game series versus a cold Dixie State team. Then, they will move on to play the Big West's worst team record-wise, UC Riverside, along with the 16-27 CSU Bakersfield team that has looked somewhat uninspiring.

sports,New Begginings for a Tough Softball Season,23-May-22,3:37 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-23/new-begginings-for-a-tough-softball-season/,"The UC Santa Barbara softball team's season came to a close this weekend as the Gauchos were swept by their in-conference opponent, Cal State Northridge. This came at the hands of losing to their other conference opponent, UC Riverside, the week prior. Although they had a rough go on the year finishing 15-39 and 6-21 in conference, the Gauchos had highlights sprinkled throughout their season.† In the beginning of March, the Gauchos put together an impressive winning streak, winning four games in a row by a combined score of 42-11. Also, along the way the Gauchos were able to take a game in each of their series against Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo and the University of Hawai ªi at Manoa. Better yet, in the last series of April, the squad was able to take the series versus their conference opponent UC Davis in the final game of the series.† As for the team, there were many positives to cancel out what would be ruled a disappointing season for the Gauchos. As the team's final game was senior day, it's only fitting that the leaders of at bats this season were three seniors, infielder Maci Fines, catcher Teah Thies and outfielder Ally Nodohara. Of the three, Fines has had the standout season for the Gauchos, leading the team with 6 triples and tied with the most doubles with 10. Another senior, first baseman Rayna Cohen amassed one less walk than strikeouts, which led to her team leading .419 on base percentage.† As for the returners, the best pitcher on the staff for the Gauchos was the sophomore pitcher standout Camryn Snyder, who put together a team leading 4.65 earned run average and racked up 7 wins, the most on the team. Junior pitcher Lexy Mills was the second-best pitcher, based on earned run average at 6.00 which came with a team leading 15 losses. Mills excelled on the hitting end as well producing the teams second-highest slugging percentage at .494 while hitting a pair of home runs.† Leading the underclassmen this season in hitting was sophomore infielder Madelyn McNally, who put together a .496 slugging percentage, the best on the team. On the base paths, McNally was a speed demon, swiping 10 stolen bases in 12 attempts. Sophomore catcher and utility player Ashley Donaldson is another piece in the rebuild moving forward, after putting up a .385 slugging percentage, .358 on base percentage and hitting a home run.† Overall, of the 10 batters who were given the most at bats this season, only 4 of the 10 were seniors, so there shouldn't be too much turnover headed into the new season. On the pitching side, of the five most used pitchers, none of them happened to be a senior which means room to improve next season like for the Gauchos as a whole. With every low note on the year, there were always many positives, and this year is progress for a young Gauchos softball program.

sports,Reigning NBA Champs Are Out,23-May-22,3:35 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-23/reigning-nba-champs-are-out/,"In the 2022 NBA playoffs, the underdogs have managed to climb out of the Western Conference while the Eastern Conference features the top two seeds. The Eastern Conference finals will be a matchup of the No. 1 seed Miami Heat versus the No. 2 seed Boston Celtics. On the other side, the Western Conference finals will be a matchup of the No. 3 seed Golden State Warriors versus the No. 4 seed Dallas Mavericks. Starting with the biggest underdogs, the Mavericks were in another tough battle with the Phoenix Suns following their series with the Utah Jazz. This was the battle of the star guards, with Devin Booker from the Suns and Luka Donƒçiƒá from the Mavericks. The Mavericks were relentless in this series, first battling back from a 0-2 deficit in the series and then a 2-3 deficit. In the end, the Mavericks put on a rout in Game 7 with the final score being 123-90, with Chris Paul and Booker being nonfactors in the play for the Suns. However, it is worth noting that it was announced after the series finale that Paul had been dealing with an injury throughout the series.† The other Western Conference semifinals game dealt with injuries, as the Warriors' defensive guard Gary Payton II was hurt in Game 1 while the Grizzlies' young star Ja Morant was hurt in Game 3, forcing him to miss the rest of the series. With the Grizzlies already down 1-2 when Morant hit the shelf, the Warriors capitalized on this opportunity, winning a narrow Game 4 to go up 3-1 in series. Then, after getting blown out by the Grizzlies in Game 5, the Warriors returned the favor, cruising to an easy Game 6 victory to close the series.† In the Eastern Conference semifinal matchup between the Heat and the Philadelphia 76ers, another key player was dealing with an injury: Joel Embiid with a facial fracture. With Embiid's restrictions on the court, the Heat raced out to a 2-0 series lead behind their star guard Jimmy Butler. Back on their home court, the 76ers were able to tie up the series behind efforts from their newly acquired guard James Harden running the offense. Their comeback proved to be short-lived, as the Heat took the next two games in dominant fashion, winning Game 5 by 35 points and holding the 76ers to 90 points in Game 6. In the last series, although the higher-seeded Boston Celtics beat the Milwaukee Bucks, most still favored the defending champion Bucks to come away with the series victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo tried his best to get the Bucks into the conference finals, averaging 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game. Without his all-star guard Khris Middleton, Antetokounmpo found that the barrier of the Celtics proved to be too much, as Jayson Tatum provided the kryptonite to thwart the Bucks' attempt to repeat as champions.† It will be the battle of positions in the conference finals as Butler and Tatum will go head-to-head at the forward position, and Stephen Curry and Donƒçiƒá will each orchestrate their offenses against each other

With that being said, here is the best of the 2021-22 UCSB men's basketball team. Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus Coming off a successful 2021 season, senior forward Amadou Sow comes in as the best overall player and best defensive player. Sow had a solid year averaging almost a double-double with a rate of 15.6 points per game and 8.4 rebounds per game; both numbers led the team. Sow also led the team in blocks per game and averaged almost 1 block every appearance.† The best freshman for UCSB this year was guard Ajay Mitchell. In his first year as a Gaucho, Mitchell led the entire team in minutes per game (32.1) while also averaging 11.6 points per game and 3.7 assists per contest. The freshman also averaged around 1 steal in each game he played. Mitchell was also heavily featured in UCSB's starting lineup, as he started in 23 of the 28 games the Gauchos played this year. The Gauchos' best game of the year was a 72-45 drubbing of the Cal State Northridge Matadors. This margin of victory was the largest for UCSB against any Big West Conference opponent this season and was a rare showing of total dominance for the Gauchos this year. Senior forward Miles Norris led the team in scoring for this game by scoring 31 points and shooting 9 out of 10 from behind the 3-point line. Unfortunately, the Gauchos did not have the season they'd hoped for after bowing out to Long Beach State in the Big West Tournament semifinals. Head coach Joe Pasternack and his squad will look to pick up the pieces and return to contending form in the Big West in the 2022-23 season.† A version of this article appeared on p. 13 of the May 26, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Invincible or Insatiable? Why Tom Brady Refuses To Retire,31-May-22,1:40 PM,"[""Gabriel O'Brien""]",https://dailynexus.com/2022-05-31/invincible-or-insatiable-why-tom-brady-refuses-to-retire/,"The sports headlines, as well as news headlines in general, were on fire the first day of February this year when Tom Brady ""î the undoubted Greatest of All Time of professional football ""î officially announced his retirement from the National Football League. And though he is well past the age of the typical NFL quarterback, let alone one who can still play at an elite level, the announcement still took the nation by surprise. Had this been several seasons prior, when sports announcers were saying that Brady would ""úfall off a cliff""ù in terms of his capability to perform at an elite level ""î and especially after he fell to the ragtag Tennessee Titans in the first round of the playoffs in his final 2019 season for the New England Patriots ""î perhaps then his retirement would have made sense.  However, Brady has never been one to settle for anyone else's definition of himself. The same man who rose from obscurity as a sixth round draft pick-turned-benchwarmer all the way back in 2000, to eventually win six Super Bowls for the same team, was not easily deterred. The moniker of Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) was already being given to him after his unlikely fifth Super Bowl win in 2017, coming back from a notorious 28-3 deficit to Atlanta in the second half. With his fifth championship victory, Brady eclipsed the four rings that other quarterback greats had earned ""î including the Pittsburgh Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the San Francisco 49ers' Joe Montana, who Brady grew up idolizing as a boy in San Mateo. But Brady had always been inextricably linked to the similarly intense Bill Belichick, who was rumored to have mulled over replacements for Brady ""î especially during the Deflategate saga of 2016. So, while everybody else was nothing but confused during 2020, Tom Brady was certain that he wanted to switch teams and play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ""î sometimes referred to as the ""úSuckaneers""ù for their historic record of losing. When Brady brought Tampa a Super Bowl in his very first season there, and at the ripe old age of 43, the name G.OA.T. was a sure thing. He had succeeded in setting himself apart from the rest ""î and had even defeated Patrick Mahomes II ""î the heir apparent of the NFL for the new generation. Surely, he could call it quits now, right? Nope. Tom Brady's decision to continue playing in the NFL became both impressive and a punchline. Since the quadragenarian was unstoppable against foes who were half his age, he routinely poked fun at either his retirement, or on how long he would continue playing for, in commercials or interviews. After one more year with Tampa, Tom fell just short of victory in the NFC Divisional Round against the Los Angeles Rams ""î who would go on to hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy. But before the Rams would reach the big game, Brady dropped the announcement ""î after his retirement news, he was hijacked by investigative reporting. In typical Brady fashion, he was the center of attention. Many thought he'd take the season off, then return, but Brady took just over a month to change his mind. But more than the confusing retirement announcement making his actual quitting seem hollow, Brady's final dance in the NFL did not live up to everyone's expectations of the man who has almost ascended to legend status. His final season lacked the Hollywood ending that he seemed to be making for himself in his own endeavors ""î endeavors that give us a glimpse into what we can expect from Brady in the next chapter of his life. With all the net worth he has accumulated from football, Brady could retire for hundreds of lifetimes. But Brady has branched out into a new health and lifestyle brand ""î appropriately titled TB12, in reference to his initials as well as the number that is synonymous with his name. Brady's TB12 offers everything from clothing and apparel to nutrition products. The company is successful, as it is connected to the world famous sports star. Although, it has attracted additional coverage for the quarterback since some of the health advice has been deemed to be unconventional. Brady's own diet has attracted some attention. Brady has a strange list of foods he eats and does not eat. What he does eat is 80% vegan, which may very well have a lot of health benefits. But Brady also apparently lays off white sugar, coffee, tomatoes, mushrooms, bread or any dairy. What he does consume is, allegedly, 37 glasses of water a day. For this, and a multitude of other reasons, Brady's brand has come under criticism as being pseudoscientific. Nevertheless, building a brand in the world of sports has been a big success for Brady in building a brand around himself.† Brady's new endeavors are even more telling of what we can expect for his future though. He founded 199 Productions, a film studio conspicuously named after his draft number to remind folks out there of Brady's meteoric, Hollywood-like rise from oblivion to the heights of athleticism. He already has a new movie being released by his studio starring Hollywood legends Sally Field and Jane Fonda among others. The film will be titled ""ú80 for Brady,""ù and it centers around a group of elderly fans who travel across country to watch Brady in the 2017 Super Bowl ""î perhaps the greatest moment of Brady's career.† The most recent hint that Brady cannot play until he is eligible for Social Security came with the news that Brady will continue his sports career as a play-by-play commentator for FOX Sports. Brady will apparently earn $375 million over 10 years. Most people in Brady's position would have no problem walking away after a comparable career. Brady has broken nearly every single record of an NFL quarterback ""î including total touchdown passes, passing yards, completions, games won and so much more. This is not even mentioning the staggering seven Super Bowl championships, the 10 total appearances and three NFL MVPs. I have probably rooted for his opponents in every single Super Bowl he has been in, but there's always that one part of me that wants to see him succeed. No matter how much more successful he gets, Brady will still always be the ultimate underdog. He is the David and Goliath story in American sports. Starting from a humble upbringing, overlooked status as a football player starting out and a dim horizon of ever even getting off the bench, Brady has become a household name by exhibiting the up-by-the-bootstraps work ethic that is often still unreachable for so many out there. Nevertheless, we still hope that ""î in whatever field we hope to break into ""î we can be successful ourselves, especially still when we reach older age. Brady is definitely set to return this 2022-23 football season, and this truly seems like it will be his last dance. Brady has many options on the horizon that are both lucrative and exciting. But, if Brady's career has proven anything, it is more than profit that motivates him. It is the desire to do something that has never been done before. And while this seems impossible for such a veteran of the sport who now sets his sights on Hollywood and entertainment, a cinematic ending to his career is something that we can all definitely count on.

Not only did the team sweep UC Riverside this weekend, but this sweep was the clincher that propelled them to take home the Big West conference title.  The Gauchos ended Game 1 against UCR in dramatic fashion, coming back from a deficit in the 9th inning to walk it off with a sacrifice fly from sophomore infielder Jordan Sprinkle. The following two games from the Gauchos were far from close contests, ending Game 2 with a score of 6-0 and Game 3 with a score of 14-2. Stellar pitching in these games came from sophomore pitcher Mike Gutierrez and freshman pitcher Ryan Gallagher.† Senior day did not disappoint as a plethora of players had an outstanding hitting day. Sprinkle, who is an MLB draft prospect, ended his career on a high note contributing with 4 runs batted in and a triple. Senior catcher Mason Eng started his first career collegiate home run in his final regular season game. Senior outfielder Jason Willow and junior outfielder Broc Mortensen also had themselves a day, swiping two bases each contributing to the Gauchos 10 stolen bases on the day.† As for the Gauchos, this marks the third straight 40-win season (excluding 2020 when the team's record was 13-2) as they eclipsed the mark on their very last regular season game. This game also secured the Big West Title and secured the Gauchos a spot in the NCAA Division 1 Baseball Championship regionals. Next up for the Gauchos is either hosting the regionals at their home stadium or traveling to another school to take part in the regionals.

Although he will help a Magic squad that has struggled offensively, pundits wonder how the team will shape up with Banchero, Wendell Carter Jr., and Franz Wagner.† The Oklahoma City Thunder had the second pick, and were rightly ecstatic that their future center was available. Chet Holmgren was drafted to the Thunder at pick two, and the Thunder also made two more splashes in the first round drafting Ousmane Dieng and Jalen Williams at picks 11 and 12. Dieng is a pick for the future with raw skills, while Williams was taken earlier than most expected by Oklahoma City.† The next three picks were Jabari Smith Jr. to the Rockets, Keegan Murray to the Kings and Jaden Ivey to the Pistons. Smith to the Rockets was the best player of the big three picks, as the Rockets would have taken Holmgren or Banchero, most likely. Murray to the Kings was as expected, seeing their team not offer a workout to Ivey, but many wondered if they would regret not taking the high upside guard.† A steal in the first round came when the Portland Trail Blazers picked up dynamic offensive playmaker Shaedon Sharpe in the hopes of pairing him with star point guard Damian Lillard. Although Sharpe didn't play at the University of Kentucky this past season, the skilled guard showed enough to get him drafted in the lottery.† The Cleveland Cavaliers made some selections throughout the draft that fitted their mold of defense while adding some shooting along the way. First, they drafted Ochai Agbaji who led his Kansas University squad to the national championship. They also drafted Isaiah Mobley, brother of star rookie player Evan Mobley, creating an interesting defensive tandem in the paint.† Following Banchero, a significant number of Duke players were picked in this year's draft. Mark Williams was drafted to the Charlotte Hornets in the 15th round, and A.J. Griffin to the Atlanta Hawks at pick 16. Trevor Keels was drafted to the New York Knicks in the second round.† There were a number of undrafted players who many assumed would be drafted based on pedigree or rankings. Scottie Pippen Jr., son of the legendary small forward, who had an impressive Vanderbilt career that didn't end up getting him drafted as an undersized guard, was not picked. Kenneth Lofton Jr. and Ron Harper Jr. ""ì two forwards that many thought would get drafted ""ì ultimately didn't hear their name called.† As always the NBA draft is only speculative, so with many athletes being drafted and signed, there will always be the busts and steals of every draft.

Vincent has made strides throughout this 2021-22 season, and has solidified himself as an impact sub and strong rotational player for the Heat. While the Heat play primarily through Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, they depend on their others like Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson to hit critical shots.†  With the introduction of Vincent, the Heat went from ranking 19th in 3-point percentage in 2020-21, to ranking third in the league this past season. Vincent played a key role in this development with his 8.7 points per game ""ì more than double what he averaged last season. In the postseason Vincent made an even bigger impact by scoring 15 points in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals.† Prior to his success in the NBA, Vincent had a notable career in the NCAA. He attended UC Santa Barbara as an undergraduate, and was a member of the UCSB Men's Basketball team from 2015 to 2018. As a Gaucho, Vincent averaged 12.8 points per game, and in 2016, led UCSB to the Vegas 16 Semifinals. He then went undrafted to the Miami Heat and has improved each season. Vincent has solidified himself as one of the most developed Gauchos in the NBA. With fellow Gaucho JaQuori McLaughlin entering the league this past season, there is hope for an upward trend of UCSB alumni achieving success in their transition to the NBA.† Standing 6 foot, 3 inches tall at shooting guard, Vincent has a very polished play style that specializes in his shooting and defense. Vincent was named the Most Improved Player in the NBA G League for the 2019-20 season. His efforts and determination allowed him to be a standout undrafted player for the Miami Heat. Heat Head Coach Erik Spoelstra had high praise for Vincent after he took over the starting spot of an injured Kyle Lowry. Spoelstra stated, ""úGabe is a great competitor and he's been able to shape-shift into different roles, which is really important. That is a talent.""ù The Miami Heat had a record of 27-23 when Vincent was on the court.† Vincent is paving the way for many collegiate athletes outside the prestigious athletic schools of the NCAA. An individual like Vincent, who went undrafted and managed to scrape his way onto a strong rotational role for a contending NBA team, further proves how there is no one path to success. Vincent demonstrates that for individuals looking to do anything at a professional level, efforts and sheer will exceed any accredited background.

The Toronto Blue Jays sent two of their players, slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. at first base and first-time All-Star, Alejandro Kirk as catcher,† into the starting lineup. The Los Angeles Angels also have two starters, sending two of the most talented players in MLB history: right-handed pitcher Shohei Ohtani and outfielder Mike Trout. Chicago White Sox's standout, Tim Anderson will be starting at shortstop and the Red Sox's Rafael Devers got the nod at third. The last starter for the American League is former MVP Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros at second base.† As for the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers are the only squad starting two players: Shortstop Trea Turner and outfielder Mookie Betts will take their positions at their home field. Former Dodger Manny Machado will be starting at the hot corner in his return to the all-star game as a San Diego Padre. Another former Dodger will be making his return as San Francisco Giants' Joc Pederson will be starting in the outfield alongside Ronald Acuna Jr. of the Atlanta Braves. Behind the plate, Willson Contreras of the Chicago Cubs will be the starting catcher, with the reliable Paul Goldschmidt of the St. Louis Cardinals at first base. Philadelphia Phillies' Bryce Harper received the fan votes for designated hitter, however, he will have to miss the game due to injury. Rounding out the starters for the National League will be up-and-coming star Jazz Chisholm from the Miami Marlins at second base.† Some notable names lie in the reserves as well. Albert Pujols of the Cardinals and Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers were not voted in, but rather included as legacy nominees. Other star players in the National League like Washington Nationals' Juan Soto and Cardinals' Nolan Arenado made it as backups. Some breakout players that made it this season include former No. 1 overall pick Dansby Swanson of the Braves and Cubs former top prospect Ian Happ.† The pitchers on the National League team feature most notably, the legendary Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers, with many wanting him to be named the starting pitcher for the National League. Other contenders to make the start are Dodgers' standout Tony ""úCat Man""ù Gonsolin, Marlins' strikeout machine Sandy Alcantara, or Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes of the Milwaukee Brewers. Some relievers include the flamethrowers Edwin Diaz of the New York Mets and Brewers' lefty Josh Hader. Two breakout relievers featured in the game this year are David Bednar of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Joe Mantiply of the Arizona Diamondbacks.† As for the American league reserves, Astros' Yordan Alvarez has the best hitting stats of the pack but will miss the game due to injury. His teammate Kyle Tucker and rookie stud Julio Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners are featured as the backup outfielders. Cleveland Guardians' Andres Gimenez and Jos√© Ram√≠rez have each produced outstanding hitting seasons, warranting all-star invites. Jose Trevino of the Yankees made his first game as a seasoned veteran, enjoying a nice hitting and defensive breakout as the Yankees platoon catcher.† Pitchers Nestor Cortes, Gerrit Cole, and Clay Holmes of the Yankees of the American League east make up the reserve for the American League. The Blue Jays are sending their talented ace Alek Manoah, while the Tampa Bay Rays are sending their hard throwing lefty Shane McClanahan. Last out of the American League East, the Baltimore Orioles are sending breakout reliever Jorge Lopez. Angels' Ohtani was once again voted in as a designated hitter and a pitcher. Oakland Athletics' Paul Blackburn and Texas Rangers' Martin Perez earned them their first trips to the all-star game as well.† This year's all-star game will feature some of the veterans in one of their many all-star games and also some of the future players that will carry the league once the aging veterans retire.†

sports,"""ã""ãMLB trade deadline is heating up | The ",8-Aug-22,7:37 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-08-08/%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8bmlb-trade-heating-up/,"Every year during this week of the major league baseball season there is a variety of teams that are trading away their best players. This is due to the annual MLB trade deadline ""ì† 3 p.m. on August 2, 2022. After this deadline, no more trades can take place. With certain teams not being able to compete for a championship, they trade away some of their older talent in order to restock their minor league system for the future seasons to come.† Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons The blockbuster deal everybody is talking about took place between the San Diego Padres and the Washington Nationals. The Nationals offered a max extension to their star player Juan Soto, but to their surprise, he turned down their offer, forcing the Nationals to announce one of the best players in the MLB would be available for trade talks after a dramatic week of speculation.† The frontrunners for landing Soto were the Los Angeles Dodgers, Padres, and the St. Louis Cardinals. In the end, the Padres were willing to offer the most to their top tier prospects as well as willing to part with their best major league prospects and a combination of high-level minor-league talent.† The Dodgers did not want to part ways with Dustin May and the Cardinals did not want to part ways with Nolan Gorman. The Padres were able to acquire not only Soto plus but also one the best hitting first basemen, Josh Bell. In return, the Nationals acquired CJ Abrams, Robert Hassell III, Mackenzie Gore, James Wood, Jarlin Susana and Luke Voit. Abrams and Gore are both young prospects who have been in the majors for a majority of the season and should slot into starting roles on a depleted Nationals squad. Voit will move into the vacant first base spot while the others will be developmental prospects as a part of the trade.† The Padres spotted a utility player as they traded for the Cincinnati Reds' Brandon Drury who is in the midst of having one of his best seasons. In the process, the Padres opened up a roster spot by trading first baseman Eric Hosmer to the Boston Red Sox.† Around the league there has been movement from almost every MLB team, either buying or selling their players. The Philadelphia Phillies in particular have been active this deadline making a flurry of moves. They acquired Noah Syndergaard from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and in a separate move got Brandon Marsh from the Angels in exchange for their former number one overall pick, Mickey Moniak.† The New York Yankees did some moving on the final day, trading away the struggling Joey Gallo and their veteran pitcher Jordan Montgomery. In exchange they picked up Harrison Bader from the Cardinals, which comes after acquiring Frankie Montas the prior afternoon.† The Minnesota Twins made sneaky moves getting Tyler Mahle from the Reds who has been a solid starter, and All-Star closer from the Baltimore Orioles. They weren't done there, as they traded for Detroit Tigers' veteran pitcher Michael Fulmer.† The Dodgers took in Joey Gallo from the Yankees but in the process managed to trade away their hot-hitter Jake Lamb and young pitcher Mitch White.† In a buzzer beater deal right before the trade deadline came to a close the Atlanta Braves swooped in on the Angels' fire sale, signing their talented closer Raisel Iglesias. The Toronto Blue Jays were also trading up until the deadline and were able to swoop longtime Kansas City Royal, Whit Merrifield.† This year's MLB trade deadline comes to a close but expect many more moves as teams release and designate players for assignment to make room for their new players.†

The Gauchos are coming off a season in which they won the Big West Conference Tournament and were placed in the NCAA Division 1 Men's Soccer Tournament. Although the Gauchos lost in the first round, it was to a talented Pac-12 school, UCLA who they lost to 0-1 in double overtime.   Coming off the 2021 season, their first preseason game came against the San Jose State Spartans. In the match, the Gauchos were completely dominant, winning 4-1 with the scrimmage being split into three 30-minute periods. The goals in the first game came from sophomore defender Lucas Gonzalez, sophomore forward Salvador Aguilar, freshman midfielder Eddie Villeda and sophomore midfielder Filip Basili. This was a true scrimmage game for the Gauchos as each of the active members of the squad were able to get some minutes on the field. One area they looked to improve was the fouls they committed on the pitch, which can also be attributed to it being their first preseason match.† The second preseason scrimmage was one that is an annual tradition, as the Gauchos hosted the Westmont College Warriors at Harder Stadium for the Community Shield Game. This was a dominating performance by the Gauchos, taking an easy 4-0 victory with goals from Aguilar, Basili and junior forward Finn Ballard McBride with Aguilar scoring his second goal of the night. The Gauchos once again were clicking on offense producing 26 shots and 12 shots on goal. Even more impressive, the Gauchos were able to hold Westmont to a mere 3 shots, with none of them forcing a save out of the UCSB's keepers.† With the squad returning 10 of 11 starters from their Big West 2021 squad, it is easy to have high expectations for a talented team that added even more firepower. The Gauchos will go on to face Missouri State in Missouri for their opening season match. Then, they will play host to California Baptist University to end the month of play.† The Gauchos should be the favorites but look for the squad to be interchangeable until the regular season gets underway.

Being a Division 1 program, the Gauchos were seen as heavy favorites in this match as the Warriors are featured in the NAIA Division of collegiate sports. Nonetheless, the purpose of this match was to get players back into playing speed and to mesh together the team before the regular season begins.† In the match, the Gauchos were only able to muster one goal, but it proved to be a decisive one as they came away with a 1-0 victory. In the first half of the match, UCSB came out firing, creating 2 shots on goal within the first 20 minutes of the match, prompting the Warriors' senior goalie Kailey Meyer into two comfortable saves. The Gauchos' defense played a crucial role in this match, not allowing a single shot from the Warriors. The Gauchos persisted in attacking the Westmont defense in the first half, putting the pressure on with 6 shots ""ì 4 of them being on goal.† To begin the second half, the Gauchos managed to string together good passing within the visitors side of the field but couldn't convert their opportunities. Finally, in the 81st minute the Gauchos capitalized on their possession and scored a goal. Sophomore midfielder Avery Nicholas assisted sophomore forward Meg Burling, who rose up from the cross and converted it into the back of the net for the Gauchos' lone goal.† In the following two games the women's team took on the Colorado College Tigers and the Gaels of Saint Mary's College of California.† During the first official non-conference match the Gauchos had trouble on both sides of the ball as they were outshot with the targets on goal and lost the match 1-2 due to a lack of defensive efforts. Sophomore goalkeeper Taylor Little played the full 90 minutes, saving 2 shots on target.† † Against Saint Mary's the Gauchos continued a bit of a rough stretch of offensive play. They were outshot with shots on goal 2-4 and did not score at all. This match saw senior goalkeeper Evann Smith, who allowed one goal while the Gauchos could not manage to scrape across any, leading to their 0-1 loss.† The Gauchos' next match will be against Sacramento State, followed by another away non-conference match against Stanford.† UCSB will host their next match at Harder Stadium on September 1, when they will take on Pepperdine.

In 2021, the Gauchos finished in second place with a 21-11 overall record while going 17-3 against conference opponents.† The Gauchos will look for production from four returners who were on the all-conference team in 2021 to improve their record from last season. These returners are senior middle blocker Deni Wilson,† junior libero Macall Peed, junior outside hitter Michelle Ohwobete and senior right side Tallulah Froley.

sports,Is Tat√≠s still the face of the MLB?,5-Sep-22,5:54 PM,['Isaiah Ochoa'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-09-05/is-tatis-still-the-face-of-the-mlb/,"Major League Baseball recently suspended the San Diego Padres shortstop Fernando Tat√≠s Jr. for 80 games. The reason for the suspension was that Tatis Jr. tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance called Clostebol.†  When the news broke, Tat√≠s Jr. appealed the suspension in hopes of possibly lowering the number of games suspended or reversing the suspension ruling. However, shortly after the appeal, he issued a statement through Major League Baseball (MLB) Players Association Communications to social media stating, ""úAfter initially appealing the suspension, I have realized that my mistake was the cause of this result, and for that reason, I have decided to start serving my suspension immediately.""ù In that same statement, Tat√≠s Jr. admits that he did take the performance-enhancing drug, but he took it through medication to treat ringworm. A few days after the suspension announcement on social media, Tat√≠s Jr.'s dad, Fernando Tat√≠s Sr., stated that his son received ringworm from a haircut.† It is expected that when an athlete is caught taking performance-enhancing drugs, they usually lie to the public. It wasn't surprising that no one, including his teammates, was thrilled to hear the news when it broke. Teammates Manny Machado and Mike Clevinger stated to the media that they were disappointed in him and have made it this far in the season without him With Tat√≠s Jr. receiving a lot of heat from fans and teammates, his mother felt the need to defend her son. She tried to convince people that the ringworm story was true by posting a picture of Tatis Jr.'s neck on Instagram.† The effort of Tat√≠s Jr.'s parents trying to clear their son's name was a reasonable effort but unimpressive to baseball media and fans. With Tat√≠s Jr.'s history of lying to the media, no one believed him for many reasons.† When a player has any health issues, it is always recommended to go through the team doctor or another doctor off-site that has been approved by the organization. This is because the doctors know what to prescribe the athlete without giving them banned substances, and Tat√≠s Jr. failed to follow protocol.† Earlier in the season, Tat√≠s Jr. reported to Spring Training where the Padres announced that the star shortstop had suffered a broken wrist due to a motorcycle accident in December. When the accident occurred, MLB was in a lockout with the Major League Baseball players' union. At that time, Tat√≠s Jr. could not contact anybody associated with the Padres organization.† Unfortunately, Tat√≠s Jr. made himself look worse later on. When Tat√≠s Jr. was questioned about his motorcycle accident by the media, he asked, ""úWhich one?""ù Again, only one accident was reported.† Fast forward back to the suspension. The ringworm story, as one could guess, was false. H√©ctor G√≥mez, a verified MLB insider, tweeted that Tat√≠s Jr. began using skin cream back in March to try to hide the motorcycle accident.† Tat√≠s Jr. was very close to returning from injury before the suspension. However, the return will be delayed with him missing the remaining 48 games of this season and the first 32 games of next season. To add insult to injury, Tat√≠s Jr. can also not participate in the World Baseball Classic next year.† A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the August 25, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Manchester United blunder during opening weekend,5-Sep-22,6:04 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-09-05/manchester-united-blunder-during-opening-weekend/,"As the Premier League opening weekend came to a close, there were many storylines to follow, but none bigger than the ""únew era""ù at Manchester United. Coming off a disappointing season, Manchester United were primed to take a step forward with their new coach Erik ten Hag. Although they were coming off a tough end to their 2021-22 season, Manchester United were banking on bounce back seasons from their veteran players.†  Having some of the best players in the world like Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcus Rashford and David de Gea, Manchester United was still ranked fifth as a favorite to win the Premier League. On top of that, Ten Hag brought in a flurry of new players with Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Mart√≠nez being the two biggest names. However, there are many other rumors floating up in the air of whether that will be their last signings this window.† To open the season, Manchester United suffered a narrow 1-2 loss at the hands of Brighton & Hove Albion, who at times struggled to stay above the relegation zone. On top of that, Manchester United players did not manage to score a goal, with their only point in the game coming via an own goal from Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister. Although they had the majority of the possession, Manchester United lacked the decisive touch, only managing one more shot on goal than the largely out-possessed Brighton.† To make things worse, Manchester United followed this blunder of a performance by getting defeated† by the newly promoted squad, Brentford. Much like the previous game, Manchester United dominated the possession in the match but were outdone with shots on target by Brentford, ultimately losing the match 0-4. To make matters worse, the schedule for Manchester United begins to get increasingly difficult in the coming weeks.† Their next opponent, Liverpool, was ranked the second most likely to win the Premier League title and had one of the most recent Premier League titles outside of Manchester City. Although Liverpool had the second-best odds to win the Premier League title on paper, they have had two draws in their opening two matches of the season.† Not much to everyone's surprise, the defending Premier League champions, Manchester City, picked up right where they left off. Over the summer transfer window, they added one of the top strikers, Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund, along with midfielder Kalvin Phillips from Leeds United. In their first two matches they managed to take two victories, scoring 6 goals while allowing 0 goals to their opponents.† Off to another hot start is Arsenal, who managed to score 6 goals while conceding just 2 goals, which was good enough for second place to start league play. They were helped by their new Manchester City signings they secured over the summer: forward Gabriel Jesus and left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko.† With only a couple matches into the season, there is still much to come for new faces on new teams and managers adjusting to their squads.†  A version of this article appeared on p. 12 of the August 25, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,The 2022-23 fantasy football preview,5-Sep-22,6:08 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-09-05/the-2022-23-fantasy-football-preview/,"As the new NFL season is approaching, a new crop of fantasy football players are anxiously awaiting to see how their rosters do each Sunday. Fantasy football, for those who haven't played, is a game involving drafting a fantasy roster of NFL players with the goal of maximizing points to ensure your team wins each week against opponents in your fantasy league.†  Each year there are hundreds of analysts that release their own personal rankings and strategies that go into drafting the best possible team. Of course everyone wants the best players on their fantasy teams, but some strategists have begun to consider less popular players that they believe will prove successful.† At the running back position, ESPN Fantasy Football ranks J.K. Dobbins of the Baltimore Ravens as their No. 18 best running back by fantasy point projections. Although he is coming off a torn ACL, there are benefits to drafting him. For example, Dobbins will not have to split carries with the Ravens' backup running back, Gus Edwards, as he will be rehabbing from his injury for the start of the season. The Ravens have also gotten healthier in the offseason, picking up their number one weapon, Lamar Jackson, who should take much of the focus away from Dobbins.† Another running back getting overlooked is the New York Giants' star back, Saquon Barkley. Although injuries have been a concern for Barkley over the years, he is still only 25 years old and is primed for a monster season if he remains healthy. Not to mention, the Giants have restricted their offensive line after drafting offensive tackle Evan Neal in the first round out of the University of Alabama.† Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback Jalen Hurts is not getting the love he deserves being ranked as the sixth-best fantasy quarterback. After outscoring a majority of the quarterbacks last season in fantasy, Hurts added another weapon to the Eagles' receiver core that now consists of A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert.†† Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa ranks No. 17 in the quarterback rankings, which is notable due to the additions the team has made by acquiring Tyreek Hill. The shaky numbers shouldn't be of concern since the team has undergone a complete rebuild; Tagovailoa's improved passing displays in the Dolphins training camp.†† Moving on to the tight ends, Cole Kmet of the Chicago Bears is one to look out for this season. Sure, Darnell Mooney will take a majority of the receptions and yards for the Bears with Kmet, but at the end of the day, Kmet is the second-best option. Although the Bears don't project to be the most sure-fire team this season, it is worth noting their bad offensive line that may force Justin Fields to rely on his arm strength.† Lastly, don't draft any kickers or defenses in the fantasy leagues, as it will just dig at the draft picks. Those picks should instead be used on potential backup running backs in case of injury, which is common amongst running backs.†† In order to win fantasy football year in and year out, it comes down to a good draft, waiver wire moves and a little bit of luck for the players to stay healthy.

sports,Chet Holmgren out for the season without playing one NBA minute,15-Sep-22,1:31 PM,['Isaiah Ochoa'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-09-15/chet-holmgren-out-for-the-season-without-playing-one-nba-minute/,"Going into the 2022 NBA draft, multiple players could've been drafted at the No. 1 spot. One of these players was Chet Holmgren, a center out of Gonzaga University. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Coming out of high school, Holmgren had a lot of hype; he was a 5-star center and ranked the No. 1 player in the nation. There was no question that the 7-foot center with a 90-inch wingspan had unlimited potential. However, Holmgren's most crucial question was whether his weight would play a factor against bigger and thicker players. Holmgren's weight wasn't an issue at Gonzaga. In his first and only college season, Holmgren averaged 14 points, 10 rebounds, 2 assists and 3 blocks in 32 games.† With Holmgren able to play at a high level in college and with the unlimited potential he contained, he found himself drafted second overall in the 2022 NBA draft. The Oklahoma City Thunder took the 20-year-old center with plans to have him in their starting lineup. When Holmgren was drafted, everyone talked about how the Thunder had a young, promising three-player core. The core would contain Josh Giddey, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Holmgren.† Holmgren always had a cockiness to him whether he played basketball or talked to the media. Some might say that Holmgren has massive self-confidence, and others would say he is just cocky. No matter what side you are on, Holmgren put a target on his back on May 18. Bleacher Report Hoops posted an Instagram video asking Holmgren who he thinks is the best player in the NBA; Holmgren responded, ""úMyself in two months.""ù Fast forward three months, news broke out that Holmgren would miss the 2022-23 NBA season due to a Lisfranc injury.† The injury occurred during a Seattle pro-am game where Holmgren tried to stop a fastbreak against LeBron James, where James drove to the basket creating contact with Holmgren. When Holmgren jumped to contest the shot, he landed gingerly, hopping on one foot as if he rolled his ankle. Unfortunately, it was worse than a rolled ankle.† When the video and diagnosis came out, everyone thought that Holmgren got hurt due to his weight, since he weighs 195 pounds while James weighs 250 pounds.† Apparently, Holmgren's weight didn't come into play with this specific injury. Sam Presti, Thunder's general manager, revealed three of the top five foot specialists all agreed it was an accidental injury that could've happened to anyone, anywhere.† ""úThis is an acute injury. It's something where it's the result of him basically being pressed down, getting ready to jump at the exact time that he was getting force on his foot,""ù said Presti. ""úA millisecond earlier where he's up in the air already or a millisecond later where his foot is flat, then you're not dealing with something like this.""ù A Lisfranc injury occurs when at least one of the eight metatarsal bones is displaced from the foot. Holmgren's case was a rupture of the tendon, which is scarier since torn ligaments can cause more long-term damage. Holmgren did undergo a successful procedure, and if everything goes right, Presti believes that Holmgren will return in time for the 2023-24 NBA season.

However, UCSB entered the locker room at halftime down a goal as the Tritons outscored them in the 2nd quarter 2-1.

UCSD scored only 3 goals in the 2nd half combined. Sophomore center Dash McFarland led the scoring for UCSB with 3 goals in the game.

The leading scorer for this match McFarland again with 3 goals.† In their final game of the week, UCSB fell to Long Beach State. In this game, the Gauchos were never able to take the lead. At first, Long Beach made the score 2-0, but the Gauchos were able to tie the match at 2-2. However, Long Beach dominated the rest of the game, as they scored 3 goals in 44 seconds to take an 8-4 lead into the half. Brosnan was the only Gaucho with multiple goals, as he scored twice. With the three victories and single loss, the Gauchos improved their record to 6-4. UCSB's next matches will take place at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Invite.

With solid defense throughout the rest of the match, the Gauchos were able to hold their own until sophomore forward Meg Burling equalized the match at 1-1 in the 52nd minute.† Unlike the Cal Poly game, the Gauchos were the more dominant side in this match, shooting Pacific 9-4 with 3 shots on goal as opposed to Pacific's 1 shot on goal.

Redshirt sophomore midfielder Lucas Gonzalez set up the game-winning goal to junior forward Finn Ballard McBride, who is the Big West's leading scorer of the last 2 seasons.† The Gauchos picked up their second straight win when they took down a solid Pac-12 Oregon State team 3-1. Gonzalez and McBride started the game with a hot streak as Gonzalez picked up the first goal while McBride put the Gauchos up 2-0.

A strong initial offensive charge seemed to exhaust the team early as the Gauchos struggled to maintain possession of the ball and create any real threat on the Stanford goal in the 1-2 loss. UCSB student section at Harder Stadium before the flying tortillas. (Pia Ramos / Daily Nexus) The opening 10 minutes saw the Gauchos at their best, with purposeful and intricate passing against a sleepy Stanford. Their play was rewarded with an early goal from the team's most lethal striker this season, sophomore Salvador Aguilar, who improved to 5 goals in 9 games. Junior defender Timon Windisch sent a long overhead ball which should have been a comfortable reception and clearance for the Stanford Cardinal, but was mishandled. Aguilar's speed and 6-foot-2-inch frame allowed him to outmuscle the Stanford defender and slot a shot through the legs of the keeper. The goal served as a wake-up call for Stanford, who soon responded with their own string of passing plays that led to a goal. The Cardinal worked the ball through the Gaucho defense until Stanford forward Jackson Kiil found space between sophomore and senior defenders Caden Vom Steeg and Henry Davies in the 18-yard box, collected a pass and turned for a left-footed shot across the face of goal.† The momentum from the goal pushed the Gauchos back on the field as they were forced onto their back foot and dug in to defend for the rest of the match. Head coach Tim Vom Steeg acknowledged the difficulty of the Stanford attack but praised the team for their efforts. Coach Vom Steeg added that the team played the best soccer he's seen all season.† ""úIt was disappointing that we would go into halftime instead of being up 2-0, it's 1-1. It's also the least number of saves that [junior goalkeeper] Leroy [Zeller] has made all season [1]. So our defense played very well,""ù he said. Zeller added that the match acts as an indicator for where the team is compared to the top 5 in national talent.† ""úEvery game is exciting, and especially if we play at home, especially against a good team such as Stanford, we can really see where we are, where we stand right now, and we can see what we have to work on,""ù Zeller said. The second goal came from a header by Stanford defender Keegan Hughes off a corner kick. An unlucky deflection off the back of Windisch sent the ball in a direction that Zeller could not redirect his position in time to catch.† Despite the loss, the Gauchos held a very tight game with the No. 5 Division 1 team in the nation and now look to use their experience in the Big West Conference opener against UC San Diego on Sept. 28.

""úI really enjoyed getting to know all the players and how they play. We were in sync but are still trying to figure out how to play together.""ù Even in the hostile environment of an away game, the UCSB ice hockey team was able to pull out a win.

(Nexus File Photo) Wednesday night's conference opener for the UCSB men's soccer team was a battle of the defenses. The Gauchos ""î a team averaging 2.18 goals a match ""î were limited to one goal in their win over the UCSD Tritons. The Tritons are a defensive-minded team, only conceding 8 goals in 9 matches ahead of the contest, which made scoring opportunities difficult for the Gauchos. To add insult to injury, the team was without their leading striker, sophomore Salvador Aguilar, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear. Luckily, head coach Tim Vom Steeg's team has enough depth to cover for any decommissioned starters. The Gauchos had difficulty finding a way through the Triton defensive line throughout the match but found a breakthrough from red shirt sophomore Lucas Gonzalez ""î who was the dominant playmaker for the Gauchos in the match. Gonzales found sophomore forward Rene Pacheco, who then sent a through ball to junior midfielder Nemo Philipp in the 18-yard box. A Triton defender caught Philipp's leg and brought him down, awarding the Gauchos a penalty. Junior forward Finn Ballard McBride took the responsibility and put enough power on the shot to power it through the outstretched hand of goalkeeper Dominic Peters. The Gaucho defense frequently sacrificed their bodies, stepping in front of shots to alleviate pressure on junior goalkeeper Leroy Zeller. Zeller earned a clean sheet with 3 crucial saves in the second half. The Triton's best chance on goal met Zeller with a fast break at the top of the box and was saved with a quick outstretched leg. His efforts assured the 1-0 win for the Gauchos.† Saturday night's game was an entirely different story. The match was a 4-0 rout of California State University, Northridge that saw the Gauchos at the top of their game in all aspects. Offensive possession and playmaking was clinical, defensive coverage was coolly composed and goalkeeping was impenetrable.† The first goal was a fortunate one for the Gauchos. Pacheco sought to center the ball into the 18-yard box, but the leg of a Matador defender deflected the ball into the near post before the keeper could react for an own goal in the fourth minute of play. McBride showed an excellent display of skill for his solo goal just 3 minutes shy of halftime. McBride orchestrated a flashy spin move at the touch line to pass one defender, avoided a tackle and bypassed another Matador to rocket a tight-angled shot into the top of the net. In the 54th minute, Pacheco received a pass from freshman midfielder Dominick Phanco in the center of the Matador defense and, after one touch, curled a shot into the top right corner from about 20 yards out. McBride netted his brace 20 minutes later after a Matador defender attempted to clear the ball on the goal line. The ball fell into the feet of McBride, who redirected the ball back into the net. He now sits second in the league in goals scored with 6 in all competitions. The Gaucho back four consisting of Jorge Aldana, Henry Davies, Caden Vom Steeg and Timon Windisch played with composure under pressure. Nearly every Matador attack was swiftly stopped with almost a visible swagger. Zeller picked up where his defense fell with 4 saves and a clean sheet on the night. He ranks second in the league for saves and best goals against average. The Gauchos will travel for their first conference away game and will look to continue their undefeated streak at CSU Bakersfield on Oct. 5 at 7 p.m. A version of this article appeared on p. 13 of the October 6, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Stephen Manga / Daily Nexus Before Davis' first season as Gaucho in 2015-16, he was named the Preseason Big West Freshman of the Year by Perfect Game.† Davis was the No. 2 starter in his first year behind pitcher Shane Bieber. Being the No. 2, Davis made 15 starts and a pair of relief appearances, finishing with a 4.46 ERA with over 82 2/3 innings pitched. In those 82 innings, he racked up 63 strikeouts against 30 walks.† Going into Davis' sophomore year, he was listed as the No. 107 starting pitcher in the country in D1Baseball's positional power rankings. That wasn't the only ranking system he would be placed in: Davis was named the No. 70 overall pitching prospect and No. 14 right-handed pitching prospect for the 2018 MLB Draft by D1Baseball.† Davis, UCSB's Friday starter, went 7-4 with a 4.63 ERA with over 13 starts.

On March 19, 2018, it was reported that Davis would likely miss the rest of the season with a partial ulnar collateral ligament tear. At the time, the team was hopeful that Davis would rehab the tear and return at the year's end. However, all hope was lost when he missed the rest of the season from the injury.† Later that year, Davis was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds as the 319th overall pick. Davis spent three seasons with the Reds' rookie minor league team before being traded to the Colorado Rockies. Davis was Class High-A in the Rockies minor league system for two seasons.

In their next game of the season, the UCSB women's soccer team will travel to Fullerton to take on the Cal State Fullerton Titans. This game will be held on Oct.13.

Junior forward Finn Ballard McBride made history with his brace, cracking the top 10 of all-time goal scorers in UCSB history.† The scoring kicked off in the 30th minute when the pairing of redshirt sophomore midfielder Lucas Gonzalez and Ballard McBride combined for Gonzalez's third assist to Ballard McBride this season.† Ballard McBride made a deep run into the box and was found by Gonzalez, where he was able to easily tuck it past the Hornets' goalkeeper, sophomore Mac Learned.†† This game marked the second year in a row the Hornets were shut out by the Gauchos; during the 2021 season the score was 3-0. The Gauchos' first half featured many attacking runs and shots as they were able to gain 5 corner kicks.† The stat sheet featured a dominant game; although the Gauchos won by more in 2021, the stat line showed a closely contested game. In this year's matchup, UCSB dominated from beginning to end, getting 5 shots on goal while the Hornets managed just 2 shots. Junior goalkeeper Leroy Zeller had a quiet game in between the goalposts, as one of the shots on goal was saved, ending the first half. The second shot on goal was quite impressive, as Zeller extended his right leg to keep out the attempt from the Hornets.† In the second half, it was much the same for the Gauchos as they were able to nab a second goal behind the foot of Ballard McBride once again.† This was a goal of skill from Ballard McBride, as senior midfielder Sam Fletcher spotted the forward in the center of the defense where he sent a long through ball. Ballard McBride calmly bounced the ball off his chest and perfectly placed the ball in the back of the opponents' net.† With the 2-goal advantage in hand, the Gauchos did not look back, posting their fifth consecutive shutout. After not scoring in their previous two matches, the Gauchos leaned behind their leading goalscorer of their 2021 season to carry the load.† The Gauchos will go on to face UC Davis before their highly anticipated matchup against rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in a battle between the Gauchos at the top of the Big West table and the Mustangs in the middle of the Big West pack.† By the numbers:† The Gauchos lead the conference in goals allowed with 11 on the season behind a spectacular back line of Gaucho defenders.† Although the Gauchos have had trouble scoring as of late, they still rank second in the conference with 26 goals in conference play. Ballard McBride is still leading the way for the Gauchos and the Big West, being tied for first in conference goals with 8 in the overall season.† Gonzalez ranks tied for fourth in assists in the Big West despite having played fewer games than the players ranking above him.† Zeller is second in the conference in saves, putting together a .804 save percentage across his 14 games played.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the October 20, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Even more impressive was the Gauchos finishing in the top 4 in three of these four races.† Freshman Hazel Derr put up an impressive performance, finishing second in the 100-yard backstroke and first in the 200-yard backstroke. Freshman Samantha Banos nearly beat out her teammate, sophomore Tyryn Empremsilapa in the 100-yard butterfly, but blew away the competition in the 200-yard butterfly, leading the second-place competitor by seven seconds.† The relay teams performed well as the 400-yard freestyle relay ended with the Gauchos taking the top two spots.

After opening October with two winless matches, the Gauchos began a losing streak of two games with a loss at UC Davis. However, UCSB finally eked out their first win since the end of September with a victory against the UC Riverside Highlanders.† (Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus) In their first game of the week, UCSB traveled south to take on the Cal State Fullerton Titans. Tired of their month of suboptimal play, the Gauchos came out aggressive at the start of the first half. Due to their continued early pressure, the Gauchos were able to find the back of the net thanks to a goal from sophomore midfielder Lauren Helwig in the 18th minute. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the lead was short-lived as Cal State Fullerton was able to tie the game at the 32nd minute mark. At the half, the game was tied 1-1. In the second half, the Titans came out with an aggressive form of play not seen in the first. Less than five minutes into the second half, Cal State Fullerton was able to score and take a 2-1 lead. This score did not change for the remainder of the game as the Gauchos were unable to get past the Fullerton defense again.† For their next match, UCSB traveled to Riverside to take on the Highlanders. In this match, the Gauchos had a much more dynamic offense when compared to their previous games. UCSB only had to wait for the 12th minute to open the scoring. The first goal for the Gauchos came courtesy of sophomore forward Manuri Alwis. UCSB was able to fire 2 more shots on goal in this half but were unable to capitalize as they entered halftime with a 1-0 lead. The second half saw a lot more action as 4 goals were scored in total. The first goal of this half saw the Gauchos extend their lead to 2, as Helwig was able to score. However, sloppy defense from UCSB led to the Gauchos conceding a penalty shot, which the Highlanders put away to cut the lead to 2-1. Only seven minutes later, UC Riverside was able to tie the game at two apiece with a goal from redshirt sophomore forward Charisma Benitez. Although hard to swallow, the Gauchos were not shell-shocked as they immediately moved up the field to get the game-winning goal less than four minutes later. This goal was scored by Helwig again: her 3rd goal in two games. UC Riverside attempted to tie the game late but were unable to as the Gauchos held on to secure a 3-2 victory.† As the season winds down, the Gauchos only have two games left in the regular season. UCSB will finish 2022 with home games against UC Irvine and Long Beach State.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the October 20, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

sports,Week 7 NFL preview,25-Oct-22,4:23 PM,['Dylan Harrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-10-25/week-7-nfl-preview/,"The first six weeks of the 2022 NFL season have been more than chaotic. The New York Giants, who went 4-13 last season, have already eclipsed that mark in 2022 with a 5-1 start. Their only loss came to another surprising 2022 team, the Dallas Cowboys. After losing franchise quarterback Dak Prescott after the Cowboys' Week 1 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, backup Cooper Rush inserted life into the team and ripped off a four-game winning streak, bringing the Cowboys' record to an impressive 4-2. On the other hand, two monumental favorites entering the season ""î the aforementioned Buccaneers and the Green Bay Packers ""î have immensely struggled to a 3-3 start. In this article, we will inspect five things to look for in Week 7.††† Photo courtesy of foxsports.com #1: Can the Browns stay afloat? It has certainly been an eventful calendar year for the Cleveland Browns. Following a disappointing 2021 season, the Browns made major changes heading into 2022. They ditched the 2018 No. 1 overall pick, Baker Mayfield, in favor of former Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson. Watson, who missed the 2021 season, was suspended by the league for 11 games in 2022 following numerous sexual misconduct allegations.† Through six weeks, backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett has played solid football. His quarterback rating (QBR) is 10th in the league, and his expected points added (EPA) is eighth. However, the Browns sit at 2-4 and are in the midst of a three-game losing streak. With a trip to Baltimore against their rival Ravens in Week 7, the Browns will need to get back on track to keep their season alive for when Watson returns in Week 13. #2: How good are the New York Giants? To everyone's surprise, the New York Giants have lost just one game through six weeks. First-year head coach Brian Daboll has changed the culture in the Big Apple. His strong-willed, determined style of leadership has brought the best out of his young players. Fourth-year quarterback Daniel Jones is having the best season of his career by far. He ranks 12th in QBR, 11th in EPA and 11th in points above average (PAA).† This week, Big Blue travels to Jacksonville for a tough test against the Jaguars. Despite sitting at 2-4, Jacksonville has given problems to the 6-0 Philadelphia Eagles, shut out the 3-2-1 Indianapolis Colts at home and demolished the Los Angeles Chargers on the road at the SoFi Stadium. Week 7 won't give us a definitive answer but will provide more clarity on how far the Giants can go this season.† #3: Are the Denver Broncos finished? Despite acquiring the $250 million man, Russell Wilson, the Denver Broncos find themselves sitting at an egregious 2-4 through six weeks. Wilson is 26th in QBR, 28th in PAA and 22nd in EPA. Ugly. They get a young, inexperienced New York Jets team at home in Week 7. The Jets don't trust second-year quarterback Zach Wilson, and the Bronco defense ""î which has only allowed over 19 points once this season ""î will likely shut him down. This game is on the shoulders of Wilson and the struggling Bronco offense averaging just 15.2 points a game, which is dead last, 32nd, in the NFL. A record of 2-5 is a death sentence in the modern NFL. If Denver has any chance of salvaging their season, it needs to happen in Week 7.† #4: Will the Dolphins rally around Tua Tagovailoa? The Miami Dolphins were the best team through three weeks. They beat the Ravens, the Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots to start the season. Then disaster struck. The Dolphins' starting quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, hit the ground when he was tackled by a defensive lineman and has since missed the following two games with a concussion, resulting in three consecutive losses for Miami. His impact on the team is unquestionable; he is first in the NFL in QBR and top five in PAA.† Tagovailoa's return in Week 7 on Sunday Night Football against the Pittsburgh Steelers is paramount to the Dolphins' success. His ability to get the ball to his primary playmakers has fostered great success in this offense. Expect him to enter right back into the lineup and the Dolphins to get right back into their winning ways.† #5: Can Jimmy Garoppolo get his revenge?† The best matchup this weekend is the 4-2 Kansas City Chiefs at the 3-3 San Francisco 49ers, a rematch of the 2019-20 Super Bowl. The Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes has been among the league leaders in every single quarterback stat. He is a frontrunner for NFL MVP. On the flip side, 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has been widely impressive since taking over after starter Trey Lance suffered a season-ending ankle injury in Week 2. He ranks eighth in passer rating, ninth in touchdown percentage, and sixth in yards per attempt.† Both first-place teams are coming off disappointing offensive performances resulting in losses. Getting back on track in Week 7 will be paramount for these teams with Super Bowl aspirations. A high-scoring game is likely to come between these two powerhouses, but the winner will leave the week with monumental momentum heading into Week 8.

The team will still maintain the No. 2 position in the Big West Tournament despite the 2-2 tie to the UC Irvine Anteaters and the 4-1 loss to the Highlanders. The No. 2 spot assures a first round bye that will see the Gauchos directly through to the semifinals.†  The Oct. 26 match against the Anteaters was a makeup game that was postponed due to weather on Oct. 15. Junior midfielder Finn Ballard McBride added 2 more goals to his impressive season and moved into 4th all time scorer with 31 goals. Ballard McBride took the responsibility for the penalty earned by sophomore defender Pablo Figueroa and faked the Anteater goalkeeper with a stutter step. His brace came from a precise through ball from junior midfielder Nemo Philipp which he shot across the face of goal into the left side of the net. McBride converted 2 of the team's 4 shots on goal, but were limited to 11 overall compared to the Anteaters' 16.† The defense was pounded by the Anteaters' attack who had 10 shots on goal. Junior goalkeeper Leroy Zeller impressively made 8 saves, but ultimately let 2 through ""î one off a free kick and the other from a rebounded shot. The team's defensive woes continued into Saturday, Oct. 29, where they conceded more goals in one game than the rest of their conference games combined ""î amazingly, that total was only 4. The first 2 goals for the Highlanders mirrored the Anteaters' in the game prior ""î a set piece and a rebounded shot ""î highlighting some weak points in the Gaucho defense that previously tied the school's shutout record. Zeller has been impressive with his saves throughout the season, but when he is tasked with a difficult stop that can't be trapped, the back line needs to be quicker in taking back possession and clearing the ball from danger.† The offensive was more lively in the match despite the result. The Gauchos outshot the Highlanders 17-10 with 10 of them on goal but failed to convert any of them. The team encountered a similar issue in their 1-1 draw with the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Mustangs. The recent struggle with finishing has prevented the Gauchos from securing a win in the last 3 matches.† The Gauchos have a week to fix their offensive and defensive troubles before their next match on Saturday, Nov. 5, at Harder Stadium. They will play the winner of the quarterfinal match on Nov. 2 between UC Irvine and Sacramento State.

sports,NFL season is getting underway,4-Nov-22,7:34 PM,['Dylan Harrison'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-04/nfl-season-is-getting-underway/,"† It is undeniable that Seattle has exceeded any expectations of them this season. Their quarterback, Smith, who was utterly written off, has not ""úwrote back""ù† ""î a quote Smith used following their Week 1 underdog win against the Denver Broncos. Smith ranks No. 5 in yards per attempt, No. 3 in passer rating and No. 4 in quarterback rating (QBR). And, Smith has been a top-five QB this season ""î there's no doubt about it. However, despite Smith's heroics, the team's first-place standing will not continue. For one, their schedule gets very difficult. Five of their last six games go against teams with a .500 record or better, including the Kansas City Chiefs, 49ers and Rams twice. They are also scheduled to play the Buccaneers and the always-tough Las Vegas Raiders.† † OVERREACTION.† † † Indianapolis Colts quarterback Matt Ryan ranks in the bottom 12 in QBR, passer rating and yards per attempt. He also leads the league in sacks taken and interceptions. He's been horrible. The 37-year-old former MVP looks like a shell of his former self. His inability to move the football downfield has suffocated the Colts' offense. It is time for a change. Colts owner Jim Irsay made this decision almost unilaterally ""î a very rare and somewhat unprecedented move in the modern NFL. Ryan's tenure as a starting NFL QB is over.† † REACTION.† † † No one has been more impressive through the first seven weeks of the season than Philadelphia Eagles' QB Jalen Hurts. His 7-0 Eagles have cemented him at the front of the early MVP conversation. Hurts has improved every season in the NFL; his passer rating is up 20 points, his QBR has increased by 26 points, his sack percentage has lowered and his yards per attempt have increased. Hurts has been a force in both rushing and passing the football.† † What has stood out the most about the Eagles is how resilient they have been. Following an early 14-0 deficit at home against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Eagles battled their way back into the game and defeated Jacksonville 29-21. Since Week 1, they have yet to allow more than 21 points in any of their last five games. With the addition of defensive end Robert Quinn coming over from the Chicago Bears in a trade, the Eagles' defense is only getting better.† † REACTION.†† † † I will never bet against QBs Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers. They have, by far, the best track records of anyone in the NFL. They are two of the three best QBs of the 21st century. However, both have gotten off to extremely shaky starts in 2022. Now at 3-5, the Buccaneers no longer sit atop the NFC South. Their schedule is not easy but neither is facing Brady. They will win the NFC South and reach the playoffs.† † Now, the case for Rodgers and the Packers is a lot harder to make. Their wide receiver core has been despicable throughout the last eight weeks. Dropping passes, running poorly, wrong routes and simple mental mistakes have caused Rodgers to look average. They had a very arduous matchup last weekend in their loss against the Bills but, like we've seen before from Rodgers, you can never count him out. They can still win the NFC North but should sneak into the Wild Card at worst.† † OVERREACTION.† † † Regardless of how this season ends for the green and white, give monumental credit to general manager Joe Douglas for absolutely killing the 2022 draft class. He made three tremendous picks early with lockdown cornerback Sauce Gardner, future elite wide receiver Garrett Wilson and a talented running back in Breece Hall. I can't forget head coach and former 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh for his coaching job thus far. However, the New York Jets will NOT make the playoffs this season. The reason is that QB Zach Wilson is not a good NFL QB. His passer rating ranks below QB Mitch Trubisky in 2022, which is all one needs to know about Wilson. He hasn't looked good. The Jets still has one matchup against the New England Patriots and two against the Bills. They also have games against the Minnesota Vikings, the Miami Dolphins and the Seahawks, all who are above .500. Maybe next year.†

However, the Philadelphia Phillies look to continue their Cinderella story and add a third World Series title to their franchise history.† In Game 1, Astros' pitcher Justin Verlander looked to secure his first win in the World Series after being winless in 8 career starts. Verlander started strong by throwing 3 scoreless innings while receiving some run support from his teammates.† Right Fielder Kyle Tucker supplied the offense with 2 home runs from Philadelphia's pitcher, Aaron Nola in the second inning to break the 0-0 tie.† When it came to hitting home runs, Tucker wasn't finished there. In the third† inning, Tucker hit a 3-run home run, making the score 5-0 in favor of the Astros. The Phillies are not strangers to being down early. Bryce Harper, the National League Championship Series MVP, has led his team out of early deficits to secure a comeback victory.† Third-year Financial Math and Stats major Kevin Alarcon stated, ""úI knew the Phillies would come back. Harper's got that dog in him.""ù Alarcon was, indeed, right about the comeback. In the top of the 4th inning, the Phillies scored 3 runs when rightfielder Nick Castellanos singled in first baseman Rhys Hoskins for an RBI. Third baseman Alec Bohm doubled in Harper and Castellanos for 2 more RBIs, bringing the score to 5-3.† With this momentum, the Phillies' offense didn't stop in the 4th inning. In the 5th, Philadelphia tied the game at 5-5 when catcher J.T. Realmuto doubled in outfielders Brandon Marsh and Kyle Schwarber for two RBIs. From there on, it became a bullpen game. Four consecutive scoreless innings led to no action until the 10th inning. Going into extra innings, Realmuto broke the tie in the 10th inning. On a 3-2 pitch, Realmuto hit a solo shot home run toward the opposite field to put the Phillies ahead.† Looking to secure Game 1, Phillies' manager Rob Thomson brought in his closer, pitcher David Robertson.† Going into Game 2, the Astros looked to strike early again after letting 6 unanswered runs beat them on Oct. 28.† The Astros wasted no time, hitting 3 consecutive doubles on 4 pitches to bring the score to 2-0, in favor of them. Two outs later, a throwing error against shortstop Edmundo Sosa allowed another run to score, making it 3-0 for the Astros.† Later in the game, third baseman Alex Bregman added some insurance runs by hitting a 2-run home run to make the score 5-0 in the 5th inning.† The Phillies' offense did not go scoreless. Philadelphia brought across 2 runs, one in the 7th inning and one in the 9th inning. However, Astros' pitcher Framber Valdez pitched a spectacular game, going 6 innings and giving up 4 hits, 1 run and 9 strikeouts, earning the win. Astros' closer, Ryan Presley did not record the save since the margin was too significant, but did record 3 outs in the 9th inning to bring the series to a 1-1 tie in the best of 7 games. Going into Game 3, third-year economics major Isaac Moisa provided his thoughts on the World Series. ""úThe Phillies are trying to become the third NL [National League] East team in the last four seasons to beat the Astros in the WS [World Series], but they're going to need more offensive contribution from guys besides Harper and Realmuto if they want to have a chance against Houston's pitching depth.""ù Game 3 will be held in Philadelphia on Oct. 31 at 5:03 p.m. PST.

But in this matchup, the Elbees outplayed UCSB and ultimately came out on top.† ""úWe knew each other's strengths and weaknesses pretty well. It was just a matter of who did it better, who attacked [the other team] better,""ù senior goalkeeper Evann Smith said. Neither team scored in the first half, with both sides playing with elite physicality. Two minutes into the second half, however, CSU Long Beach senior forward Lena Silano scored a goal and put the Elbees up 1-0. With eight minutes remaining in regulation, UCSB sophomore midfielder Lauren Helwig took advantage of a well-placed pass from sophomore defender and midfielder O'Callaghan Liu and used her head to bounce the ball past the CSU Long Beach goalkeeper, scoring the Gauchos' only goal of the game. The game consequently went to overtime, and because of a rule change in collegiate soccer, teams now play two 10-minute halves in overtime, as opposed to the previous ""úgolden goal""ù rule where the first team that scored won. This modification would have worked in the Gauchos' favor, since Silano scored again for the Elbees in the first minute of the overtime period, but UCSB was not able to respond and gave CSU Long Beach their first victory of the Big West Championship tournament. ""úAt the end of the day, we just have to score and we have to keep goals out of the net,""ù Smith said. ""úSadly, we couldn't do that yesterday, but I do think that we put our whole entire heart onto the field and we left it all out there, so I can't say anything negative about our performance.""ù While UCSB will not advance to the Big West semifinal with the loss, qualifying for the tournament as the No. 5 seed in itself was a victory. Before they won 3 games straight to end the season, UCSB's conference win-loss-tie record was 1-3-3. At that point in the season, making the playoffs seemed unlikely, but the Gauchos remained resilient and defied the odds stacked against them. ""úWe weren't supposed to be here,""ù Smith said.

sports,No. 11 Gauchos seal an upset win against No. 8 Anteaters at home,8-Nov-22,5:57 PM,['Isaiah Ochoa'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-08/no-11-gauchos-seal-an-upset-win-against-no-8-anteaters-at-home/,"The Gauchos were coming off a two-game losing streak from Princeton and UC Los Angeles on Saturday.†  After a highly intense game, the No. 11 UC Santa Barbara men's water polo team went point to point with No. 8 UC Irvine for three quarters. The Gauchos punched it open in the fourth quarter to seal the upset victory.† The Anteaters did strike first with the 1st point on the board, but the Gauchos did not go without a fight. Senior center Sam Nangle, being savvy, created a vast open space for a slam dunk from the center in the 4th minute of the first quarter. Outsmarting the UCI defense, Nangle evened the score at 1-1, but not for long. One minute later, senior driver Ryan Brosnan followed up his teammate by launching an absolute banger from the outside on a power play to put the Gauchos up 2-1. Unfortunately, a minute after Brosnan's goal, UCSB's sophomore center Dash McFarland committed an exclusion, creating a power play for UCI. UCI, taking full advantage, scored 15 seconds into the power play, where sophomore attacker Ethan Shipman found the back of the net.† Vigorous efforts in the cage kept the score count low in the first quarter, leaving the score tied at 2-2 going into the second quarter.† Going into the second quarter, UCI struck first again when sophomore attacker Dylan Patist gave his team a 3-2 lead with seven minutes remaining in the second quarter.† From there on, the point advantage went back and forth from both teams for the remainder of the first half.† Freshman defender Luke Redoutey, sophomore defender Shane Hoover and senior attacker Logan Sutter scored in the second quarter, bringing the score to a 5-4 lead in UCSB's favor when the halftime whistle was blown.† In the third quarter, the defense was the name of the game. Offensive attacks from both teams did not faze UCSB's senior goalie Danny Roland nor UCI's sophomore goalie Jacob Pyle. By the end of the quarter, only 2 goals were scored. On a power play, UCI's senior attacker Zlatan Nikocevic tied it up at 5-5 with seven minutes remaining. However, four minutes later, UCSB's freshman attacker Colton Gregory broke the tie with the ball hitting the back of the net. By the end of the quarter, the Gauchos' major asset on defense, Roland, had chalked up 12 saves.† As the game and clock continued to wind down, both teams looked for a spark to blow it up to seal a win. For the Gauchos, senior center James Oriskovich was that spark they needed. Oriskovich, coming off the bench, did an outstanding turn-to-shoot combo from the center in the 1st minute of play in the fourth quarter, where senior attacker Mason Chambliss was credited for the assist.† From there on, it was all Gauchos. Senior attacker Tommy Hawkins and McFarland led successful offensive attacks to blow it up to a 10-5 lead favoring UCSB.† With the final whistle going off, UCSB capped off the weekend with an 11-6 win. This win marked the first time UCSB has defeated a higher-ranked opponent this season.† UCSB has three more games remaining in the regular season, beginning with a road game at No. 15 San Jose State on Oct. 29 at 1:00 p.m.

UC Santa Barbara broke through in the second overtime and secured a 2-1 victory and is consequently moving onto the Big West Finals.††  The scoring was kicked off in the 28th minute, thanks to junior midfielder Nemo Philipp. After drawing multiple fouls in the first half because of his reliable dribbling skills, Philipp was able to earn a free kick. The crafty lefty was able to set up and place the free kick from 23 yards out into the top right corner.† In the 42nd minute of the match, the Gauchos had another great chance in the second half as senior defender Henry Davies forced a solid save out of the UC Irvine's goalkeeper, sophomore Luke Pruter.†† †Despite the Gauchos' success in the first half of the game, the Gauchos stumbled during the second. With much of the midfield being dominated by the Anteaters, they were able to control a majority of the possession. The Gauchos felt the absence of senior midfielder Sam Fletcher and subsequently weren't able to control the attacking third of the pitch. After a slew of shots in the second half from UC Irvine, they were finally able to equalize in the 57th minute of the match. Outshooting the Gauchos 12-0 in the second half led to a breakthrough from graduate student forward Robert Mejia. A cross from sophomore midfielder Francesco Montanile was met with a powerful header from Mejia into the back of the net.† In the 62nd minute, UC Irvine sophomore midfielder Samuel Atiye took a shot from just outside the box that warranted a full-stretch save from the UCSB sophomore goalkeeper Leroy Zeller.† Much like their first meeting in the regular season with UC Irvine, UCSB gained the upper hand in the match before losing a majority of the possession. Unlike their first meeting, UC Irvine and UCSB weren't able to score again in regular time, forcing the match to go to overtime.†† Just before the end of regulation, sophomore defender Caden Vom Steeg looked to be taken down inside the edge of the box, but UCSB was ultimately only awarded a corner kick for the Gauchos. Finally, with just over a minute to spare in extra time, Vom Steeg sent in a cross from the right side of the field that took a flick from redshirt sophomore midfielder Lucas Gonzalez's head before deflecting into the back on the net off of a player on UC Irvine.† In the final moments of the game, UC Irvine sent in a cross that found the head of an Irvine player, but was easily held by Zeller in goal.† A final kick from Zeller ended the game and sent UCSB onto the finals of the Big West tournament.† The Gauchos are looking to repeat as champions and will have to go to UC Riverside to complete the task. UCSB last lost to the Highlanders on Oct. 29 to cede the Big West No. 1 seed. The Big West championship will take place at UC Riverside on Nov. 12 at 7 p.m. A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the November 10, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Nexus File Photo UCSB also faced off against Pepperdine University, and while the school does not have a men's swim team, the Gauchos beat Pepperdine's women's team by a commanding 221.5-39.5 final score. The Tritons performed exceptionally well against UCSB in their last matchup ""î both of UCSD's teams won by significant margins in 2021 ""î but UCSB was determined to bounce back against their rival, and this year they did so in an impressive fashion. ""úYou can just tell by our record ""¶ this year as compared to last year; we just came to win this year,""ù sophomore Austin Sparrow said. ""ú[UCSD is] also a very, very fast team and very competitive with us, but we wanted to show that we were the better team this year and hopefully [will be] for years to come.""ù While the team experienced a collection of individual successes throughout the meet, such as sophomore Matthew Driscoll and freshman Nina Statler's respective first-place finishes in the 50-yard freestyle, the team's triumphant relays are what ultimately secured a victory for the Gauchos. Sparrow, Driscoll, junior Sean Gutowski and sophomore Justin Wong, won the men's 400-yard freestyle relay with a time of 3:00.51, in addition to Gutowski, Wong, Driscoll and senior Alec Cullen also placing first in the 200-yard medley relay. The UCSB women's 400-yard freestyle relay, which placed first against the Tritons in 2021, was victorious for the second straight year. The group, consisting of Statler, sophomore Tyryn Empremsilapa, junior captain Reagan Nibarger and freshman Samantha Banos, finished with a 3:26.84 time, outswimming last year's relay by four seconds. ""úOur relays have been really strong,""ù Nibarger said.

""úIt doesn't matter who touches the wall, if it's me or a friend or any of my teammates. All that matters is that Gauchos are scoring points for the Gauchos.""ù Like most other collegiate sports teams, UCSB swimming requires a supportive, convivial team culture to be successful. One measure the organization takes to maintain a sense of camaraderie between swimmers is to combine the men's and women's practices, as opposed to keeping the two teams separate for training. ""úA lot of practices on other collegiate teams are split between men and women ""¶ but we don't do it like that,""ù Nibarger said. ""úWe have the women race the men, the men race the women and so on, and it's just a very strong team dynamic where the men and women are able to race and cheer on each other and encourage each other.""ù After Saturday's meet, the men's team holds a 2-0 win-loss record, while the women similarly stand at 2-1.

Senior center Ila Lane led the charge in the second quarter, scoring a team high of 7 points in the second quarter.† Following the second quarter, the third quarter produced much of the same results, as the Gauchos were able to end the quarter with a 59-43 lead which they would hold until the end of the game.† The performer of the night was Lane, who dominated in the paint, putting up a double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds. Even more impressive was Lane picking up 7 offensive rebounds and shooting above 50% from the field.† Off the bench, sophomore point guard Callie Cooper had an impressive all-around performance, having a team high of 2 steals, along with 6 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists.† The squad will take on Pepperdine next on Nov. 10 at home for Fansgiving.

Returning starters, sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell and senior forward Miles Norris showed their experience on the court. Norris put up an efficient 21 points on 9-11 shooting. Mitchell had a rough shooting day going 3-10, but still had a major impact putting together a double-double with 10 assists and 10 points.† There will be room for improvement for the Gauchos as the bench only managed to score 4 points on 1-5 shooting.

""úI think we're playing the best water polo we have all season, so we're just trying to finish off the regular season on a high note and keep that momentum going into the tournament.""ù The Gauchos' position to succeed in the playoff tournament hinges on the team's performance against Pepperdine, as well the results of the matchup between California State University, Long Beach and UC Irvine. The top-two seeded teams after Saturday's slate of games will earn a first-round bye: a highly sought-after week off from water polo to rest and prepare. UCSB currently sits in a three-way tie for the No. 1 spot in the conference with Pacific and CSU Long Beach, but the Gauchos are ranked third of the three teams because of their low goal differential.† Pacific has already claimed one of the top two spots with its Nov. 11 victory over San Jos√© State University. However, if UCSB defeats Pepperdine and CSU Long Beach falls to UCI, the Gauchos will claim the second seed. Although the Gauchos have won three straight games, securing a first-round bye will not be easy. Pepperdine is the team's rival, and while UCSB won 16-13 against the Waves in 2021, matchups between the two teams usually carry an extra layer of ferocity. ""ã""ù[UCSB and Pepperdine] historically do not like each other, and there have been very physical games in the past with each other,""ù Hawkins said. ""úEspecially because it's their senior day, they're going to be fired up for the game, and we're just going to match the intensity.""ù The Gauchos will face off against Pepperdine in Malibu at noon.†

Senior attacker Spencer Wood set to score. (Joela Rodriguez / Daily Nexus) UCSB played well for the majority of the game, practicing a strong defensive technique that limited the number of Pepperdine shots, as well as communicating on offense and working well as a unit. After three quarters, the Gauchos led the Waves 9-7. In the fourth quarter, however, UCSB slowly let Pepperdine creep back into the game. A combination of defensive miscues and controversial penalty calls from the referee ultimately provided the Waves with an opportunity to score a game-winning goal. ""úEveryone [on Pepperdine] was ready to go,""ù senior goalkeeper Danny Roland said. ""úIt was their senior day, they had a lot of high energy and I think they just wanted it more than we did, and that got the best of us.""ù Luckily for the Gauchos, the loss did not impact their playoff seeding. Because California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) won its Nov. 12 matchup against UC Irvine, the Gauchos still would have ended up in the No. 3 spot had they defeated Pepperdine. The game did succeed, however, in changing UCSB's mentality for the playoff tournament. The Gauchos are favored in their first game against a winless San Jose State University (SJSU) team, but if they make it to the second round, the Gauchos will be considered underdogs.† ""úIn a way, this Pepperdine loss was almost a good thing for us, for our team,""ù Roland said. ""úBecause now we can kind of go into the tournament with a chip on our shoulder ""¶ showing that we have something to prove.""ù A shift in mentality is not a new concept for the Gauchos.

UCSB won 71-63 behind an early first half run and late rally to put a hold on Pepperdine's shot at a second half comeback. Angie Banks/Daily Nexus In the first half of the game, it was all UCSB. The Gauchos got off to a hot start, out scoring the Waves 15-7 in the opening quarter. Behind the contributions of six different Gauchos, UCSB was able to move the ball around to find open looks. The first quarter was controlled by senior center Ila Lane who contributed to more than a third of the scoring, going 2-for-2 from the field. Freshman guard Jessica Grant contributed with a 3-pointer. Junior guard Alyssa Marin and sophomore point guard Callie Cooper dished out assists as they assisted on 5 of their first 6 field goals.

sports,The Gauchos make their first fall on the road,22-Nov-22,11:16 AM,"[""Gabriel O'Brien""]",https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-22/the-gauchos-make-their-first-fall-on-the-road/,"The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team falls to 2-1 on the season as they lose to the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks in their first away game.† Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus After more than two scoreless minutes following the tip-off, the Lumberjacks started off the scoring with a 3-pointer by redshirt senior forward Nik Mains. This opening shot set the tone for the Lumberjacks for the rest of this game, in which 18 of their 63 points ""î or 29% ""î came from 3-pointers. For the entire first half of the game, the Gauchos kept it close with solid defense and consistent offensive performances on the whole. On the defensive side, Gaucho graduate student and forward Andre Kelly earned 4 rebounds in the first half alone, with 7 total on the game. On the offensive side of the ball, sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell put up 7 free throws. Mitchell would put up 18 points that night ""î leading the team ""î but the scoring was spread out around the squad for the first half. Unfortunately, there were no standout performances. The Gauchos would only score one 3-pointer in the first half, compared to four from the Lumberjacks. With just over four minutes left in the first half, the visiting Gauchos had a 19-18 lead on Northern Arizona University (NAU). However, the Lumberjacks scored 8 points that remained unanswered when the time expired, and this aggressive shooting skewed the score in the first half in favor of the home team. The halftime seemed to be a refreshing one for the Gauchos, though, and there was some renewed hope for the away challengers, as they reclaimed the lead of 27-26 with 8 unanswered points of their own ""î four of which were scored by senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis, who would go on to have a stellar 17 by the time the night was over. However, the lead for the Gauchos was short-lived, as junior guard Jalen Cone and redshirt sophomore forward Carson Towt combined to put up 10 of 12 straight points for the Lumberjacks ""î forcing UCSB to dig themselves out of a double-digit deficit, with the score at 27-38 with only 11:07 remaining. As only about a half of the second period of play remained, the Lumberjacks maintained their lead with a strong offense and an aggressive defense that was not afraid to foul. For the remainder of the time, the Lumberjacks put up two more 3-pointers, several layups and a dunk ""î as well as 10 personal fouls. While the Lumberjacks defended their lead, the fouls slowed down any last ditch efforts that the Gauchos could possibly make happen with measly 1-point free throws. Indeed, 21 of the Gauchos' 54 points were at the free throw line, which says something about the static tempo of the game and the difficulty that UCSB faced on the road. The final score this Friday was 54-63 in favor of the NAU Lumberjacks. Guards Mitchell and Pierre-Louis combined for 35 points. The 6-foot-10-inch senior forward Miles Norris put up two 3-pointers with a total of 11 points for the night. Norris is new to the Gaucho squad, having played before for the University of Oregon Ducks and starting his college career with the City College of San Francisco Rams. While the loss is a setback for the Gauchos, the team had some strong performances to be proud of going forward in the season.

sports,From free throws to fiction: UCSB basketball alum publishes second book,23-Nov-22,2:57 PM,['Alex Levin'],https://dailynexus.com/2022-11-23/from-free-throws-to-fiction-ucsb-basketball-alum-publishes-second-book/,"Until his second season playing basketball at UC Santa Barbara, JD Slajchert had no intention to pursue a career in literature.  Now, six years removed from his collegiate athletic career, Slajchert has published two novels ""î his most recent, ""úDarling, You're Not Alone,""ù was released on Nov. 3. Slajchert never flourished as a writer for his classes, but to escape from the perpetual intensity of Division 1 basketball, he would occasionally sit down to write letters to friends. After one of his biggest fans, a 10-year old with sickle-cell disease named Luc Bodden in his high school hometown of Oak Park, passed away on Sept. 14, 2016, Slajchert began to write more and more, and his letters ultimately developed into his first book.†† ""úI just sort of had this pretty seismic shift in my life where I wanted to do more than just be an athlete, and so I started writing,""ù Slajchert said. ""ú""ã""ã[I] spent days of my life instead of studying, I was just writing, and it became this really cathartic healing experience to the point where it was all I wanted to do.""ù In his novels, Slajchert has drawn from real-life experiences to create stories that are fictional and surround heartbreaking issues. His first book, ""úMoonFlower,""ù is about sickle-cell disease; Slajchert's inspiration to chronicle the topic stemmed from his relationship with Bodden. The idea for ""úDarling, You're Not Alone""ù originated from Slajchert's close friend's parents, who were both shot during the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas in 2017. They have since made full recoveries, but the tragedy prompted Slajchert to write about a similar event. ""úI think it has to be talked about more. I think it's ridiculous that it's a part of our lives,""ù Slajchert said The novel follows 15-year-old protagonist Phoenix Iver who survives, what is, in the novel, the worst school shooting in U.S. history while living in the fictional town of Darling, Colorado. Iver struggles with social anxiety and depression and, throughout the book, is forced to cope with them before and after the shooting. Iver receives comfort from his ultra-positive father and best friend Herman Iver, who, in another subplot, mysteriously changes careers from police officer to school security guard, which Iver aims to learn about as the story progresses. ""úThe worst part of humanity, to me, is a school shooting, but this book also contains what I think is the best part of humanity, too,""ù Slajchert said. ""ú""ã""ãI want people to walk away with the idea that if really bad things can happen, that we all know about and talk about, then so too, must equally as good.""ù In both of his books, Slajchert has written about issues that are notably heavy, between the trauma that follows a school shooting and the suffering that accompanies a child with sickle-cell disease.† Slajchert noted that writing two separate novels that involve serious material was entirely purposeful and that he prefers to write stories about poignant subjects that are typically less talked about. ""úI feel like if I'm going to dedicate so much time to something ""¶ it should not only be a good story and a good fictional novel, it should also shine a light on something maybe we didn't know a lot about,""ù Slajchert said. ""úMaybe someone out there who is going through a tough talk can read this book, and it'll help them ""¶ that makes it all worth it to me.""ù After finishing ""úDarling, You're Not Alone,""ù readers are encouraged to take part in the very thing that launched Slajchert's career as a novelist: letter writing. In the back of the book exists the #YoureNotAlone Letter Writing Campaign, which asks readers to write a letter to a loved one with the first sentence reading, ""úYou're not alone,""ù followed by a short paragraph describing why the reader cares about the loved one or what the loved one means to them. ""úIt's not so difficult to just write someone and say ""òHey, you're not alone' and maybe two or three sentences, but it can make a really big impact on someone's life in a good way,""ù Slajchert said. ""úI think there's real power in that.""ù ""ú""ã""ãThe hope would be that if you write to someone and give them that message, then they can then go and write to someone too and it can kind of create this ""¶ mission for good in a small way,""ù Slajchert continued. ""úAs a writer, I think you fall in love with the small things, and this is just sort of my small mission of trying to make the world a better place.""ù ""úDarling, You're Not Alone""ù is available to read on Amazon, and is linked on Slajchert's website.†

While at Huntington Beach, Davis did not leave shorthanded: Davis was a First Team All-Sunset League selection, named First Team All-State and All-County and won the 2015 California Interscholastic Federation-Southern Section Division I Championship. Noah Davis throws a pitch. Dustin Harris / Daily Nexus Before Davis' first season as Gaucho in 2015-16, he was named the Preseason Big West Freshman of the Year by Perfect Game.† Davis was the No. 2 starter in his first year behind pitcher Shane Bieber. Being the No. 2, Davis made 15 starts and a pair of relief appearances, finishing with a 4.46 ERA with over 82 2/3 innings pitched. In those 82 innings, he racked up 63 strikeouts against 30 walks.† Going into Davis' sophomore year, he was listed as the No. 107 starting pitcher in the country in D1Baseball's positional power rankings. That wasn't the only ranking system he would be placed in: Davis was named the No. 70 overall pitching prospect and No. 14 right-handed pitching prospect for the 2018 MLB Draft by D1Baseball.† Davis, UCSB's Friday starter, went 7-4 with a 4.63 ERA with over 13 starts. Davis threw over 81 2/3 innings while striking out 65 against 22 walks. Davis then proceeded to go to the Cape Cod Baseball League in the summer. In the Cape Cod Baseball League, Davis played for the Cotuit Kettleers. While there, he made five appearances with 4 starts. Davis pitched 16 innings with a 2.81 ERA, striking out 12 against 7 walks. A successful summer added another accomplishment to the trophy case for Davis. In the prestigious summer league, Davis earned the No. 23 prospect in the Cape Cod League by D1Baseball. For the 2018 season, Davis was named the ace again with similar prospect rankings as the previous year. D1Baseball named Davis the No. 53 college prospect for the 2018 draft. D1Baseball also listed him as the No. 63 starting pitcher in the positional power rankings.† Unfortunately for Davis, his junior season was cut short due to injury. On March 19, 2018, it was reported that Davis would likely miss the rest of the season with a partial ulnar collateral ligament tear. At the time, the team was hopeful that Davis would rehab the tear and return at the year's end. However, all hope was lost when he missed the rest of the season from the injury.† Later that year, Davis was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds as the 319th overall pick. Davis spent three seasons with the Reds' rookie minor league team before being traded to the Colorado Rockies. Davis was Class High-A in the Rockies minor league system for two seasons. In his second season with the Rockies, he was promoted to Class AA for 26 games.† On Sept. 16, 2022, Davis was called to the MLB for the Colorado Rockies. Davis has not made his MLB debut, but he will be available as a multi-inning option out of the Rockies' bullpen.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the September 29, 2022 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The scores of the three sets were 25-19, 25-20 and 25-18 in favor of the UC Santa Barbara women's volleyball team.† Anige Banks/Daily Nexus In set one of the game, UCSB rolled out with their usual starters to set the tone early. The Gauchos' game plan worked as the game was 7-2 early on for the Gauchos. Senior setter Megan Shimoda looked to provide a spark as the first one off the bench.† Shimoda did just that, helping score 2 points to make the score 9-2, as she served an ace and assisted freshman right-side hitter Julia Shepherd on a kill.††† It's an understatement to say that the Gauchos controlled the whole first set. At no point during the first set did UCSB look flustered or nervous. The CSUN Matadors did attempt to make it interesting with a run that cut the lead to 3 points on multiple occasions. However, the Gauchos were so in sync that they scored the final 3 points to secure the first set. In the second set, the Gauchos kept the momentum going by jumping to an early 8-2 lead. As the set continued, the Gauchos never looked back, securing a 25-20 win in the second set. Going for the sweep, the Matadors were not trying to go home early or without a set win. CSUN was keeping it close, with the third set being tied midway through at 11-11. Unfortunately for the Matadors, the Gauchos pulled away with 6-straight points, making the score 17-11. UCSB clinched the sweep by winning 25-18. The Gauchos continued their homestretch at the Thunderdome by hosting the University of Hawai'i on Nov. 25 for their home finale. The matchup was an exciting one where it went to a 5-set nail-biter going Hawai'i's way. In the first set, UCSB came out of the gates hot again by taking an early 5-1 lead. However, Hawai'i would not go down without a fight by tying the score at 23-23. Fortunately, the Gauchos prevailed with the help of senior right-side hitter Tallulah Froley and junior outside hitter Michelle Ohwobete on back-to-back kills. In the second set, Hawai'i continued to put together good runs of play leading to an early 8-4 lead. It was evident that the Rainbow Warriors did not want the Gauchos to gain more momentum, causing them to make only 5 errors in the set. Hawai'i would eventually win the set 25-20, tying the game. Hawai'i continued their momentum for the third set by going up 13-5. UCSB wasn't going down with a fight, as they battled to 24-24. The Gauchos secured the third set 28-26 with 3-straight points thanks to an ace and kill from sophomore middle blocker Niableu Correal and a kill from junior right-side hitter Tasia Farmer.† Going into the fourth set, the Gauchos looked to secure the win while Hawai'i tried to force a fifth set. The set went point-for-point as the score was 13-12 in favor of Hawai'i, before their run. After UCSB scored a kill from UH junior outside hitter Kendra Ham, Hawai'i went on a run to make the score 23-15 at one point. Hawai'i successfully forced the fifth set, winning 25-18 in the fourth. In the final set, no team gave leeway as they went point-by-point again. By the middle of the set, the score was all tied up 7-7 until Hawai'i's freshman outside hitter Caylen Alexander had something to say about it. Alexander scored back-to-back kills to give Hawai'i the lead, and they never looked back.† UCSB tried to cut the deficit but errors propelled Hawai'i to the 15-11 victory.† UCSB finished its season with a 20-10 record and a 16-4 record in the Big West Conference. With this loss, the Gauchos said goodbye to their seniors: Froley, Shimoda, setter Mehana Ma'a, outside hitter Sophie Messinger, middle blocker Kristina Pepek and middle blocker Deni Wilson.

sports,"Michigan trounces Ohio State in 118th year of ""úThe Game""ù",4-Dec-22,6:44 PM,"[""Gabe O'Brien""]",https://dailynexus.com/2022-12-04/michigan-trounces-ohio-state-in-118th-year-of-the-game/,"One of the most longstanding rivalries in college football, and in fact all of American sports, took place this Saturday, Nov. 26, as the Michigan Wolverines squared off against the Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus, Ohio for the annual matchup of the Big Ten powerhouses. The competitiveness between Michigan and Ohio State runs deep, but this season so much more was on the line than mere bragging rights for both the teams and the players. Rick Osentoski / USA TODAY Sports Going into ""úThe Game,""ù as it has been colloquially referred to for generations, the number 3 ranked Michigan Wolverines, under Coach Jim Harbaugh, and the number 2 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, under Coach Ryan Day, were both undefeated at 11-0. Only the defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs were ranked above them. This particular game was crucial for both teams to win, since the victor would go on to the Big Ten Championship. And though the Buckeyes were an 8-point favorite to win on Saturday, the Wolverines would once again win ""ì and advance to the conference championship for the second straight year. In the first quarter, both teams looked rather stagnant. Ohio State began the scoring with a 12 play drive that resulted in a touchdown pass from Heisman contender C.J. Stroud. Indeed, the Buckeyes defense managed to slow down any early gains that Michigan could make in the first quarter ""ì which ended with a 10-3 score, in which Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy was limited to just 48 yards passing. But halfway through the second quarter, a significant momentum shift occurred. It was a third down at their own 31 yard line, and the Wolverines had already had trouble converting all game. After the snap, McCarthy dropped back and was in trouble throwing what looked like a desperation fade away pass to wide receiver Cornelius Johnson. Johnson could have been stopped short of getting the first down, but with one swift juke, he evaded the defender and took the ball all the way to the end zone to tie the game at 10-10. If this wasn't enough to leave the home team in Columbus shocked, the very next offensive outing for Michigan was a one-play, 75 yard bomb from McCarthy to Johnson for a touchdown once again, to which announcer Gus Johnson remarked: ""úThey said the kid couldn't throw the deep ball.""ù While deep passing was an obstacle for McCarthy early in the season, he would put that behind him on Saturday by throwing for 263 yards and three touchdowns, and even running for a touchdown himself. Though the half ended with Ohio State in the lead 20-17, after Stroud connected with Marvin Harrison Jr. in the end zone, the game was set to be an even match up. At the end of halftime, the Wolverines were energized to retake the lead ""ì which they would never give back. Michigan would dominate time of possession in the 3rd quarter, scoring one touchdown, and their defense would force punts from the Buckeyes both times the home team was on offense. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Ohio State cut the lead to one score, at 31-23, with a field goal by Noah Ruggles. In the hopes of keeping Ohio State on their toes, the QB-led shootout between the two teams was cut short, as Michigan started relying more on the running game in the final quarter. After Ohio scored, Michigan had yet another one play drive, as running back Donovan Edwards took an inside handoff, permeated the Ohio State offensive line, and took the rock all the way to the end zone to make the score 38-23. Time was running out in the game, but Ohio State had one last chance to pull something off as they reached the red zone on the next drive. But the pressure from the defense got to Stroud, who scrambled on third down, and blindly tossed the ball right into the hands of Wolverine edge rusher Taylor Upshaw. After this turnover, Donovan Edwards sealed Ohio State's fate, by once again breaking free on third down for an 85 yard rush for a touchdown. After yet another pick by Stroud, whose running for the Heisman Trophy arguably ended this game, the Wolverines knelt out the clock to win 45-23. What should have been a close game between two undefeated Goliaths, turned into an embarrassing rout of Ohio State ""ì with the Michigan players waving goodbye triumphantly to the disheartened Buckeyes fans. The reaction of UCSB football fans to the game was one of general surprise and commendation. Third year theater major, Holden Overbeck stated: ""úGoing into the game, I was sure Ohio State would win, it was almost a sure thing.""ù But Overbeck stated that by the second half, when Michigan really started to roll, he couldn't believe how the game turned out. Fourth year film major Troy Cochrane, who grew up in Michigan, was complimentary of the ""údepth""ù on the Wolverines bench. Although the typical starter for the position is Blake Corum, the standout star of Saturday's game was clearly running back Donovan Edwards ""î who ran for two touchdowns, and 216 yards from 22 carries. Cochrane said Edwards's performance was ""úimpressive,""ù and that he is ""úexcited to see this player shine in only his second year.""ù The aftermath of the Michigan-Ohio State game has left a lot of questions leading up to the College Football Playoff, with some wondering if the once titanic Buckeyes will even make it to the series. And now it seems that the team with the best shot to beat the Georgia Bulldogs can be none other than Michigan. All of these questions will be answered on Selection Day, December 4, when the official rankings for all of college football will be released.

Graduate and sophomore guards Ajare Sanni and Ajay Mitchell led the offensive attack with a combined 41 points.† Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexus The Gauchos won the tipoff and broke the scoring open with a layup from Sanni. However, the Tigers kept it close by making five out of 10 3-pointers and forcing eight turnovers. Fortunately, UCSB ran away with a lead after a TV timeout going on an eight-point run. UCSB went into the half leading 37-29 after senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis scored a buzzer-beater.

Norris continued his scoring ways from the first half, finishing with 18 points. Kelly made his presence known by recording 11 rebounds, four being offensive. Kelly also scored 11 points giving him the only double-double of the game.† After the game, we talked to coach Joe Pasternack about the early free-throw struggles. Pasternack stated, ""úWe came here this morning at 9:20 a.m. And each guy was at a basket, and they shot for about five minutes while the other guys on the team watched film and then we flipped it. And so I don't know what the answer is because we have really, really good shooters.

Joshua Yepez Martinez / Daily Nexusball After the game against the University of Pacific, Head Coach Joe Pasternack talked about closing games and putting the other teams out of reach. ""úI thought at the end of the game we were fatigued, and we didn't block out and rebound and we fouled. I thought we played guys a lot of minutes, but you know at the end of the day we competed at a championship-level on defense. And that's what you can ask for, but not happy with our rebounding gave up 15 offensive rebounds, which we were the number two in the country defensive rebounding before the game, and we let up, we totally let up, we played the score. You can't play the score in college basketball,""ù Pasternack said.† The Gauchos made the adjustment coach Pasternack was looking for in the victory against the San Diego Christian Hawks. The Gauchos dominated the game from the start putting up a 48-22 lead going into the half. They controlled the boards gaining 39 rebounds to the Hawks 15 and gaining 13 offensive rebounds as opposed to 7 from San Diego Christian. The Gauchos also played a good brand of defense, committing just 11 fouls throughout the full 40 minutes, playing a season high 16 players on the roster. The bench came alive in their opportunity in the blowout game outscoring the opponents bench by a score of 49-17. One of UCSB's top recruits nationally ranked in the 2022 class, freshman forward Koat Keat Tong performed to his ability adding a team-high 5 rebounds, an assist and a block. UCSB moved on to take down Portland State University on the road in their 85-73 victory. This match featured another breakout game for the star point-guard sophomore Ajay Mitchell. After a tough shooting stretch to start the season, Mitchell had backed it up with shooting the three balls consistently better. Against Portland, he did not manage a 3-pointer made in his single attempt but managed to score 25 points on an efficient 10-17 shooting from the field, while also adding 7 rebounds and 5 assists. Senior forward Miles Norris put together a quiet double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds, making 8-10 from the free throw line. Senior guard Calvin Wishart provided the spark off the bench by adding 13 points on a perfect 8-8 from the line. Senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis provided the defensive toughness for the Gauchos, racking up 3 steals before fouling out in the second half.† The Gauchos move on to face a talented Appalachian State University. This is a team that took down perennial powerhouse University of Louisville and lost by one to a Wake Forest University team who already have taken down a ranked Duke program.† The key to slowing the Appalachian Mountaineers will be containing the 3-man trio of senior forward Donovan Gregory, graduate student point-guard Tyree Boykin, and sophomore guard Terence Harcum. The combined scoring of these three reaches slightly above 30 points per game. As for the rest of the team, the assists and rebounds are evenly distributed, showing a balance of play from an experienced Appalachian State team. The Gauchos will take on the Mountaineers on Wednesday, Dec. 21 in Phoenix for the Jerry Colangelo Classic invite tournament.

The Bruins would go on an 18-to-10 run where they would seal the second-set victory at 25-16.† Both teams were battling for every point they could have in the third set by running all over the court and not letting the play die. UCSB would keep it close to UCLA, forcing back-to-back attack errors, making it 7-5 in UCLA's favor.† However, UCLA had other plans. The Bruins controlled every part of the set; they would take the third set with a score of 25-14, wrapping up the Asics Invitational. The numbers didn't lie, as UCLA completely controlled this game through hitting percentage, blocks, digs and aces. The two most substantial team statistics were UCLA's hitting percentage at 42% compared to UCSB's 8%, and UCLA's 7 blocks. Sophomore setter Jack Walmer would finish with the most digs on the team at 6 digs, and 19 assists throughout the match. Bianchi and freshman outside hitter Ben Coordt would tie each other on the night for most kills on the team, with 6 apiece to their name. The two would have an ace under their name as well. The Gauchos look to move past the Asics Invitational, where they will be on the road next week to Palo Alto to take on Stanford University.††

""úIt's always a great opportunity to see new teams.

""úFinally getting to play someone else is really exciting.""ù The team has placed an emphasis on the defensive side of the ball this season.

""úI think building off of last year, one thing that we're really focusing on with this year's 2023 team is just team chemistry,""ù Clemons said.

Senior forward Miles Norris contributed to the early scoring, providing back-to-back 3-pointers. The Matadors responded with a run of their own, going on a 12-6 run.

Wright and junior forward Dearon Tucker continued the scoring after the break, each adding a basket to reduce the Gauchos' lead to 1 point at 34-33.

Sophomore guard Cole Anderson lit fire from behind the arc, knocking down two straight 3-pointers at the 11:34 mark to put the Gauchos up 47-38.

UCSB's Coach Joe Pasternack stated after the game about the bench effort, ""úYeah, yeah, I mean [senior guard] Calvin [Wishart]† ""î† 6 assists, 1 turnover ""î did a great job. I thought our whole team found Cole Anderson, and it's like we got to find him in transition. Ajay found them in the second half.

And in transition, 18 assists, man, that's great.""ù Sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell once again had a stellar stat line of 18 points and 6 assists.

The Eagles will host the 49ers and the Chiefs will host the Bengals after each were victorious in their divisional matchups. In the first matchup on Jan. 21, the Kansas City Chiefs were able to take down a young Jacksonville Jaguars squad 27-20 led by their second-year quarterback Trevor Lawrence. The match had a scare mid-game when star quarterback Patrick Mahomes' ankle was hurt by an opposing player. Backup quarterback Chad Henne was able to come in for a drive and lead the Chiefs to a touchdown. The Chiefs were able to hold on to a one-touchdown lead in their victory with a hurt Mahomes.† ""úHonestly, I'm not stoked. Ever since watching my Chargers collapse to the Jags, football hasn't been the same,""ù third-year economics major Ben Kessler said.†† Many NFL fans shared the same feeling about the second game of the day. In the night game, the Philadelphia Eagles provided a snoozefest for the fans as they dismantled a struggling New York Giants defense in a 38-7 blowout victory.† A week after the Giants quarterback Daniel Jones had a masterclass performance, it seemed he couldn't get anything going against a stout Eagles defense, throwing for only 135 yards and adding an interception to his line. The Eagles' quarterback Jalen Hurts had a near flawless game, with two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown. Jan. 22 marked the start of the following games. The first matchup was another blowout, with the Cincinnati Bengals taking care of the Buffalo Bills 27-10. In the debate between quarterbacks Joe Burrow and Josh Allen, Burrow has come out on top once again, beating his counterpart by throwing for 242 yards and two touchdowns in their victory. Bills star receiver Stefon Diggs was barely featured in their loss, catching just four passes for 35 yards. In a snowy affair throughout the game, some have wondered if the weather played a factor. The final game of the weekend featured a defensive affair, featuring the San Francisco 49ers hosting the Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers defense prevailed in the match, coming out with the 19-12 victory. There was questionable play from the Dallas Cowboys' quarterback Dak Prescott, as he threw two interceptions, with one resulting in a 49ers touchdown in the ensuing drive. Tight end for the 49ers George Kittle provided the biggest impact on the field for the team, catching five passes for 95 receiving yards. The Cowboys were kept in the game with dynamic plays from their wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, racking up 117 yards. ""ú[What an] action packed weekend. Boy, oh boy, was that exhilarating. As a niners fan, I've never been happier, and I just feel so lucky to get to watch Brock Purdy huck the pigskin for another week after that big win,""ù fourth-year communications major Grant Norma stated after the victory.† Fans should gear up for championship weekend as the 49ers take on the Eagles and the Bengals travel to Arrowhead Stadium to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.

Nexus File Photo The Gauchos entered the weekend ranked No.19 in the nation by the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA). At the Invite, they showcased persistence and elite togetherness across their six dominant performances, in five of which they emerged victorious. UCSB started off the weekend with two games on Jan 20., shutting out Cal State Monterey Bay 14-0 and beating Concordia University Irvine 15-5 in a similarly commanding fashion. The Gauchos then defeated UC Merced with a remarkable 22-0 score on Jan. 21. The Gauchos' next opponent, Indiana University Bloomington, was expected to end UCSB's win streak, given their No. 14 CWPA ranking. However, despite being placed five spots below Indiana, the Gauchos used their momentum from their previous three games to pull off a 13-10 upset victory. ""úWe knew Indiana was going to be one of our toughest games of the weekend, so that was the game [where] everybody needed to come together,""ù redshirt senior utility Caitlyn Snyder said. ""úEveryone was on the same page; everyone wanted to win. I think one of the big things was the momentum in the first quarter [continuing] all the way through ""î everyone was consistent with their playing defensively and offensively.""ù After cruising past Ottawa University 18-6† on Jan. 22, the Gauchos faced UCLA, whom the CWPA ranked No. 3. While UCSB ultimately fell short with a final score of 11-6, the group was able to legitimately compete against a talented opponent, an impressive feat that appropriately concluded an overall successful invite for the Gauchos. ""úI think the UCLA game was a great way to end,""ù Snyder said. ""úObviously we didn't end up winning, but UCLA is an amazing team, and just for us to be only down by one going into the fourth quarter, it was huge to show that we can compete with anyone.""ù Snyder, named a 2022 Division I All-American Honorable Mention, played a pivotal role in the team's success throughout the weekend, totaling 20 goals across their six games. The team also experienced standout performances from sophomore center Imani Clemons, who scored 3 of the Gauchos' 6 goals against UCLA, and redshirt sophomore utility Leigh Lyter contributed 4 points in UCSB's pivotal win over Indiana. While accomplishments from individual players certainly aided the team in achieving a 5-1 win-loss record, the leading factor in the Gauchos' success throughout the weekend was their ability to work as a unit. ""úOur chemistry was good, but now I believe that it's great,""ù Snyder said. ""úWe all have the same goal, and that goal is winning a Big West Championship, and when everyone has the same goal, anybody is willing to do anything to achieve that goal.""ù UCSB players still have a long season ahead of them before the Big West Championship. The team's next challenge will take place from Jan. 27-29 at the Princeton Invite. Coming off a strong start to their season, the Gauchos hope to continue improving and eventually turn their goal into a reality. ""úEvery game you play, win or loss, you're gonna gain something out of it and learn from those things,""ù Snyder said. ""úI think we still have a lot to learn and [there are] more things we can do to improve offensively and defensively, but everybody [is] believing in each other and supporting each other and as long as we continue that, we're going to hopefully reach our goal.""ù A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the Jan. 26, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

After a 3-point jump shot by junior guard Brantly Stevenson, the Mustangs managed to tie the game up at 52-52 with just under 6 minutes left in regulation.† From that point, it was a classic back-and-forth battle between the rivals. With just under 2 minutes left in the game, a foul by Gaucho senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis sent Cal Poly graduate small forward Chance Hunter to the free throw line, resulting in the Mustangs being down by just 1 point. After a quiet first-half performance with just 2 points, sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell came up big for the Gauchos in the second half, scoring nearly half of his points in the last 2 minutes of the game.† A game-changing layup and drawn foul resulted in a successful 3-point opportunity for Mitchell. The Mustangs' battle back into the game was short lived, as they managed to put up just 2 points after Hunter's successful free throw attempt in the last 1:41 of the game.† The Gauchos came out on top for the second time this season in the Blue-Green rivalry matchup, with Norris' 18 points and Mitchell's 16 points leading the team to victory. The No. 1 seeded Gauchos are looking to extend their lead in the Big West this weekend as they head to Cal State Northridge to take on the 5-18 Matadors, who lost their previous matchup against the Gauchos 52-72 in mid-January earlier this year.

With the two wins, the Gauchos have been able to maintain separation in the Big West Conference and hold onto the top spot in the conference standings.†  After losing to the CSUN Matadors in Northridge, the Gauchos stayed on the road to take on the Long Beach State Beach. Early on in the conference matchup, the Long Beach players' size and length was too much to handle for UCSB, as Beach were able to score 43 first-half points, most of which were scored in the paint. Additionally, these points were scored efficiently, as Long Beach State Beach shot a solid 52.9% from the field.† The Gauchos had an active offense as well, as they scored 38 points in the first half of play on 52.9% shooting as well.

It's really hard to do that on the road.""ù Even with an improved defense, the game still went down to the wire, as timely free throws sealed the win for the Gauchos. Free-throw shooting has been a point of emphasis for the UCSB coaching staff.† ""úWe hit some really big free throws at the end, and that was a huge part for us,""ù said Pasternack. ""úCalvin Wishart hit two in a row, and I think we were 13 for 16 after going 0 for 3 from the free throw line in the first half.""ù In the end, the Gauchos were able to hold on and beat Long Beach State by a score of 75-72.

The Aggies were led by junior guard Elijah Pepper, the leading Division I scorer in all of California, who had 17 first-half points. The Gauchos were able to weather the storm by having a spread-out scoring attack. Wishart led UCSB in scoring with 11 first-half points, while Norris had 8. At the half, the Gauchos had a 6-point lead of 38-32. Unfortunately, the lead came with a cost, as freshman forward Koat Keat Tong was forced to exit the game with an injury.† In the second half, it was more of the same, as UCSB was able to score efficiently and increase their lead to hold on for the win. However, at the end of the game, a skirmish between the two teams broke out, as Kelly and UC Davis sophomore guard Ty Johnson were ejected from the game. A day after, the Big West Conference issued one-game suspensions to both Kelly and Johnson. ""úI really don't know what happened,""ù said Pasternack immediately after the game.

This NFL season possessed everything fans could have hoped for: a bevy of heartwarming underdogs, a collection of electrifying rookies and a fantastic season finale that featured the league's two best teams. Drama, emotion and plain-good football dominated the league from September to February, creating a spectacle worth sacrificing Sundays for. Trying to summarize every aspect of this year of football would be impossible, so I have selected five storylines that I believe made the 2022-23 season special. Hats off to Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles for largely keeping pace with Kansas City on the league's biggest stage, creating one of the more exciting Super Bowls in recent history. But between quarterback Patrick Mahomes' unbelievable playmaking and head coach Andy Reid's elite play calling, the Chiefs were nearly unstoppable. Mahomes completed 77% of his passes, threw for 182 yards and tossed 3 touchdowns, finishing the game with a 131.8 passer rating. He also carried the ball six times for 44 yards, including a crucial 26-yard scamper to put Kansas City in range to kick their game-winning field goal. These efforts earned him his second Super Bowl MVP award in four years. On all three of Mahomes' touchdown passes, his wide receivers were wide open, a result of Reid's coaching intelligence. The Philadelphia defense was one of the best in the league this year, boasting playmakers at every level, but Reid knew exactly how to manipulate the unit to his and his quarterback's liking. I fully expect Reid and Mahomes, both future hall-of-famers, to return to the Super Bowl in the near future. By the end of their careers, they could very well rival Tom Brady and Bill Belichick as the best coach-quarterback duo in history. The Jacksonville Jaguars and the Detroit Lions finished the 2021-22 season with the two worst records, obtaining the top two selections in the 2022 NFL draft. One year later, both teams are rife with youth, talent and potential, largely thanks to their head coaches. Doug Pederson took on a franchise that had been severely wounded by Urban Meyer's presence in 2021, and beautifully built an entirely new culture in Jacksonville based on winning and teamwork. He lifted up a team at rock bottom and helped them win a playoff game, earning him the third-most votes for the 2022 AP Coach of the Year award. Similarly, in his second year as the Lions head coach, Dan Campbell used his energy and charisma to lead a franchise with a history of losing to a winning season. After being featured on ""úHard Knocks,""ù the scrappy, underdog Lions were easy to root for in 2022, starting with Campbell's passion and drive to win football games. Campbell could easily bring Detroit its first playoff win since 1991 next season, while Pederson will look to compete with the other AFC powerhouses to send the Jaguars their first ever Super Bowl. Sending their tenured quarterback to Denver on March 16, 2022, could not have gone better for the Seattle Seahawks.† Russell Wilson's absence allowed longtime backup Geno Smith to breakout, leading the Seahawks to the playoffs, making his first pro bowl and earning the 2022 AP Comeback Player of the Year Award. Smith unquestionably outperformed Wilson's dreadful 2022 campaign, whose 4-11 record and 16-11 touchdown-to-interception ratio prompted the firing of head coach Nathaniel Hackett. Quarterback play aside, the trade also gifted the Seahawks a package of high draft picks, allowing them to build for the future. The team's 2022 rookie class shined this season, and the team holds the No. 5 and No. 20 overall picks in the 2023 draft. Time will tell if the newly hired head coach Sean Payton can salvage the Wilson trade on Denver's end, but Seattle's general manager John Schneider has to feel pretty good about the state of his franchise after this season. While one season is not enough time to make any concrete judgements about a draft, there were a great deal of first-year players who took the league by storm in the 2022-23 season. The New York Jets' first two selections, cornerback Ahmad ""úSauce""ù Gardner and wide receiver Garrett Wilson, won the AP Defensive and Offensive Rookie of the Year awards, respectively. Both played like seasoned veterans, with Wilson amassing over 1100 receiving yards and Gardner earning a pro-bowl selection and a roster spot on the AP 2022 All-Pro Team. Two Seahawks rookies also warranted consideration for the rookie of the year awards, with running back Kenneth Walker III shining down the stretch and pro-bowl cornerback Tariq Woolen leading the league in interceptions. Other standout rookie campaigns included New Orleans Saints' wide receiver Chris Olave, Lions' defensive end Aidan Hutchinson and the most surprising rookie sensation, San Francisco 49ers' quarterback Brock Purdy, who surpassed his status as ""úMr. Irrelevant""ù by leading San Francisco to the NFC championship game. Players from the 2022 draft will continue to emerge, but looking at just one year, the future of the NFL looks bright. The scariest sight on a football field is when a player goes down and doesn't get back up. But when Buffalo Bills' safety Damar Hamlin collapsed during the Bills' Week 17 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, anyone watching could feel that this situation was different. Hamlin went into cardiac arrest, prompting nine minutes of CPR to resuscitate him and additional emergency medical care. Hamlin has made miraculous progress in his recovery, delivering a heartwarming speech at the NFL Honors surrounded by the Bills' athletic training staff. But when his condition was still unstable and unknown to the public, the entire NFL community ""î players, coaches, trainers, executives, journalists and fans, among others ""î assembled to share love and prayers for Hamlin. There was no discussion of anything else football-related while Hamlin was fighting for his life in the hospital ""î no game picks, playoff talks or fantasy analysis ""î only messages of positivity and hope for Hamlin's well being. Many donated to Hamlin's charity, The Chasing M's Foundation Community Toy Drive, which has now raised over $9 million. The extensive love for Hamlin did not feel artificial or performative; it felt real. The circumstances, while frightening, were a powerful example of how the millions of people involved with the NFL in some way can rally around a cause to create positive change.

sports,Women's basketball win propels coach Henrickson to 100th win,21-Feb-23,5:19 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-02-21/womens-basketball-win-propels-coach-henrickson-to-100th-win/,"The UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team took home the comfortable victory against UC Davis 77-64. This win for the Gauchos marked the 100th win for head coach Bonnie Henrickson, as she became just the third head coach at UCSB to reach this milestone. This win was significant as it gave the Gauchos a two-game lead over the Aggies in the standings, as a loss would've put UCSB behind UC Davis. Nexus File Photo After the first quarter the Gauchos held a small lead ""î 15-12 ""î despite outshooting the Aggies by a significant margin. The second quarter is where the Gauchos got it going, as they took a 37-24 lead headed into the half. The Gauchos were shooting 7-15 with 3 turnovers as a team, while Davis shot 4-12 from the field with four turnovers. Junior guard Alyssa Marin provided the hot hand in the quarter totaling 7 points in 3 minutes of court action. Sophomore forward Alexis Whitfield put together an equally impressive quarter, adding 10 points shooting 3-3 from the field and 4-5 from the line. The third quarter was similar to the the second quarter as the Gauchos continued to score at a high rate. Following the end of the third, the Gauchos jumped out to a 67-44 lead. Sophomore point guard Callie Cooper came in hot in the third and didn't look back, converting all of her shots from three, two, and the line, leading to a quarter-high 11 points. Senior guard Alexis Tucker continued an impressive all-around game with 5 defensive rebounds and 2 assists in the third.†† The fourth quarter did not align with the Gauchos' impressive day, as they were outscored 20-10. The team shot 1-9 from the field in the fourth, while turning it over seven times. The Gauchos' 3-point defense remained stout as they were able to hold the Aggies to 1-6 from three in the fourth and 5-25 in the entire game. In the match, Cooper and senior forward and center Ila Lane ended up being the leading scorers at 14 points apiece with Whitfield not far behind scoring 12 points. Tucker produced a quiet double-double with 11 points and rebounds. The Gauchos strongest stat in the game was their free throw percentage, hitting 27-32 free throws. One area the Gauchos would like to improve is the turnovers, as they had 17 as opposed to the Aggies' 10. The Gauchos will travel to Irvine next to take on the Anteaters on Feb. 15. This will be a key game for them as UC Irvine would be tied with the Gauchos if they lost on Wednesday night. In their last matchup, the Gauchos were unable to slow the guards of Irvine with sophomore Hunter Hernandez and junior Diaba Konate putting up 14 points each with over 50% from the field. The keys for the Gauchos to come out with a victory will be to control the boards as they did in their previous matchup against the Anteaters. UCSB will also have to shoot better from the 3-point line as they shot just 5-16 in their previous matchup. The Gauchos will look to move into a tie for second place in the Big West with a win on Wednesday night.

They scored 2-2 in the 4 games they played. The Gauchos faced off against Minnesota, New Mexico and Oregon State throughout the weekend.  In Game 1, the Gauchos were the home team of the exhibition against the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Junior pitcher Mike Gutierrez would be the starting pitcher for the Gauchos. Gutierrez, unfortunately, gave up a pair of hits which caused Minnesota to hit a sacrifice fly to score one. Gutierrez escaped any further damage, leaving the score 1-0 in favor of the Golden Gophers.† Gutierrez forgot about the unideal start fast as he retired 10 straight batters, giving his offense a chance to tie and take the lead at any given time.† After some dominant pitching from Gutierrez, the offense came through in the 4th inning as junior infielder Nick Oakley hit a triple down the right-field line to clear the bases and take the 3-1 lead.† The Gauchos continued to pour it on as freshman infielder Corey Nunez, sophomore outfielder Ivan Brethowr and redshirt junior infielder Jonah Sebring earned RBIs to make it 6-1.† Minnesota would not go down quietly as they scored six consecutive runs in the 6th and 7th inning. The Golden Gophers' rally pushed them ahead 7-6 headed into the bottom of the 7th inning.† UCSB responded quickly as Brethowr hit a home run to left field to tie the game up at 7. Sophomore outfielder LeTrey McCollum and Oakley followed up with their teammate as McCollum hit a single, and Oakley doubled him in to make 8-7 Gauchos. The Gauchos added another run to their total before freshman pitcher Hudson Barrett would go out in the ninth to try and notch the save.† The Gauchos continued to pour it on from there as they scored every inning from the 5th to the 9th. The score was 13-2 as freshman pitcher Frank Camarillo secured the last out on the mound.† The Gauchos won 9-7 with Barrett earning the save and redshirt sophomore pitcher Brady Huddlestun earning the win. Starting pitcher Gutierrez went 5 innings pitched, allowing 2 runs, 5 hits and 8 strikeouts. For Game 2, the Gauchos were the home team again against the New Mexico Lobos, where sophomore pitcher Matt Ager started for the Gauchos.† Both offenses were quiet until Ager found himself in trouble in the 3rd inning. The Lobos loaded the bases before they hit a 2-run single to make the score 2-0. New Mexico added another on a wild pitch making it 3-0 before Ager struck out the next 2 to end the inning.† Ager got comfortable again as he held the Lobos scoreless for the next 3 innings as the score remained 3-0 heading into the 7th inning. Redshirt senior outfielder Broc Mortensen then put the Gauchos on the board in the 7th as he hit a home run to center field.† The score remained the same for the rest of the game as the Gauchos lost 3-1, and Ager went for 6 innings, 4 hits, 3 runs and 10 strikeouts.† In Game 3, freshman pitcher Reed Moring started for the Gauchos as they played as the away team against Minnesota.† The Gauchos striked first as redshirt junior outfielder Jared Sundstrom hit a 3-run home run bringing in Oakley and Brethowr, making it 3-0. The Golden Gophers responded quickly as they hit their home run, but it was only a 2-run making it 3-2.† Moring went 3 innings, 3 hits, 2 runs and 2 strikeouts but did not win, as Huddlestun earned his second win of the classic. For the last game of the classic, it was a game to forget the Gauchos. UC Santa Barbara played Oregon State as the visitors, with freshman pitcher Tyler Bremner on the mound for the Gauchos.† Bremner had a rough opening college start as he gave up 8 runs in the first 3 innings as the Gauchos went down 8-0 going into the fourth. The Gauchos ran out of steam on the offensive side as well, as they had some chances but didn't capitalize on them. The game ended early due to the NCAA run rule, giving the Gauchos a 11-0 loss. The Gauchos finished 2-2 in the classic, where they showed flashes of being a great team. After this, they headed home for the home opener against the Oregon Ducks on Feb. 25.†  A version of this article appeared on p. 8 of the Feb. 23, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

On Friday, the Gauchos' starter, junior pitcher Mike Gutierrez, escaped a mess early in the first inning as he stranded a runner on third with 1 out. Junior infielder Nick Oakley helped his teammate by making a SportCenter Top 10 play. Oakley looked like he shot out of a cannon as he made a diving play to save a run.† Two innings later, the Gauchos struck first as sophomore infielder Zander Darby hit a no-doubt home run to right field to score himself and teammate junior infielder Jonah Sebring, making it 2-0. The Ducks threatened to score the next inning as they had runners on first and third base with 2 outs. Gutierrez defeated the threat by striking out the next batter looking to leave the score 2-0.† The Ducks soon found a way to score as they hit a 2-out RBI single to score one, making it 2-1. Gutierrez limited the damage by striking out the next batter swinging. The Gauchos provided insurance runs for the relief pitchers as sophomore outfielder Ivan Brethowr hit a grand slam down the left field line, scoring Darby, Sebring and freshman infielder Corey Nunez, making the score 6-1.† The Gauchos took the opener of the series with the score of 6-2 as Gutierrez finished five and one-third innings pitched, allowing 6 hits, 1 run and 6 strikeouts and earned his first win of the season.† In the doubleheader, the Gauchos dominated on Saturday. In the day's first game, sophomore pitcher Matt Ager threw 6 innings, allowing 2 hits, no runs, 9 strikeouts and his first win. The Gauchos struck first as sophomore catcher Aaron Parker hit a single to make it 1-0 in the second inning.† The long ball continued as junior outfielder Jared Sundstrom hit a solo home run in the fourth, extending the Gauchos' lead to 2-0. UCSB played well on both sides of the game, as Oregon only had 2 hits throughout the whole game and didn't score a single run. The Gauchos continued to pour it on the Ducks as they scored 10 runs to win 10-0. Sundstrom and Parker had 3 hits each and 2 home runs each as they combined for 5 RBIs.† In the final game of the series, the Gauchos looked for the sweep as freshman pitcher Reed Moring took the mound for the Gauchos. Moring held the Ducks scoreless in the first first inning, allowing his offense to strike first on the day again. Darby put the Gauchos on the board first, hitting a sacrifice fly to score junior catcher John Newman, Jr.† The Gauchos added some insurance runs as sophomore outfielder Justin Trimble got into one in the fourth inning. Trimble hit a 2-run home run making it 3-0 in favor of the Gauchos. Moring later allowed his first run of the game off a double in the fourth inning but ended the fourth inning up 3-1.† Moring continued to work in later innings as he went six and two-thirds of innings pitched, 5 hits, 1 run and 6 strikeouts, earning his first win of the season and his college career. The Gauchos completed the sweep with a score of 4-1. UCSB outscored the Ducks 20-3 on the weekend, making them look like a threat this season as Oregon is ranked No. 20 while the Gauchos are unranked.† The Gauchos look to head home for their home opener against Xavier University for a 3-game series March 3-5. First pitch times are set for 5:05 p.m. Friday, 4:05 p.m. Saturday and 1:05 p.m. Sunday.

In Game 1, the Gauchos started hot as they scored 4 runs in the 1st inning. Freshman third baseman Bella Fuentes, senior infielder Hannah Damore, freshman utility Jazzy Santos and senior infielder Korie Thomas each earned an RBI in the inning. Junior pitcher Camryn Snyder went out the next inning and pitched with a lead as she put up another zero on the board for the Gauchos, keeping the momentum on their side. The Gauchos stayed hot as they scored 2 more, with Fuentes earning another RBI. The score was 6-0 going into the 3rd inning.† The Thunderbirds responded in the 3rd inning by scoring 2 off of Snyder, making the score 6-2 in favor of the Gauchos. Snyder escaped the inning without giving any more runs to Southern Utah. The Gauchos responded by putting up 4 runs in the bottom half of the inning, making it 10-2 in favor of the Gauchos. Junior infielder Chloe Stewart, senior outfielder Sam Denehy and junior infielder Madelyn McNally earned RBIs.† Snyder held the Thunderbirds scoreless for the 4th and 5th inning, earning her the complete game win and a Gauchos win. Going into Game 2 of the doubleheader, sophomore pitcher Ava Bradford held Southern Utah scoreless in the top half of the inning, but the Gauchos went on the score in the bottom half.† The Gauchos took full advantage of the Thunderbirds' mistakes as they scored 2 runs off an error, making the score 2-0 in favor of the Gauchos.† The Thunderbirds responded immediately as a pair of doubles in the 2nd and 3rd inning, tying the game at 2-2.

Sullivan held the Thunderbirds scoreless and won by getting 4 strikeouts and only allowing 1 hit. On Saturday, Feb. 18, the Gauchos looked to complete the sweep at home with freshman pitcher Malaya Johnson on the mound. The Gauchos again struck first as Mogan hit a sacrifice fly to bring in Damore to make it 1-0 for Santa Barbara. Southern Utah responded, and they scored 2 unanswered runs in the 3rd inning to give them the 2-1 lead.† Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the Thunderbirds continued to score after the 3rd inning as they scored 2 more in the 5th inning after a 2-run home run. After 5 innings, the Gauchos were down 4-1 going into the 6th inning.† Santa Barbara cut the deficit and tied it in the 6th inning after some key singles. Stewart hit a single to score McNally and Newsom to make it 4-3 in favor of the Thunderbirds. The Gauchos didn't stop there, as a single from Donaldson scored Stewart to tie it 4-4 in the bottom half of the 6th inning.

The Gauchos beat the University of Northern Colorado 9-1 and San Jos√© State 9-4 but lost to Sacramento State 7-6 and twice to Santa Clara University, 9-4 and 7-0, respectively.† Dustin Harris/Daily Nexus The Gauchos started the invitational playing Sacramento State as junior pitcher Camryn Snyder started in the circle for the Gauchos. Snyder had a tough day. Sacramento scored every inning Snyder pitched as she only pitched three and two-thirds, allowing 10 hits, 6 earned runs, 5 strikeouts and 1 home run. Snyder's teammates tried to mount a comeback in the later innings as a two-RBI single from freshman pitcher Malaya Johnson brought the score to 7-4 in favor of Sacramento State. The Gauchos scraped one more run across before losing 7-6. The Gauchos returned to the field to face off against the Santa Clara Broncos, with Johnson taking the circle for the Gauchos.

The Anteaters are 5-2 and the Gauchos are 6-1 in their last seven games.† The entire first half of the game was a back-and-forth battle between both teams with the largest deficit being 6.† Following the injury of freshman forward Koat Keat Tong and suspension of graduate forward Andre Kelly after getting into a scuffle in his previous matchup with sophomore guard Ty Johnson of the UC Davis Aggies, redshirt junior forward Jakov Kukic got the start for the Gauchos for the first time this season. Kukic did not hesitate to make his presence known as he finished the first half as the Gauchos second leading scorer with 8 points, shooting 4 for 5 from the field. Heading into the locker room, the Gauchos were on top 35-33 with none other than sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell as the team's leading scorer with 15 points, and junior guard DJ Davis as the Anteaters' top leading scorer with 15 as well. Entering the second half of the game, a layup by sophomore center Bent Leuchten of the Anteaters tied the game 37-37 at the 18:18 minute mark. This would be the last time the Gauchos would have a lead or be tied with the Anteaters. The largest deficit was 11, as the Anteaters were on top of the Gauchos 66-55 with under five minutes left in regulation. Despite the Gauchos cutting the double-digit deficit to 7 with under three minutes left in the game, a mix of both ball handling by the Gauchos and the Anteaters' shocking 5 offensive rebounds quickly put the Gauchos in crunch time.† A jump shot by sophomore guard Cole Anderson at the 2:52 minute mark would be the last time the Gauchos put up points the entire game.† The Gauchos rarely got their hands on the ball in the final three minutes of the game. UCSB head coach Joe Pasternack was looking for a shot clock violation to be called but never received it, resulting in both benches conflicting with each other.† The Anteaters would go on to win the game with a final score of 70-59 with Davis as the team's leading scorer with 25 points, followed by junior guard Dawson Baker with 14 points. Despite the loss, Mitchell had one of his best performances all season, tying his season high of 25 points. No other Gaucho finished the game with double-digit points as both Kukic and senior forward Miles Norris were the team's second leading scorers with 8 points each.† The Gauchos and Anteaters are now tied for first place in the Big West as both teams are 11-3 in conference games this season.† Kelly will be back in action for the Gauchos this weekend as they head to UC Riverside to take on the 17-10 third-place Highlanders who previously took down the Gauchos in mid-January of this year with a final score of 65-64.

With the two wins, the Gauchos are currently in a three-way tie for the Big West regular season crown with two games to go.†  In the game that ended the losing streak for the Gauchos, UCSB took on the Long Beach State Beach in the Thunderdome on Feb. 23. With injuries to key players like freshman forward Koat Keat Tong, senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis and graduate guard Ajare Sanni, head coach Joe Pasternack's squad had eight scholarship players available for their match with the Beach. Even with an undermanned team, the Gauchos were able to hold on and win with a final score of 78-73. ""úOur players had an incredible amount of urgency,""ù said Pasternack after the win. ""úWhen you only have eight scholarship players ""¶ you kind of look to your right and to your left and you say ""òWe're drowning right now.' To be able to win in college basketball there is no margin of error and we have a minus-100 margin of error. You just have to have such an incredible amount of urgency in everything you do, every single possession. I thought our guys just did an outstanding job, and I think it's one of the best wins of the season under the circumstances.""ù At the beginning of the game, the Gauchos struggled to stop Long Beach from driving to the basket and scoring, as the Beach shot an efficient 58.6% from the field. By shooting at such a high percentage, Long Beach was able to score 40 first-half points and head to the locker room with a 2-point lead at halftime. While the Beach were still able to shoot at 53.6% in the second half, they were unable to hit any of their 3-point attempts, which allowed UCSB to eventually outpace their opponents. ""úThey shot 56% tonight, so I don't know how many stops we actually got,""ù said Pasternack. ""úBut what I will say is they only got 6 offensive rebounds, and that's their biggest strength. They are one of the top-five rebounding teams in the country. I thought our guys really really battled for boards. [Senior forward] Miles Norris got seven rebounds. I thought he did a magnificent job rebounding the ball.""ù The Gauchos were led by sophomore guards Ajay Mitchell and Cole Anderson, who had 28 and 18 points, respectively. Mitchell added 6 assists and 4 rebounds, while Norris finished with 16 points and 3 assists. ""úI just give the credit to my teammates to just keep finding me,""ù said Anderson. ""úObviously I was missing the last game, and I started off kinda rough tonight but I'm gonna keep shooting because that's what everyone tells me to do and I know I'm a great shooter.""ù† After the victory, the men's team traveled to San Diego to take on the UCSD Tritons.The Tritons, who recently transitioned to Division I play, had a signature win one game before their matchup with UCSB: an upset win over the conference-leading UC Irvine Anteaters. However, UCSD could not hold onto the magic for this game as UCSB was able to pull away in the second half to win 87-71. In the first half of the game, the Gauchos were led by Norris, who went 7 for 7 and 18 first-half points. However, UCSB struggled on the defensive side of the ball, as they entered halftime with only a 4-point lead. The Gauchos shot 56.7% for the half, while the Tritons shot 53.3%.† The second half was a different story for the Gaucho defense, as they held UCSD to only 33.3% shooting while continuing their hot pace. UCSB was able to keep up their pace and did not let up until the final whistle as they outscored their opponents 47-35 in the final half. In this match, the Gauchos were led by Norris, who finished with 25 points and 4 rebounds, while redshirt senior guard Calvin Wishart flirted with a triple-double by putting up 15 points, 8 assists, and 6 rebounds.† For their next game, UCSB will stay on the road to take on the UC Davis Aggies. It will be the first meeting between the two teams since an 84-74 UCSB victory on Feb. 11 that saw UCSB graduate forward Andre Kelly and UC Davis sophomore guard Ty Johnson get into a fight with each other, leading to a one-game suspension for each player. The game will be on March 2 and will be able to be streamed on ESPN+.

Unfortunately, UC Santa Barbara's women's basketball fell to Hawai'i 68-58, wrapping up the regular season. The Gauchos will have the No. 5 seed in the Big West Tournament and face UC Davis in their first matchup.† Maddy Fangio The Gauchos started hot as senior guard Alexis Tucker made a mid-range jump shot. The Gauchos exchanged buckets with the Rainbow Warriors throughout the first quarter.† The Gauchos scored 18 points in the first, giving them a 1-point lead going into the second quarter with a score of 18-17. UC Santa Barbara lost the lead at the start of the second quarter.† Choice retook the lead after she knocked down a three to make the score 23-21 in favor of the Gauchos. Shortly after, Hawai'i hit a three of their own, taking the 23-24 advantage for the Rainbow Warriors.† Hawai'i extended their lead to 6 points before going into the locker room for halftime. At the half, the Gauchos found themselves behind 23-29.† Coming out of the locker room, the Gauchos looked to cut the lead and try to regain the lead again. In the first five minutes of the third quarter, the Gauchos cut the lead down to 1 point after junior guard Alyssa Marin hit all her free throws after a technical foul was awarded, making it 34-35 Hawai'i. With two minutes left in the third, Choice knocked down a three to tie it at 42-42. Hawai'i extended their lead to end the third quarter 43-46. In the fourth quarter, Hawai'i extended their lead to as much as 9 points with two minutes left in the game.

Choice scored 23 points off 9-14 from the floor while going 4-6 from three, with 4 rebounds and 1 assist. Tucker also hit double digits, scoring 18 points from 5-11 shooting, including 2-6 from three with 7 rebounds and 2 assists.† Marin and senior center Ila Lane combined for 14 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists.† As the regular season has concluded, UC Santa Barbara finished with the fifth-best winning percentage in the Big West this season.

The Gauchos are set to play against the No. 4 seed UC Davis in the quarterfinal round on Wednesday, March 8 at 2:30 p.m. pacific time. The game will be live on ESPN+.

By tying UC Irvine for the regular season title, the Gauchos were able to clinch the No. 2 seed in the Big West tournament. This is critical for the Gauchos, as their only way into March Madness is winning the Big West tournament outright. Maddy Fangio The Gauchos secured their win Saturday night behind a route from the start to finish against conference rivals, Hawai'i by a score of 81-61. Ten minutes into the game, the Gauchos developed a solid 10-point lead 23-13. The paint defense of the Rainbow Warriors was exposed as 12 of the first 23 points were scored in the paint by the Gauchos. By the end of the first half, the Gauchos had a commanding 46-26 lead, behind senior guard Calvin Wishart's 15-point first half. Not far behind him was senior center Andre Kelly and sophomore guard Cole Anderson with 8 points apiece. The second half remained much the same for the Gauchos, keeping a sizable lead for much of the second half.† Senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis got it going early in the second half scoring the 5 of the Gauchos first 7 points after the break. The scoring was well distributed throughout the second half, with the Gauchos sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell sharing the rock around to his teammates.† Mitchell finished the game with a double-double of 10 points, 11 assists and 5 rebounds. Senior forward Miles Norris and Kelly joined Mitchell in that category, picking up double-doubles of their own. Norris gathered 10 rebounds and finished with a team-high 18 points. Kelly managed to grab 10 rebounds and add 12 points in the paint. In the 81-61 victory, Anderson and Wishart provided the hot hand from behind the arc, shooting a combined 7-11, attributing to a combined 29 points in total. Late in the game, the crowd got to its feet as Head Basketball Coach Joe Pasternack gave each of the senior starters a sendoff with late game substitutions. Pasternack embraced each of the seniors, Kelly, Pierre-Louis, Norris and Wishart, as each were making their way off the Thunderdome court for the last times in their career. Leading the charge to end the season was Mitchell, who averaged the most points per game at 15.7 and assists per game with 5.1. Norris followed right behind Mitchell with 14.2 points per game and 6.4 rebounds per game. Anderson shot the lights out this season producing a three-point shooting percentage at 41.7 to lead the team. The team's hard work did not go unnoticed, as Pasternack went on the microphone at the end of the season finale to encourage the crowd to stay. Saying that the team was not able to play with the fans in the COVID-19-riddled year, he wanted the crowd to enjoy the ceremony with the team. Pasternack led the crowd into a chant of three ""úGo Gauchos""ù to officially tie a knot on the regular season. The Gauchos look to go dancing in March Madness but will first have to take on the Long Beach State Beach. UCSB is 2-0 against the Beach this season. The matchup will take place March 9 at 6 p.m. at the Dollar Loan Center in Henderson, Nevada where they will start their quest for the Big West Championship.

Nexus File Photo On Friday, March 3, the Gauchos were penciled in to play Wagner College and California Baptist University back to back. The Gauchos started great against the Seahawks, as they were first on the board by scoring 2 runs in the first.† Sophomore catcher Daryn Siegel worked a walk to bring in junior infielder Madelyn McNally. Freshman third baseman Bella Fuentes followed her teammate by hitting a sacrifice fly to score freshman outfielder Makayla Newsom and lead 2-0.† Freshman pitcher Malaya Johnson started in the circle for the Gauchos as she held Wagner College to 0 runs and earned a complete game win. Johnson struck out 5 while only walking 1. The Gauchos scored 3 more runs in the fourth, having the scoring end at 5-0 with a Gauchos win. During the second game of the day, the Lancers struck first on junior pitcher Camryn Snyder. The Gauchos tried turning a double play to get out of the inning unscathed, but it did not go as planned, as the Lancers put one across in the third inning.† UCSB tied it up at one in the next half of the inning. Siegel singled to right field, scoring junior catcher Ashley Donaldson.† California Baptist University responded right away, scoring one in the fourth off a wild pitch and another where the Lancers stole home. The Gauchos racked up 2 hits in the last inning but couldn't mount up enough to tie it in the seventh, giving them the 1-3 loss. On the following day, March 4, the Gauchos were set to face off against Wagner College and California Baptist again. Sophomore pitcher Ava Bradford took the rubber for the Gauchos as they faced off against the Seahawks first. The Gauchos again struck first against the Seahawks as Siegel homered to left field, driving in 2 runs in the third inning. They extended their lead by scoring one in the fifth and one in the sixth to make it 4-0 Gauchos.† Bradford earned the complete game win, only allowing 1 run and 1 walk as the Gauchos swept the Seahawks 4-1.† The Gauchos shortly retook the field to take on the Lancers. Johnson took the circle in seeking to go 1-1 against California Baptist University. All looked well for the Gauchos until the third inning. The Lancers scored all three of their runs in the third by having 4 hits in the inning, two being RBI doubles. The Gauchos responded by scoring one in the fourth when sophomore second-basemen Alexa Sams doubled to bring in Siegel.† The Gauchos went 1-1 for the day and got swept by the Lancers. On the last day of the invite, the Gauchos took the field against Howard University with Snyder in the circle for UCSB. Both teams went back and forth, putting zeros on the board until the sixth inning.† Howard University struck first on a wild pitch to put them up 1-0, which they held for the rest of the game. The Gauchos responded immediately as they strung 6 hits in the inning, while the Bison also made 2 errors. UCSB pushed 6 runs across to give them the 6-1 lead going into the seventh.† Snyder shut it down in the seventh, earning her the complete game win with 7 strikeouts and only allowing 2 hits. The Gauchos went 3-2 in the Lancer classic, and look to get ready for Fresno, California and compete in the Bulldog Classic.

The Gauchos won on Senior Night with a score of 64-50 as freshman guard Skylar Burke set a new career-high in scoring. (Maddy Fangio / Daily Nexus) The Gauchos started the scoring early, as junior guard Anya Choice made her first basket of the day from deep, giving the Gauchos an early 3-0 lead. Senior guard Alexis Tucker led from there as the Gauchos struggled to score a minute after Choice made the three.† Tucker scored the following eight points for the Gauchos as they led 11-5 over the Tritons. UCSD quickly responded as they scored 5 unanswered points to bring the score to 11-10 before the media timeout. Both teams went point to point for the rest of the quarter before sophomore forward Alexis Whitfield assisted Burke in hitting a buzzer-beater three to put the Gauchos up 18-15. Going into the second quarter, the Gauchos maintained their lead by exchanging baskets with the Tritons for almost the entire quarter. UCSB scored at the end of the quarter to extend their lead before heading into the locker room for halftime.† The Gauchos went on an 8-point run to end the half as they led 33-24. The defense was a primary factor for UCSB in the second quarter. The Gauchos held UCSD to 9 points in the quarter on 3-13 shooting from the field.† The third quarter followed the same narrative for UCSB, as they continued to score and not allow the Tritons to have any hope of trying to come back. The Gauchos extended them to the utmost of 18 points with two minutes left of the third quarter. Gauchos lead 48-35 to end the third quarter.††† In the fourth quarter, the scoring frenzy continued for the Gauchos, as Burke hit a milestone in her collegiate career. Burke knocked down a layup, giving senior forward Ila Lane the assist, but the layup from Burke earned her the accomplishment of reaching double digits in scoring for the first time in her collegiate career. Burke converted the and-one following her foul on the layup and scored 2 points later to finish her new career high of 13. Burke also finished with 7 rebounds and 4 assists. Choice was one of the Gauchos that finished in double digits as she finished with 15 points going 5-10 from the field and 2-6 from three. Seniors Lane and Tucker were the last two Gauchos to finish in double digits as the duo combined for 22 points. UC Santa Barbara will play their final home of the season on Thursday, March 2, against the UC Davis Mustangs. Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

On Selection Sunday, it was announced that UCSB was a 14-seed in the South Region and will travel to Denver, Colorado to take on the No. 3 Baylor Bears. Senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis jumps up for an acrobatic finish at the basket. Maddy Fangio/Daily Nexus This is the Gauchos' second appearance in the tournament in three years and the first since capacity restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were lifted. In the 2021 edition of the tournament, UCSB fell to the Creighton Bluejays in a heartbreaking 63-62 loss.† ""úEvery time you play in the NCAA tournament you learn little lessons,""ù said Head Coach Joe Pasternack. ""úI thought our guys did a great job [in 2021]. It was much different than any NCAA tournament that I've ever been associated with because we were in a ""òbubble' and couldn't leave the hotel. It was pretty surreal, but we have a totally different team this year.""ù The team this year that Pasternack spoke of is playing some of its best basketball of the season. After losing three straight games in February and sole possession of the top seed in the Big West regular season standings, UCSB has rattled off consecutive wins against quality opponents. This high-level basketball is what allowed the Gauchos to punch their ticket in the NCAA tournament. ""úWe had a great finish to our season, winning seven games in a row,""ù said Pasternack. ""ú[We] are playing our best basketball at the end of the year. That's what you always hope for as a coach. We've endured a lot of adversity and injuries. We're just excited to get to Denver and enjoy March Madness.""ù A main reason for this late-season success has been sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell. After Mitchell was named the Big West Player of the Year, his dominant play did not let up as he led the Gauchos to the Big West Title and was named MVP of the tournament.† ""úI'm excited to play in this tournament,""ù said Mitchell. ""úIt's been a dream for me. Playing Baylor is also a great experience for us.""ù Mitchell is right in saying playing the Bears is a great experience for him and his team. Baylor had a great year and was consistently ranked in the list of the top 25 best men's basketball squads all season.† ""úBaylor, I mean, first off, coached by a Hall of Famer Scott Drew, a lot of respect for him, always have had,""ù said Pasternack. ""úAnd what he's done from when he took over to now is unbelievable. The talent on Baylor is incredible. I don't think it's just the three guards. I know they get all the hype, but [Jalen] Bridges, what a terrific talent he is, and all three guards I think are all NBA-caliber guards. They're the No. 2 offense in the country.""ù Although the Gauchos respect Baylor, they are not afraid of them. Even as the 14 seed, UCSB knows they can make some noise. ""úI don't think any team cares about seeding,""ù said Mitchell. ""úIt's the NCAA Tournament, it's a big stage, anyone can win. We're just focused on playing our game, having fun, and just competing with the biggest teams.""ù The matchup between UCSB and Baylor will be the first tournament game held in Denver this year. Tip-off is at 10:30 a.m. PST on March 17. If the Gauchos pull off the upset, they will play again on March 19 where they will take on the winner of Creighton vs. North Carolina State.† By the Numbers:† † † † † † † † † Just start making over $600 a day from your timeshare home.

Then, the Gauchos found themselves on the road to play a double-header on March 12 against rival California Polytechnic State University. The Gauchos won all three games, 2-1 against Seton Hall, 12-4 and 8-4 against Cal Poly.Against the Seton Hall Pirates, the Gauchos Friday starter, junior pitcher Mike Gutierrez, was on the mound. Both pitchers dueled back and forth, as the game was scoreless through 4 innings.†  Gutierrez limited the Pirates' offense to 2 hits through 4 innings while earning 4 strikeouts. However, Gutierrez could only hold Seton Hall for so long. In the 5th inning, Seton Hall struck across a run on a solo home run, giving the Pirates the lead. Gutierrez gave up one more hit in the inning but only allowed one run from the long ball. Gutierrez's day was finished after 7 innings, giving up 5 hits, one walk and 9 strikeouts. Gutierrez also won, thanks to his team's comeback in the 7th.† In the bottom of the 7th, sophomore catcher Aaron Parker hit the gap for a double as both runners on base scored, giving the Gauchos a 2-1 lead. Freshman pitcher Hudson Barrett came in for the save, stranding two runners on base and giving the Gauchos the 2-1 win.† The Gauchos then hit the road to Cal Poly after weather complications canceled the next two games against Seton Hall. The cancellation led to last-minute arrangements to play the Mustangs for a double-header. In game one of the double-header, the Gauchos struck first and continued to pour it on in bunches. Junior second baseman Jonah Sebring started the scoring early after an RBI single in the 3rd. The Gauchos kept it moving the next inning by scoring 5 more runs to give themselves the 6-0 lead heading into the bottom of the 4th.† Sophomore pitcher Matt Ager kept the Mustangs scoreless until the 4th, as a single up the middle scored two, making it 6-2 in favor of the Gauchos. Cal Poly added two more against Ager as a single and a fielder's choice made it 6-4 after 5 innings.† Ager ended his day by giving up 4 runs on 5 hits but only allowing 1 walk on 3 strikeouts. Junior pitcher Carter Benbrook relieved Ager and shut down Cal Poly the moment he came in. Benbrook won by going three and two-thirds allowing 1 hit, no runs, and 3 strikeouts.† The Gauchos extended their lead before sealing the win with sophomore pitcher Michael Rice getting the last 3 outs. UC Santa Barbara took the first game 12-4, and they got ready for the next game shortly after.† As the Gauchos looked to push their win streak to 6, the Mustangs had other plans. Freshman pitcher Reed Moring found himself in early trouble by giving up 4 runs in the second.† UC Santa Barbara quickly responded as Parker hit an RBI single, followed by a 3-run home run from senior outfielder Broc Mortensen. After 3 innings of play, the score found itself tied at 4. The game remained tied at 4 until the 9th inning. The Gauchos pushed four runs across, coming off RBIs from Mortensen, Parker, and sophomore outfielder Ivan Brethowr.† The Gauchos look to extend their win streak as they face off against California State University, Bakersfield at home in a 3-game series March 17-19. Game times are set to start at 5:05 p.m., 4:05 p.m. and 1:05 p.m.; all 3 games will be on ESPN+.

In Game 1, UC Santa Barbara faced off against the Utah Tech Trailblazers. The Gauchos got on the board early after junior shortstop Madelyn McNally hit an RBI single to make it 1-0 after 1 inning of play. The Trailblazers responded the next inning, scoring off a wild pitch to tie it at 1-1. The Gauchos retook the lead in the 4th as junior catcher Ashley Donaldson got a hold of one to give herself her second career home run and the Gauchos the 2-1 lead.† Unfortunately, Utah Tech returned to tie it and take the lead in the 6th. The Trailblazers pushed 3 runs across off a double and a fielding error giving them the 4-2 lead. The deficit was too large for the Gauchos, as they dropped the first game 5-3.† The Gauchos quickly turned around against the Fresno State Bulldogs. Donaldson hit a single up the middle to make it 1-0 Gauchos. Junior pitcher Camryn Snyder allowed 4 hits, 4 strikeouts and 4 walks, earning the win.† UC Santa Barbara scored 3 more runs after Fresno State scored 1 in the 3rd inning, giving the Gauchos a 4-1 win after 7.† The following day, the Gauchos sought revenge against the Trailblazers for the last 2 games of the Bulldog Classic.† For the first game, the Gauchos got on the board first for the third straight time in the classic. Three Gauchos were credited with RBIs in the inning; Freshmen second baseman Jazzy Santos and sophomore center fielder Alexa Sams had 1. Freshman third baseman Bella Fuentes had 2 RBIs after her triple to center.† Utah Tech soon pushed runs across in the third inning, scoring 4-3 in favor of UC Santa Barbara. The Trailblazers soon took the lead after scoring 1 in the 4th and 5th inning. After 6 innings of play, the Gauchos found themselves behind 5-4 heading into the 7th. UC Santa Barbara did not go down without a fight, as they tied it up on a Santos single in the 7th and then took the lead in the 8th by scoring 2 more runs. Senior pitcher Ilona Sullivan earned the win after getting the last 3 outs of the 7-5 ballgame.† Both teams looked to take the last game of the series to fulfill the series win against one another. The Gauchos did not strike first for once as the Trailblazers hit an RBI single and a sacrifice fly to score 2 in the inning, giving them the early 2-0 lead after 2 innings.† Santos continued to stay hot as she hit another RBI single on the day to cut the deficit in the 4th. From there, the game became scoreless until the 7th, and Utah Tech added some insurance as a double bought one to make it 3-1.† Fortunately for the Gauchos, the deficit was not too large for them. UC Santa Barbara came back with 3 runs to walk it off. Sophomore catcher Daryn Siegel got the scoring going, as she hit an RBI single to make 3-2. McNally tied it at 3-3 after an RBI double. Donaldson finished off the Trailblazers with her own RBI double to secure the 4-3 victory.† The Gauchos will kick off their Big West campaign next weekend by traveling to Hawaii for a 3-game series.

Sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell tries to attack the defense as senior forward Miles Norris calls for the ball in the paint. Maddy Fangio/Daily Nexus † The Gauchos came out competing in the first half, taking a one-point lead going into the break. UC Santa Barbara came out swinging the rock and trying to hold the scoring of guards Adam Flager, Keyonte George and LJ Cryer.† Five minutes into the game the Gauchos seemed to have the momentum following an emphatic slam dunk by junior center Evans Kipruto.† Just past the 10-minute mark in the first half, the Bears put up their biggest lead of the half, going up 21-13 following a Flager three-pointer.† The Gauchos responded to the run with a hot stretch of their own. Following back-to-back two-point buckets from sophomore guard Cole Anderson, the Gauchos regained a 26-22 lead.† After an exchange of buckets back and forth, the Gauchos took the lead heading into the break, by a score of 36-33. In a game against the 2021 NCAA champions, the Gauchos were the better team in the first half.† The Gauchos' first-half lead disappeared in a hurry after halftime, with the Bears' defense ramping up the intensity. Following a Cryer three-pointer with 16:39 remaining in the half, the Bears would not give up the lead for the rest of the game. Sophomore guard Ajay Mitchell would draw a foul at the 9:11 mark and split one of two free throws to cut the Bears' lead to seven.† ""úIt's always great playing against a good guard, especially a team like Baylor,""ù said Mitchell. ""úJust happy to have that experience. We saw in the first half we were right there. Second half they picked up the pressure. Now ""î just about us. We came here, focused on ourselves and how we're going to play, and that's how we ended it.""ù Once again, the Bears prevailed, going on a 15-4 run to end the game, with the final score in favor of the Bears, 74-56.† ""úThey started trapping me on ball screens,""ù said Mitchell. ""úWe knew it before the game. So our game plan was to move the ball and find open men. And they did a good job in defense, especially in the second half, we only scored 20.""ù Mitchell finished with 13 points on 5/12 shooting and four assists, while senior forward Miles Norris led UCSB with 15 points and four rebounds in his final game with the Gauchos. The Bears were led by Flagler and Cryer who had 18 and 15 points respectively. ""úI'm really going to miss [playing at UCSB] a lot,""ù said Norris. ""úI love all my teammates. So that's the main thing for me is just the experience doing it with the guys I love.""ù With the loss, the UCSB men's basketball team's season came to an end. However, the season was overall successful as the team broke the program record for most wins in a season.† ""úWhat I told the guys after the game is there's nothing to hang your heads on,""ù said Joe Pasternack, the Gaucho's coach. ""úWe had a great first half. We ran out of steam in the second half. But they're going to be connected, we're all going to be connected for life because they hung two championship banners, a regular season and a conference tournament championship, broke the record all-time wins by four games. Really hard to do in college basketball. And we'll all be connected forever with that record.""ù In the offseason, the Gauchos will look to regroup and find players to fill the roles of outgoing players such as Norris and graduate forward Andre Kelly.† ""úI'm recruiting tonight,""ù said Pasternack after the game.† Ever since Pasternack took over as head coach for the men's basketball team at UCSB, the Gauchos have been one of the top teams in the Big West with two Big West Championships and a 132-53 record.†

The Bulldogs pushed another run across the board to take the 2-1 lead. Sophomore pitcher Matt Ager limited the damage from there by keeping the Bulldogs scoreless from there.† Ager went five and one-third of innings pitched, only allowing 3 hits, 4 walks and 6 strikeouts.

Snyder limited the damage, though, as that was the only run she gave up all game. Snyder held CSU Bakersfield scoreless from there, giving the Gauchos a chance to rebut. The Gauchos came through for their pitcher as late-inning heroics were in full effect. With the Roadrunners only needing 3 more outs in the last inning to seal the game, UCSB pushed 3 runs across.† With 2 outs, junior shortstop Madelyn McNally tied the game up at 1-1 with an RBI single. Then on a wild pitch, senior center fielder Sam Denehy scored to give the Gauchos their first lead. Junior catcher Ashley Donaldson added an insurance run as she hit an RBI single, scoring McNally. Snyder shut the door from there, giving the Gauchos the 3-1 win. The Gauchos wasted no time in game two, as they pushed 2 runs across in the 1st inning to set the tone. Sophomore left fielder Alexa Sams reached on a fielder's choice, scoring McNally. Freshman second baseman Jazzy Santos added on as she singled down the right field line, scoring Donaldson.† The Gauchos added one more to the run column in the top of the 3rd inning as sophomore right fielder Lucy Mogan hit a sacrifice fly. The Roadrunners, in the bottom half of the inning, tied it up quickly as they strung together 3 hits and 2 walks to make it 3-3 after 3 innings of play.† Both sides went back and forth in the 4th inning, as they both scored 2 runs in their respective halves of the inning. The Gauchos scored 2 runs off a Donaldson triple-scoring McNally, and then Sams followed up with a sacrifice fly to score Donaldson.† CSU Bakersfield scored their 2 runs off one swing of the bat as the senior pitcher fell victim to the long ball. After 4 innings, the game remained tied. UCSB broke the tie again as Mogan doubled scoring one. Then freshman third baseman Bella Fuentes reached on an error, causing Mogan to score. Snyder did allow 1 run in the 6th to make it 7-6, but she had no damage from there as she shut the Roadrunners down, giving herself her 10th win on the season and the Gauchos' 21st win on the season.† In game three, the Roadrunners were not looking to get swept as they pushed 3 runs across in the bottom of the 1st inning. From there, it was all Gauchos as they scored 10 unanswered runs.† The Gauchos tied it in the top of the 3rd inning with a couple of RBI singles. Donaldson, Sams and senior first baseman Hannah Damore were all credited with RBIs, making it 3-3 after 3 innings. The Gauchos then poured it on in the 5th, as they scored 7 runs to give themselves a 7-run lead. The Gauchos forced 2 errors in the top of the inning, as they also rallied to earn 6 hits and bat around.† The Gauchos completed the sweep with the 10-6 win tying them with the California State University, Long Beach Elbees for first place in the Big West conference.† Next week's matchup looks to be a big one, as the Gauchos return home to host the Elbees. The series will consist of one doubleheader on Saturday, April 15, with the first pitch scheduled at noon. The series' last game will be a single game on Sunday, April 16 at 1 p.m.

sports,UCSB alumni dicing up MLB hitters,11-Apr-23,6:54 PM,['Garret Harcourt'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-11/ucsb-alumni-dicing-up-mlb-hitters/,"UC Santa Barbara has a long-standing tradition of producing talented baseball players, and this is evident in the number of alumni who have made their way into Major League Baseball. Today, there are several UCSB alumni playing in the MLB, a majority of them being major league pitchers. Nexus File Photo † Shane Bieber graduated from UCSB in 2016. Bieber was not heavily recruited out of high school and was not drafted until the fourth round of the 2016 MLB Draft. Bieber quickly proved himself in the minor leagues and made his MLB debut with the Cleveland Indians in 2018. Since then, Bieber has become one of the most dominant pitchers in the league, winning the American League Cy Young Award in 2020. This season Bieber has picked up right where he left off. In three starts on the year he has accumulated a 2.37 earned run average, 0.95 walks and hits per inning, and 1 win.† Another former Gaucho in the MLB is Kyle Nelson. Nelson graduated in 2018 and was drafted by the Indians in the 15th round of the 2017 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut in 2020 and has bounced around a couple MLB teams since. This season Nelson has appeared in 4 games for the Arizona Diamondbacks, picking up 1 win with a 2.25 earned run average. One of the more notable names coming out of UCSB is pitcher Dillon Tate. Selected No. 4 overall in the first round of the MLB draft, Tate is the highest drafted alumni to come out of UCSB.† Tate is coming off the best season of his career posting 4 wins, 8 saves, and a 3.05 earned run average. The Baltimore Orioles are hoping for a speedy recovery for Tate who has started the season on the injured list. Andrew Vasquez was one of the best left-handed pitchers to come out of UCSB. During his time as a Gaucho, he tallied a 1.93 earned run average to lead the Big West. This led to his eventual drafting in 2015 by the Minnesota Twins.† After going to a variety of MLB teams, Vasquez has settled on the Philadelphia Phillies. This season has been the best to start for the lefty, having a 1.23 earned run average in 7.1 innings pitched. Some notable names in the farm system for MLB teams include pitchers Noah Davis, Rodney Boone, and Michael McGreevy. Of the bunch, Davis is the most likely to make it to the MLB this season, as he appeared in one game for the Colorado Rockies last season. McGreevy is a highly touted prospect in the St. Louis Cardinals who was drafted in the first round of the 2021 MLB draft. These are just a few examples of the many UCSB alumni currently making an impact in the MLB. Despite coming from a mid-major conference, these Gauchos have proven that they can compete with the best of the best on the baseball field. As the MLB continues to evolve, it's clear that UCSB alumni will continue to be a driving force in the sport. This season, the Gaucho's pitchers in the MLB look to continue to make their mark in the game.

sports,Gauchos Sweep UCSD on the Road,30-Apr-23,9:53 PM,['Isaiah Ochoa'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-04-30/110975/,"The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos traveled to San Diego as they took on the UC San Diego Tritons for the Big West Conference series. The Gauchos dominated the weekend, sweeping the Tritons 4-2, 10-3 and 11-5.†  In the opening game of the series, the Tritons tried to catch the Gauchos off guard as they started an opener against them. UCSB, staying alert at all times, submitted a line-up card with freshman pitcher Frank Camarillo playing second base and junior pitcher JD Callahan playing center field. Both Camarillo and Callahan were pinch-hit for as freshman outfielder Josh Williams and sophomore outfielder Justin Trimble replaced them for the ideal matchup against the Tritons.† Through 5 innings, the game remained scoreless as sophomore pitcher Matt Ager continued his dominant sophomore campaign. Ager pitched 6 innings, limiting the Tritons to 3 hits and 6 strikeouts.† In the top of the 6th inning, the Gauchos broke the scoreless tie as senior outfielder Christian Kirtley made himself a productive out. The senior grounded out to shortstop bringing in sophomore third baseman Zander Darby to make it 1-0 UCSB. The Gauchos extended their lead in the top of the 7th. Sophomore catcher Aaron Parker led off the 7th inning with a single. Parker scored on a wild pitch after being moved to third on a single from sophomore first baseman LeTrey McCollum. Working with a 2-0 lead, Ager tried to work into the 7tn inning but was pulled after a leadoff walk. Junior pitcher Carter Benbrook was called upon to inherit Ager's runner and end the inning with no damage.† Head Coach Andrew Checketts' plan didn't go how he wanted as a fielding error scored 2 runs, one earned and one unearned. The run was given to Ager as the leadoff walk proved to be costly. Benbrook limited the damage from there as he ended the 7th inning in a 2-2 tie.† From there, the game remained tied until the top of the 9th inning. Junior second baseman Jonah Sebring got the Gauchos going as he hit a leadoff double, where he soon found himself on third after a dropped third strike. Moments later, Sebring brought the crowd to their feet as he stole home on a pickoff attempt to first base.† The Gauchos added one more in the top half to make it 4-2. Freshman pitcher Tyler Bremner sealed the win for the Gauchos as he struck the last batter out looking. For game two, the offense came alive for the Gauchos. Senior outfielder Broc Mortensen doubled in 2 runs, making it 2-0. In the inning, McCollum earned an RBI walk, and freshman shortstop Corey Nunez also singled in two to make it 5-0.† In the next half of the inning, the Gauchos tried a new strategy: moving freshman pitcher Hudson Barrett from the bullpen to Saturday starter. Barrett showed no nerves in his first collegiate start, as in 5 innings, he only gave up 3 hits and 8 strikeouts.† UCSB added more to their total as Sebring, Nunez and junior catcher John Newman, Jr., homered in separate innings to make it 9-0. Junior pitcher Nick Welch and sophomore pitcher Michael Rice both came in relief to give the Gauchos the 10-3 win. As UCSB looked to get the sweep on the weekend, the offense picked up from where they left off. To begin the game, Mortensen hit a 2-run home run to make it 2-0 Gauchos quickly.† Callahan took the mound for the Gauchos as he kept the Tritons scoreless for 2 innings while striking out 4. UCSB gave their pitcher breathing room as they scored 4 runs in the top of the 3rd. Parker earned 2 RBIs after a 2-run homer, while Nunez and junior outfielder Jared Sundstrom singled in 1 run to make it 6-0.† Callahan was in trouble in the bottom 3rd as the Tritons had already scored 2 runs and threatened to score more. Callahan remained calm as he struck out the last batter to end the inning and eliminate further damage.† From there, the Gauchos continued to dominate as they scored 5 more runs and sealed the 11-5 win with Benbrook coming in from the bullpen. With this sweep, the Gauchos made a massive jump in the Big West Conference standings, as they went from fifth to second. Next weekend, from April 28-30, UCSB will host the UC Davis Aggies at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium for a three-game series, marking their return to their home field.

Nexus File Photo In their first game, the CSU Fullerton Titans were able to capitalize on the Gauchos' miscues on the field and on the mound. In the 4th inning of the game, the Titans came out hot in the bottom half of the inning, scoring 3 runs via a solo home run and an RBI double.† Sophomore outfielder Alexa Sams broke the shutout for UCSB in the 6th inning, doubling in a run to make it a 3-1† game. The Titans would blow the game open behind 2 errors in the 6th inning to make it a 7-1 ballgame and final score.† In the first game of the double header against the Titans, the Gauchos struggled to capitalize on an early opportunity to score, leaving 3 runners stranded in the top of the 1st inning.† The Titans then took the lead with an RBI double in the first 1st inning and extended their lead with another double in the 3rd. The Gauchos had a chance to score in the 4th inning but ultimately came up empty, while the Titans exploded for 9 runs in the bottom of the inning, leading to an 11-0 advantage. In the 5th inning, UCSB managed to avoid a shutout with a late double from junior catcher Ashley Donaldson, bringing in junior infielder Madelyn McNally, but it wasn't enough as the game ended with a final score of 11-1 in favor of the Titans. Looking to bounce back, the Gauchos needed to pull out a victory to avoid the sweep and drop in the conference standings against the Titans. In the second game of the doubleheader against CSU Fullerton, the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos once again struggled to convert early opportunities, leaving 4 runners on base in the first 2 innings. The Titans took a lead in the 2nd inning, scoring 2 runs on 3 hits. The Gauchos continued to struggle offensively, leaving another runner stranded in the 3rd inning. There were 2 errors by the Gauchos in the 3rd inning, which allowed the Titans to extend their lead to 4-0. Despite a strong pitching performance from junior pitcher Camryn Snyder, who allowed 5 runs (3 earned) and struck out 5, the Gauchos were unable to produce any timely hits and fell to the Titans 5-0, concluding the series. With the Titans sweeping the Gauchos, it puts the Gauchos in a tough position to take the regular season conference crown. The Gauchos will face UC Davis, UC Riverside and California State University, Northridge to end the regular season.† UC Davis sits just above the Gauchos in conference standings as the No. 4 seed, while CSU Northridge holds the same record in conference play. The Gauchos will need to capitalize against UC Riverside, as they sit just above last place in the Big West at 4-14. Look for the softball team to make a huge push at the end of the season to secure a better seed in the end of the season conference tournament.

After wrapping up the sweep, the rest of the matches remained unfinished with the Gauchos leading all but one of the unfinished matches. With this result, the Gauchos were crowned tri-champions and earned the No. 1 overall seed in the Big West Championship. As for the women's team, they narrowly took the loss to Cal Poly's women's tennis squad.† The No. 12 ranked duo partners in the country, sophomore Amelia Honer and senior Kira Reuter, didn't skip a beat, taking down the sisters, sophomore Peyton Dunkle and junior Delanie Dunkle, 6-2.† Freshman Solaya Han and freshman Valentina Khrebtova kept the momentum going, taking the doubles match on court three, after the Gauchos dropped the match on court two. No. 60 ranked Honer easily took her singles match, winning in straight sets, 7-5 and 6-0. On court two junior Camille Kiss took home the victory as well, beating her opponent in consecutive sets, 6-0 and 6-3. The Gauchos would fall to Cal Poly overall though, thanks to the Mustangs taking victories on courts three, four, five and six. With the loss, the women's team will prepare for the Big West Championship, where they are set to take on Long Beach State as the No. 4 seed in the tournament.

UC Santa Barbara won the opening game 6-3 but could not get the bats going in games two and three, as they lost 5-0 and 9-0.† Nexus File Photo Coming into the weekend, both teams tied for first place in the Big West Conference. The high stakes for both teams brought out a large and energetic crowd over the weekend.† On Saturday, April 15 both teams were set to play a doubleheader. In the first game, junior pitcher Camryn Snyder took the circle for the Gauchos, keeping Long Beach scoreless in the 1st inning.† Snyder quickly found herself down one in the 2nd inning as Long Beach hit a solo home run to make it 1-0. Next half of the inning, UCSB took advantage of Long Beach's mistakes as senior infielder Korie Thomas reached on a fielding error, scoring senior infielder Hannah Damore.† The Beach soon broke the tie in the 3rd inning as an RBI single brought the score to 2-1 in favor of Long Beach.† UCSB put up a fight, as they tied and took their first lead in the game in the bottom of the 4th inning. Senior outfielder Sam Denehy tied it up at two after an RBI single. The junior catcher Ashley Donaldson then gave the Gaucho a 2-run lead as she hit her fourth home run of the season, bringing in 2.† After 5 innings of play, the Gauchos remained up 4-2 as Snyder remained in control and didn't give Long Beach any hope of coming back. A sacrifice fly in the top of the 6th inning brought Long Beach only one down. UCSB quickly gave Snyder insurance runs as they scored 2 in the bottom of the 6th to extend their lead to 3.† As Snyder recorded the last 3 outs, she pitched a complete game, striking out 3, earning her eleventh win of the season and giving the Gauchos the first-place spot in the Big West Conference. In game two, the Gauchos struggled. Freshman pitcher Malaya Johnson pitched four and one-third, only allowing 3 runs and striking out 4. Senior pitcher Ilona Sullivan took over from there, going the last 2 innings and striking out 3.† The Gauchos collectively gave up 5 runs and 11 hits through 7 innings. On the other hand, UCSB only had 2 hits coming from junior infielder Madelyn McNally. With little offensive production, UCSB was held scoreless. Coming into the last game of the series, the Gauchos looked to bounce back from game two. UCSB couldn't get the bats going as they were held scoreless again on back-to-back days. A 4-run 1st inning from Long Beach set the tone of the game, as the Gauchos only had 1 hit throughout the game. UCSB dropped to 2nd place in the Big West Conference, tied with UC Davis. The Gauchos travel to Orange County as the Titans are set to host a three-game series against the Gauchos, with the first game taking place on Friday, April 21 at 6 p.m.

sports,Gauchos baseball moves into second place of the Big West after taking the series against UC Riverside.,21-May-23,3:00 PM,['Anthony Gil'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-21/gauchos-baseball-moves-into-second-place-of-the-big-west-after-taking-the-series-against-uc-riverside/,"After coming off a loss to California Baptist and ending their six-game winning streak, the Gauchos were looking to get back on the winning column heading into their three-game series against the UC Riverside Highlanders.  Sophomore right handed pitcher Matt Ager started things off on the mound for the Gauchos to kick off the series. After two back-to-back wild pitches that resulted in runners on first and second, another wild pitch to junior Dominic Martinez, who initially struck out swinging, loaded the bases for the Highlanders. With the bases loaded, junior Anthony Mata singled to third base, bringing home redshirt senior Jacob Shanks in which sophomore Jayden Lopez would add to the lead with a single to right field, bringing Martinez and junior Tyler Weaver across home plate. Mata would eventually be brought home after a single by sophomore Jacob Badawi, ending the first inning on top of the Gauchos with a score of 4-0. The offensive powerhouse of UCSB baseball would quickly fire back the next inning after sophomore Zander Darby hit his sixth home run of the season and freshman Corey Nunez tripling to right field who would quickly be brought home after a single by redshirt junior Jonah Sebring, cutting the deficit to two. Heading into the bottom of the fourth inning, the Gauchos would go on to tie the game 4-4 after a single by Darby and an error by RHP Cruz Barrios resulted in Nunez reaching first who would advance to second after a wild throw put Darby and Nunez in scoring position. Sebring's double into left center field would bring both Darby and Nunez across home plate. The game would ultimately go into extra innings with the score still at four runs a piece. With one out left to go in the bottom of the eleventh inning, the Gauchos chose to intentionally walk Martinez, putting Weaver in scoring position. The Gauchos would quickly find themselves in a jam after a walk to Mata loaded up the bases for the Highlanders. The following at-bat, junior Mason Grace, who pinch hit for Nick Poss, was walked which brought Weaver across home plate to secure game one of the three-game series with a final score of 5-4. After a disappointing end to game one, the Gauchos came into game two with a vengeance with Christian Kirtley hitting a lead-off home run into right center field, jumping out to an early 1-0 lead. With redshirt junior Jared Sundstrom in scoring position after hitting a double to right center field, a single by sophomore Aaron Parker would bring Sundstrom across home plate, heading into the bottom of the first with a 2-0 lead. The Highlanders would quickly answer back after a home run to left center field by junior Anthony McFarland brought home Weaver and Shanks who both previously singled, taking a 3-2 lead over the Gauchos. The Gauchos would respond the following inning after a double to left center field by Nunez brought sophomore LeTrey McCollum home who previously singled to third off a bunt. With Nunez in scoring position, Sundstrom singled through the right side, bringing home Nunez and taking a 4-3 lead over the Highlanders. Despite the Highlanders tying the game at 5-5 in the fourth inning, a four-run performance in the seventh inning by the Gauchos resulted in the series being tied at one game a piece. With the 9-5 win from the previous game under their belt, the Gauchos were looking to take the series against UC Riverside. The Gauchos started the game with Christian Kirtley and Zander Darby strolling over to first base who would both be put into scoring position after Sundstrom grounded out. With both runners in scoring position, Sebring singled to left field, bringing home Kirtley and Darby and jumping out to an early 2-0 lead. The Highlanders would tie the game 2-2 in the second inning after a double to left center field by sophomore Jacob Badawi brought Martinez across home plate who previously doubled down the left field line, and a single by Grace brought home Badawi. The Highlanders would go on to record just two runs the rest of the game as opposed to the Gauchos impressive sixteen runs with half of them coming from the fifth inning. The Gauchos took the series in Riverside with a season high of eighteen runs to the Highlanders four runs scored. The Gauchos look to add to their two-game winning streak this Tuesday as they take on the Loyola Marymount Lions who currently lie in first place of the West Coast Conference.

This Friday, May 5, the Gauchos faced the University of San Diego Toreros in what would be the Gauchos' last game of the season, a 1-4 loss wrapping up their otherwise incredible season.†  Going into the match, UCSB was ranked No. 38 with an overall record of 22-4, and USD was ranked No. 30 with an overall record of 18-7. Although the Toreros had a 4-1 victory over the Gauchos, the match stayed very close from set to set in the singles and doubles matches.† To kick off the match, USD took a lead after freshman Stian Klaassen and freshman Oliver Tarvet overtook freshman Conrad Brown and junior Luka Mrsic in a 6-2 win. USD held their 1-0 lead over UCSB after sophomore Iiro Vasa and junior Sacchitt Sharrma beat junior Kai Brady and junior Phillip Jordan in a close 6-4 win. Heading into the singles matches, the Toreros had a strong lead over the Gauchos.† To start off the singles matches, UCSB's junior Pablo Masjuan defeated Vasa in 2 sets, with the first set going 6-2 and the second set going 6-4. This huge win tied up the match, getting the Gauchos back into the match.† Later on, Tarvet defeated Jordan in 2 sets lasting 6-3 and 6-2, which put the Toreros back on top with a 2-1 lead.† USD built onto their lead when junior Marvin Schaber beat freshman Lucca Liu in a very close 3-set match, with the first 2 sets going to a tiebreaker where each player split and the last set going in Schaber's favor with a 6-3 win. This win gave the Torero's a dominant 3-1 lead over the Gauchos.† To finish up the match, freshman Lambert Ruland defeated Brown in 3 sets, with each set going 4-6, 6-1 and 6-4. This win gave the Toreros a dominant 4-1 victory over the Gauchos, sending them to the second round of the NCAA tournament and ending the Gauchos' unprecedentedly successful season.† Throughout the match, multiple games went unfinished. The unfinished doubles match was called at a score of 5-4 between Ruland and Schaber of USD and sophomore Gianluca Brunkow and Masjuan of UCSB. Additionally, 2 of the singles matches went unfinished. One of those matches was between Sharrma of USD and Mrsic of UCSB. The first 2 sets in this match went 6-2 and 1-6, and the third set was unfinished at 4-4. The second singles match was between Stian Klaassen of USD and freshman Gianluca Brunkow of UCSB. This match lasted 3 sets, with the first going 6-1 and 6-7 and the last set 3-2.† Although the Toreros had a substantial win over the Gauchos, the individual matches remained very close and UCSB put up a strong fight. This loss knocked the Gauchos out of the NCAA tournament, but it was a huge accomplishment to make it to the tournament. After such an outstanding season, the Gauchos future looks very bright.††

The results did not go as planned, as the Gauchos won the opening game but lost the next two.† Nexus File Photo On Friday, May 5, the Gauchos and the Highlanders were set to play a doubleheader. In the first game of the day, both teams found themselves in a pitchers' duel.† Junior pitcher Camryn Snyder took the circle for the Gauchos as she looked to keep the winning streak alive and get her 13th win of the season. Through 3 innings of work, Snyder kept the Highlanders scoreless as the Gauchos struck first in the bottom of the third inning. Junior catcher Ashley Donaldson put UCSB ahead, as she hit a sacrifice fly to score junior outfielder Lauren Lewis.† Pitching with a lead, Snyder kept her foot on the gas, as she continued to keep UCR off the board. The Gauchos pushed one more run on the board as Donaldson earned another RBI off a single in the bottom of the fifth inning.† With a 2-run lead, Snyder pitched a complete game shutout, only allowing 3 hits while striking out 4 to give herself her 13th win.† The Gauchos found themselves behind early in the following game, as the Highlanders scored first. In the top of the second inning, UCR put their own rally together, as 4 hits in the inning resulted in an RBI single to give them the early 1-0 advantage.† Roles flipped from the first game, as the Gauchos struggled to get anything going on the offensive side. UCSB did have a small opportunity to score multiple runs in the bottom of the sixth inning, as they found themselves with bases loaded but with 2 outs. UCSB did not score in the sixth inning, but they finally broke through in the bottom of the seventh as senior infielder Korie Thomas hit an RBI single. However, the Highlanders added 3 more runs to their total before the bottom half of the inning. The Gauchos did not score after the one run, as they split the doubleheader losing 4-1.† In the final game of the series, both teams remained scoreless through 3 innings of work. In the bottom of the fourth, Thomas gave UCSB the early advantage, as she hit an RBI single to make it 1-0 Gauchos.† It did not take long for the Highlanders to respond, as in the top of the fifth, UCR went to the long ball to tie it up at 1-1. The game remained tied, resulting in both teams dueling it out in extra innings. In the top of the eighth inning, UCR broke the tie after UCSB hit a batter with bases loaded, resulting in an RBI hit by pitch.† UCSB limited the damage to one to give themselves to tie it or win it in the bottom half of the inning. The Gauchos continued to battle, as sophomore outfielder Alexa Sams hit an RBI single to tie it up again. The Gauchos had a chance to win it, as Sams was on second base with only 1 out in the bottom half of the inning. UCSB could not take advantage of the situation, as they headed into the top of the ninth inning. UCR blew the game open from there, as an error from UCSB proved to be costly. The Highlanders scored 3 runs to give themselves a 5-2 lead. The Gauchos went down in order in the bottom half of the inning, resulting in a series loss.† The Gauchos will travel to California State University, Northridge next weekend, May ___ for their last conference matchup. A doubleheader is scheduled for Friday, May 12, and a single game on Saturday, May 13.

Freshman right handed pitcher Reed Moring took the mound for the Gauchos who quickly got his teammates off the field after retiring two Lions and redshift senior Sam Biller grounded out. Redshirt senior Christian Kirtley got the ball rolling for the Gauchos with a lead-off single through the right side. What was supposed to be a routine ground out for the Lions resulted in redshirt junior Jared Sundstrom reaching first after an error committed by senior infielder Benny Casillas put Kirtley in scoring position. The Gauchos would jump out to an early 2-0 lead after a double down the left field line by redshirt junior Jonah Sebring brought Kirtley and Sundstrom across home plate. Moring would continue dealing after starting the second inning with two consecutive strikeouts, recording four total strikeouts in just two innings pitched. The Lions would shut out the Gauchos in the bottom of the second inning after sophomore outfielder Ivan Brethowr struck out looking and freshman infielder Corey Nunez grounded into a double play. The following inning, LMU would start to turn things around offensively after sophomore catcher Khadim Diaw doubled down the left field line which brought Casillas and senior infielder Cole Roberts across home plate who both previously singled. Head coach Andrew Checketts made the quick call and had redshirt junior left handed pitcher Carter Benbrook take things over for Moring who finished the day with four strikeouts, allowing three hits and two runs in his two innings pitched. With Casillas and Diaw both in scoring position, senior center Jared Thomas grounded out which resulted in Casillas bringing in the tying run. Despite the Lions tying the game at two runs a piece, it would be short lived after a lead-off home run by Kirtley put the Gauchos back into the lead the very next inning. The score would remain 3-2 until the bottom of the fifth inning where the Gauchos would extend their lead by three. With one out left to go for the Lions after Kirtley and Sundstrom flied out, redshirt senior Broc Mortensen was walked which advanced sophomore infielder Zander Darby to second who previously singled down the middle. Mortensen and Darby would both quickly be put into scoring position after a wild pitch to Sebring advanced both base runners. The Lions would immediately find themselves in a jam after a walk to Sebring loaded the bases for the Gauchos. A stroll around the bases at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium would progress after a walk to Aaron Parker brought Darby across home plate the following at-bat, extending the lead to two. A single through the left side by Brethowr brought home Sebring and Mortensen, finishing the inning with a score of 6-2. LMU started the sixth inning with a double down the right field line by sophomore outfielder Connor Blough who would quickly advance to third after a single by senior infielder Dylan Dennis the following at-bat. With base runners on first and third, sophomore outfielder Devan Ornelas hit a routine grounder and reached first base on a fielder's choice by Nunez which resulted in Dennis being out at second base. Blough would come into score and cut the deficit to three. With the Lions offense starting to heat up, Roberts singled to third base which put Ornelas in scoring position. The following at-bat, Casillas lined out to first base which put the number of outs to two. With the tying run at the plate, Diaw was hit by a pitch which loaded the bases for the Lions. Redshirt junior RHP Alex Schrier got out of the jam the following at-bat after retiring redshirt sophomore Sam Biller. The Lions would continue their late push into the seventh inning after three consecutive walks by Schrier and redshirt junior RHP Sam Whiting, who took over for Schrier after the first walk, loaded up the bases. With an out yet to be recorded by the Gauchos, Dennis grounded into a double play which also resulted in Thomas coming into score to put the score at 4-6. A lead-off home run by Sundstrom the following inning would put the game away for the Gauchos with a final score of 7-4. UCSB continues to hold their second place position in the Big West with an opportunity to take command in the conference as they head to the South Bay for the weekend series against Long Beach State.

Coming out of the break, Miami continued to pour it on, maintaining a double-digit lead for the entire 24 minutes of the second half and at one point leading by 31 points.† Vincent quickly caught fire in the second half, scoring 19 points, shooting 79% from the field and going 6-9 from beyond the arc.† Besides Vincent's memorable performance, the fourth-year forward Duncan Robinson scored 22 points off the bench along with forward Caleb Martin, who scored 18 points to lead Miami to a blow out victory over Boston with a final score of 128-102.† Initially struggling to secure a spot in the playoffs after their loss to the Atlanta Hawks in mid-April, the story behind Miami's historic run this postseason has been centered around veteran forward Jimmy Butler who has been absolutely magnificent in these playoffs, averaging nearly 30 points a game.† Despite recording his lowest numbers of this postseason in Game 3 with 16 points, remarkable performances by Butler's teammates led to the Heat being just one game away from returning to the finals for the second time in three seasons.† Vincent averages 13 points a game this postseason as opposed to 9 in the regular season, and has certainly made a name for himself in the NBA community with his dominating performance in Game 3 to put Miami up 3-0 in the series.† With the odds now in favor of the Heat advancing to the finals, Boston has put themselves in a position that no team in NBA history has ever successfully gotten themselves out of.† Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals will tip-off Tuesday, May 23 at 5:30 p.m. PST in Miami,† where the Heat look to put away the Celtics and prepare for their matchup against the Denver Nuggets. The Nuggets recently swept the Los Angeles Lakers and secured a trip to the finals for the first time in franchise history.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the† May 25, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The Gauchos came home with three gold champions and 12 other athletes reaching the podium.† Nexus File Photo On day one of the meet, redshirt freshman thrower Amanda Spear took the day's best performance. Spear took the podium twice, finishing in second for discus and hammer. Spear almost broke her personal record in the hammer throw but was just shy as the throw went 54.53 meters. Her discus throw was 50.16 meters. Spear's teammates did not walk onto the podium but did place high enough to earn points for the overall team score. Sophomore jumper Emma Barthel placed No. 5, sophomore multi Eitan Goore placed No. 6 in the pole vault and sophomore thrower Jackson Trimble got No. 6 in the discus, while sophomore thrower Jared Freeman placed behind him at No. 7.† The Gauchos also scored in distance running for the 3000-meter steeplechase, as junior runner Sierra Ransweiler placed No. 7, junior runner Madeline Franco placed No. 8 and sophomore runner Zane Golpariani placed No. 4. In day two of the meet for the track events, many Gauchos gave themselves a chance to make it on the podium and help the Gauchos in points to take home the Big West Championship.† Only the top 10 runners in the prelims can move on to qualify for day two of the meet. For the qualifiers, sophomore runner Lauren Lum in the 1500, sophomore hurdler Tyler Holl in the 110 hurdles and 400 hurdles, freshman hurdler Dario Rock in the 110 hurdles, junior sprinter Deonne McCrary and sophomore sprinter Brendan Fong in the 400, sophomore multi Mariana Lanz in the 400 and 400 hurdles, sophomore runner Advait Krishnan and sophomore runner Isabella Abusaid in the 800 and freshman sprinter Finn Andrews in the 400.† †On day two of the meet, junior thrower Malia Benson made† her presence known, as she was the first Gaucho to earn gold. Benson did not need any extra throws, as her first throw was the furthest throw out of everybody. Benson threw the javelin 50.08 meters while her opponent threw it 47.60. Benson was the first to earn gold, but freshman distance runner Ethan Godsey was the first to earn gold for the men. Godsey was crowned, as he placed first in the 5000. Godsey did not push the pace too early, staying in the middle with all the other runners. With the race ending, Godsey made his move on the last 5 laps to put himself first. Godsey inched out the other athlete behind him, winning by 0.81 of a second.† The final Gaucho to take gold was freshman jumper Leon Gillis for the high jump. Gillis' highest jump is marked at 2.14 meters, which equates to 7.25 feet. Gillis was busy with other events, missing his first attempt at 6 feet, 9 inches but came back later to clear it and cleared two more heights to take the gold. At the conclusion of the competition, the men's team placed No. 4, accumulating a total of 90 points, whereas the women's team achieved No. 5 with 85 points. This marked the culmination of the Gauchos' 2023 season, as they eagerly await to determine if any of their athletes will qualify for the postseason.

Graduate pitcher Nico Zeglin was named the Big West Pitcher of the Week after his memorable night for the Dirtbags, recording an impressive 10 strikeouts and allowing just 3 hits. Zeglin pitched all 9 innings for the Dirtbags to which he would surpass the 100 strikeout mark for the year and record his fourth double-digit strikeout performance of the season.† Sophomore pitcher Matt Ager of the Gauchos also had himself a night after nearly topping his season high of 13 strikeouts, finishing the day retiring 10 Dirtbags in his 7 innings pitched and allowing just 4 hits and 1 earned run.† After a poor offensive performance from the night before, the Gauchos completely turned things around in Game 2 as 4 Gaucho players went the distance and managed to shut out the Dirtbags with a final score of 8-0. The Gauchos started the second inning with back-to-back home runs by sophomore outfielder Ivan Brethowr and junior catcher John Newman Jr. Multiple errors committed by the Dirtbags resulted in additional runs for the Gauchos. A fielding error by redshirt junior pitcher Graham Osman resulted in sophomore outfielder LeTrey McCollum reaching first, who eventually crossed home plate along with sophomore infielder Zander Darby after a wild throw by junior first baseman Jonathon Long that also resulted in junior infielder Nick Oakley reaching first. UCSB headed into the bottom of the second inning with a comfortable 4-run lead.† Another home run by Brethowr in the top of the fifth inning brought home sophomore designated hitter Aaron Parker, who had previously walked, extending the lead to 6.† Redshirt junior outfielder Jared Sundstrom and redshirt senior outfielder and catcher Christian Kirtley went on to add to the home run count after Sundstrom homered to left field in the top of the seventh inning and Kirtley launched one into center field in the top of the ninth inning.† Junior pitcher Mike Gutierrez started things off for the Gauchos in Game 2 having pitched 4 innings and finishing the day with 4 strikeouts, allowing just 1 hit.† Freshman pitcher Hudson Barrett managed to put away the Dirtbags the rest of the game by tying his season high of 8 strikeouts and allowing just 2 hits in his 5 innings pitched.† Coming off a dominating performance both offensively and defensively in Game 2, the Gauchos looked to take the series in Game 3 by opening up the first inning with a 2-0 lead.† An RBI single through the left side by freshman infielder Ty Borgogno put the Dirtbags on the board 2-1 in the bottom of the second inning.† The Dirtbags went on to take the lead the very next inning after junior catcher Connor Burns skyrocketed one into left center to bring home Long and sophomore infielder Alex Champagne, finishing the inning with a score of 4-2.† After starting off the following inning with back-to-back singles by Borgogno and sophomore outfielder Kyle Ashworth, a single to right field by junior infielder Nick Marinconz brought Ashworth across home plate to extend the lead to 3 runs.† Burns would put the Dirtbags up by 5 runs in the bottom of the seventh inning after recording his second home run of the day, to which he brought home Long who previously singled up the middle.† The Gauchos went on to score just 1 run the rest of the game after initially starting the game with a 2-0 lead in the first inning. With the series loss to CSU Long Beach, UCSB has fallen into third place of the Big West behind UC San Diego. They look to reclaim their second place position this Tuesday, as they head back to Santa Barbara for the one-game series against California Baptist University.

sports,UCSB wins series but drops final game against Cal Poly,23-May-23,7:51 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-05-23/ucsb-wins-series-but-drops-final-game-against-cal-poly/,"After winning the first two games of a three-game series 7-0 and 4-2, the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos baseball team was not able to complete the sweep as they fell to the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Mustangs by a score of 9-5. The Gauchos now have a Big West Conference record of 18-9 and sit in a two-way tie for second place in the conference with Cal State Fullerton. Both teams are chasing UC San Diego, and the Gauchos will need to sweep the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa Rainbow Warriors to tie the Tritons for first place.†  In the first game of the series, sophomore pitcher Matt Ager had a stellar performance as he pitched 7 scoreless innings while striking out 8 batters. Ager only allowed 5 hits and gave up 2 walks in his victory. With Ager firing on all cylinders and Gaucho fielders like redshirt senior Broc Mortensen providing solid defense, UCSB needed minimal offense to win but scored nonetheless. Junior infielder Nick Oakley had 4 RBIs and obtained them by hitting a 1-run home run and a double that scored 3. Sophomore outfielder Ivan Brethowr had 2 RBIs of his own and the Gauchos were able to complete the 7-0 shutout. In the second game of the series, the UCSB offense made some noise as sophomore infielder Zander Darby hit a 1-run home run in the Gaucho's second at-bat in the game. In the next inning, an error from Cal Poly and an RBI from freshman infielder Corey Nunez gave the Gauchos 2 more runs and increased the lead to 3-0. Junior pitcher Mike Gutierrez had a solid outing for UCSB as he started the game and allowed 1 run over 3 innings. In the fourth inning, Mortensen hit his 42nd home run and tied the record for most home runs hit as a UCSB player. The Mustangs were able to add 2 runs to make the score 4-2 but freshman pitcher Hudson Barrett obtained his sixth save of the season as he pitched 1.1 scoreless innings to give the Gauchos the win. In the final game of the series, the Gauchos were not able to repeat the result of the previous 2 games as they fell to Cal Poly. This time around, it was the Mustangs who scored first as they put 2 runs on the board in the second inning. In the next inning, UCSB was able to tie up the game thanks to a 2 RBI single from Darby that scored Oakley and sophomore outfielder LeTrey McCollum. However, things quickly fell apart for the Gauchos as they gave up four more runs as the score changed to 6-2. The Gauchos were able to score 3 more runs, but they could not stop the Mustangs' offense as Cal Poly added 3 more runs. In the end, the Gauchos lost the final game 9-5.† With the 2-1 series win, the Gauchos now have an opportunity to be in a first-place tie in the Big West Conference. To do so, the Gauchos will need to sweep the Rainbow Warriors and gain their 21st conference win of the year. The series will be in Hawai'i, where the Gauchos will play on three consecutive days starting on May 25. The series will be available to stream on ESPN+.† A version of this article appeared on p. 7 of the† May 25, 2023 print edition of the Daily Nexus.

Later in the third, the Gauchos brought in a run due to hits by junior infielder Madelyn McNally, senior outfielder Sam Denehy and junior catcher Ashley Donaldson, which cut the lead in half.† Throughout the next 5 innings, junior pitcher Camryn Snyder did not allow another run and kept the Gauchos within the game.† In the top of the fourth inning, a triple from freshman outfielder Makalya Newsom brought in another run for the Gauchos to tie the game.† In the next few innings, UCSB couldn't find success offensively, giving CSUN the chance to win it in the bottom of the seventh. With a couple of hits in the seventh inning a single by CSUN drove in the winning run where the Matadors outlasted the Gauchos 3-2.† In the second game of the series, the Gauchos started off with a 1-0 lead after hits from McNally and senior outfielder Denehy brought in a run.† Freshman pitcher Malaya Johnson got out of some trouble in the first 2 innings and gave up no runs to CSUN to maintain the Gauchos' lead. The lead quickly disappeared as CSUN scored big in the third.† In the bottom of the third, CSUN brought in 5 runs while the Gauchos committed 1 error, giving the Matadors a commanding 5-1 lead. In addition Johnson gave up 4 hits, which allowed for the Matadors to gain a strong lead.† Later on in the fifth, the Matadors took a 8-1 lead after scoring another 3 runs. Additionally, the Matadors did not give up another run, holding onto their lead. CSUN took back to back games, winning this one 8-1.† In the last game of the series, UCSB once again was outperformed and struggled to find any success at pitching.† In the top of the first, McNally led it off with a single to be followed up with a triple from Denehy. McNally scored on the triple to make it 1-0 Gauchos. Then Donaldson's deep fly ball allowed Deheny to score, giving UCSB a 2-0 advantage over the Matadors. Later in the inning, CSUN brought in a run to cut the lead in half.† The Gauchos got on base in the second inning with a sacrifice bunt from senior infielder Hannah Damore moving freshmen second baseman Jazzy Santos into scoring position.

UCSB Baseball Social Media photo and graphic creds The Bakersfield native quickly found himself called upon early in the season as he pitched in the opening game of the season against the University of Minnesota Gophers, going 1 Öì inning pitched with 1 strikeout earning his first collegiate save.† Following that game, Barrett became the primary pitcher for any save situation. The freshmen pitcher was undoubtedly dominant in 40 innings of work out of the bullpen, and he only allowed 3 runs. Barrett posted a 0.68 earned run average (ERA) when coming in for relief.† Coaches soon moved Barrett to a starting pitching role as injuries struck the Gauchos in the middle of the season. The switch proved to be no problem as Barrett worked 5 innings, allowing no runs and 3 hits, while striking out 8. Barrett wasted no time, as he earned his first collegiate win in his first start.† With the role switch for Barrett, it brought a new change in his athletic career.†† ""úYeah, starters have a set routine every week, and I am a guy that likes a routine, so that transition was nice. Mentally, I still took it as coming out of the pen saving 1 inning at a time rather than ""òhow long can I last' type of mentality,""ù he said.† Barrett's mentality paid off, as he earned a 2-1 record as a starter and finished with a 1.92 ERA, leading all qualified freshmen.† Barrett worked closely with head coach Andrew Checketts and pitching coach Dylan Jones before and throughout the season to continue and maintain his success. ""úI mean, they are great at what they do. They have a set plan for each pitcher and put us to work immediately, so this year, in the fall and winter, working on some things really helped me stand out this season and contribute to team success,""ù Barrett said. The work paid off as Barrett earned multiple awards ranging from All-American to an invite for the USA Baseball Collegiate National team tryout. Barrett earned Perfect Game and Rawlings Freshman All-America First Team, Third Team All-America selection, The Big West Freshman Pitcher of the Year, All-Conference First Team selection, All-West Region honors, invite to USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team camp, National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association† Freshman All-America First Team and Collegiate Baseball Freshman All-American Team.† Looking towards next season, Barrett's accomplishments and goals will be second, as team success will be his first priority. †""ú[It]Starts in the weight room, getting bigger, faster, stronger each day and perfecting my craft on the mound. Team success is what matters, so this next year, I will do what it takes to get to that next gear later in the season,""ù he said.

sports,UCSB baseball players Jared Sundstrom and Sam Whiting taken in 2023 MLB Draft,20-Jul-23,10:06 AM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2023-07-20/ucsb-baseball-players-jared-sundstrom-and-sam-whiting-taken-in-2023-mlb-draft/,"After successful seasons from outfielder Jared Sundstrom and pitcher Sam Whiting for the UC Santa Barbara baseball team, the players were rewarded for their efforts as they were drafted 307th by the Seattle Mariners and 491st overall by the San Diego Padres in the 2023 MLB draft, respectively. However, where the two players will be playing next year is still up in the air, as Sundstrom has another year of eligibility that he may use to play at another university while Whiting has the option to return to UCSB. MLB players stand for the U.S. National Anthem before a game. Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Sundstrom had a productive year for the Gauchos, as he led the Big West Conference in home runs with 15 while making the All-Big West First Team. Additionally, Sundstrom had 43 RBIs and 11 stolen bases. Because of these impressive statistics, Sundstrom was the first Gaucho taken off the board this year.† The next day, Whiting joined Sundstrom as an MLB-drafted player. This season, Whiting had the second most appearances for pitchers on the team with 24. The pitcher had a record of 4-0 with 36 strikeouts and an ERA of 4.44. His game improved against conference opponents as his ERA decreased to 2.84 against Big West opponents.† Sundstrom and Whiting are the 57th and 58th players drafted out of UCSB since Andrew Checketts took over as head coach in 2011. Since the coaching change, the Gauchos have built up a strong program where players consistently get drafted to the pros. Hopefully young skilled players around the country will continue to hold UCSB in high regard in baseball and take their talents to Isla Vista.  I just got paid $7268 to work on my laptop this month.

The game was the beginning of the UCSB Soccer Hispanic Heritage Celebration, a celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month which began on Sept. 15. With the loss to their conference rival, the Gauchos are now 0-1 in the Big West Conference after a 2-2-4 start to begin the season. Cal Poly improved to 2-3-2 with the victory over the Gauchos. After a scoreless first half, UCSB fell apart defensively as they gave up 3 second-half goals. A UCSB player takes a shot at the goal. NEXUS FILE PHOTO The first half was the Gauchos' most successful of the night but they were unable to capitalize and score any goals. The Gauchos had possession for the majority of the half and outshot the Mustangs 4-2. The strongest chances were 2 shots from senior midfielder Lauren Helwig and one from freshman forward Stella Etcheverry. However, the Mustang goalkeeper only needed to make one save in the half, just as UCSB senior goalkeeper Taylor Little did.† After halftime, the Mustangs quickly took over the game. Just before minute 54, Cal Poly went up 1-0 due to a successful passing attack that led to an easy goal. After this goal, momentum completely swung in the Mustangs' favor as UCSB gave up two more goals in the next 20 minutes. However, as the game got out of hand for UCSB, the team continued to fight.† Right before minute 80, freshman forward Olivia Howard found the back of the net after a saved shot from Helwig led to an open rebound. This was the only offense of the night for the Gauchos, as they were unable to score another goal in the final 10 minutes and lost by a score of 3-1.

NEXUS FILE PHOTO After catching heat going into the playoffs with back-to-back wins against the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Mustangs and the California State University, Sacramento Hornets, the Gauchos fell short in their last game of the season. After the conference game loss, the Gauchos fell to 4-3-2 in conference and their overall record dropped to 9-7-2.† Right from the jump, the Titans immediately took control of the match. They held possession of the ball for the majority of the first 10 minutes and controlled the game. But, the Gauchos turned it around in the 15th minute, when senior midfielder Nemo Philipp drove a free kick from 30 yards out towards the goal, but it deflected off a California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) defender.† After the deflected free kick, UCSB continued to show offensive dominance and had another chance in the 23rd minute. Freshman forward Kavi Krishnan's pass to junior midfielder Lucas Gonzalez was too strong, and the CSUF goalkeeper got to it before Gonzalez could take the shot. In the 31st minute, the Gauchos applied more pressure on the Titans on a corner kick that was headed by junior midfielder Mikkel Goeling, but the CSUF goalkeeper saved it once again.† Later on in the half, as the Gauchos were gaining momentum, the Titans retaliated and scored their first goal, taking the lead. For the remainder of the half, the Gauchos dominated possession but did not take any quality shots. The Titans led 1-0 going into the half.† The start of the second half picked up on where the first half ended, where the Gauchos once again dominated possession of the ball. After multiple missed opportunities for the Gauchos to tie up the game, the Titans were awarded a penalty kick and capitalized, extending their lead to 2-0.† In the 63rd minute, the Gauchos had another chance to score when the Titan goalkeeper cleared the ball to Philipp, yet his shot was saved. Later on, in the 74th minute, UCSB hit a cross into the penalty box for a chance of an easy shot, but it was slapped away by CSUF goalkeeper. Right after, sophomore midfielder Filip Basili attempted a deep shot, but it sailed over the goal post. For the remainder of the match, the Gauchos dominated offensively, but the Titans played better defense, not allowing a goal to be scored.† CSUF came out on top with a 2-0 win over the Gauchos to end their regular season. The Gauchos' record was good enough to give them the No. 3 seed for the Big West Conference tournament.† Next week, the Gauchos will host UC Riverside in the first round of the tournament.

The Gauchos took down the Roadrunners in a clean three-set sweep, even after losing opposite Tasia Farmer to an ankle sprain early in the first set. NEXUS FILE PHOTO The Gauchos took an early lead over the Roadrunners in the first set after junior setter Michelle Zhao and senior Briana McKnight spearheaded the team's offensive effort. Bakersfield fought their way back, tying the bout at 21-21. Their effort, however, would be insufficient against the Gauchos as they closed out the set winning 25-23.† The Roadrunners were determined to make their presence known early in the second set, taking an early 8-3 lead after an impressive rally. UCSB's Michelle Ohwobete, Grace Wuischpard and Sophie Reavis had other plans though, helping the Gauchos to regain the lead with a combined 9 kills and impressive work from the service line. The Gauchos finished out the set with a final score of 25-20. With the momentum clearly on their side, the Gauchos steamrolled their way through the third set. With solid work from Grace McIntosh and efficient hitting from the Gauchos' offense, the Roadrunners collapsed. McKnight would seal the Roadrunners' coffin as UCSB took the win 25-14. The Gauchos packed the box score in the win with impressive stats from the whole team. When the final whistle was blown, UCSB led the match in kills (46), blocks (9), assists (39) and digs (45), only surrendering the ace category to the Roadrunners. On the offensive side, the Gauchos' effort was led by McKnight and Michelle Ohwobete, who posted 13 and 12 kills respectively. Reavis also added to the kill total, racking up 10 on the outside with impressive efficiency. UCSB's playmaking was on full display with stellar passing and sets by Zhao who posted 17 assists on the night, followed closely by McIntosh with 16. Ohwobete added to her kills with an ace and solid serving, as well as four blocks. On the defensive, the team was led by senior libero Macall Peed whose 11 digs thwarted the Roadrunners' offense. In the front row, Wuischpard led the Gauchos with 5 blocks.

NEXUS FILE PHOTO On Oct. 27, the Gauchos faced off against the Anteaters for the second time in the season, resulting in a disappointing loss for the Gauchos. In their first matchup, UCSB crushed UCI in 3 blow-out sets but, during their second match, Irvine looked like a completely different team, stepping up and putting pressure on the nationally ranked Gauchos.† Despite UCSB taking an early lead in the first set, UCI battled back and scored when it mattered most. With the help of a late 5-straight service run and a faltering Gaucho defense, the Anteaters came out on top with a final score of 25-19. Shaking off the rough start, UCSB fought back in the second set with a nail-biting victory of 25-23. The following two sets did not go the way the Gauchos anticipated, uncharacteristically unable to deliver late, dropping both with scores of 26-24 and 25-22. UCI had no quit, out-killing the Gauchos 62-48 with hitting percentages of 0.223 to 0.192.† Returning to the winning they have become accustomed to, the Gauchos did not carry any negative energy into the next day, raking up their 11th sweep of the season against the struggling Titans. Head Coach Matt Jones applauded their next day bounceback after the victory as a ""úclean, resilient win.""ù† UCSB was commanding from the start with a 3-0 run to open the first set, never looking back as they won 25-18. Gaining dominance as the match went on, UCSB began the second set with a 5-0 run thanks to 2 aces by junior setter Grace McIntosh. The Titans attempted to make a comeback to make up for their early set mistakes but couldn't catch the Gauchos, coming up short 25-22. The third set saw the Gauchos' offense at its finest, posting a .333 hitting percentage with 4 service aces, crushing the Titans 25-16. Not once did the Gauchos play from behind, maintaining the lead throughout all three sets.† Several players stood out with successful weekend outings. Senior outside hitter Michelle Ohwobete was a bright spot for the Gauchos, leading her team in kills in both matches ""î a combined 30 kills and 18 digs throughout the weekend. Senior libero Macall Peed also played well, collecting 10 digs against Irvine and following it up the next day with 18 digs and 2 aces at Fullerton. Sophomore middle blocker Grace Wuischpard was especially impressive against the Titans, hitting .385 with 6 kills and 3 blocks. The Gauchos ended the weekend sitting atop the Big West with their 11-1 record in conference play and 21-3 overall. The Gauchos look toward their next match against California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo before flying to Hawaii for their final road game of the season. UCSB beat both teams in their previous conference matchups, looking to keep it going in their second face-offs of the season. UCSB aims to sweep SLO on Oct. 31, with streaming available on ESPN+.

sports,Men's basketball defeats Cal State Bakersfield in OT thriler,21-Jan-24,2:51 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-01-21/mens-basketball-defeats-cal-state-bakersfield-in-ot-thriler/,"The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team was able to dig deep and defeat California State University, Bakersfield in overtime by a score of 66-64 at the Thunderdome after not leading for the majority of their game on Jan. 11. After starting Big West conference play with 3-straight losses, the victory put the Gauchos' Big West record at 2-3. Junior guard Ajay Mitchell and senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis led the team's scoring with 22 and 12 points, respectively. Pierre-Louis dribbles towards the rim. NEXUS FILE PHOTO In the first half, the Gauchos' offense left a lot to be desired. Getting good shots was a struggle for UCSB in the period and when they could get open, they missed. Nowhere was this more evident than in the team's first half 3-point shooting where they went 0-8. Overall, the team shot under 30% in the half. While UCSB struggled, CSUB was able to play their style of basketball. The Roadrunners used stout defense and timely shots to build a lead as high as 10 points.† ""úThe first half we shot 29% ""î the lowest of the year,""ù head coach Joe Pasternack said. ""úWe had a really bad first half and we couldn't buy a bucket. We couldn't make a free throw, but this isn't about offense. This is strictly about every single day, can we get 1% better on defense.""ù At the start of the second half, the Gauchos' shooting struggles continued. Once again, the Roadrunners were able to extend the lead to 10 points. Leading these struggles was junior guard Cole Anderson who started the game 0-5 from behind the arc. However, the Gauchos began to take advantage of their offensive opportunities as Mitchell and the rest of the team began hitting shots. With 4 minutes left, UCSB was able to tie the game. But, CSUB went on a small run to retake the lead. With under a minute left, Anderson began to get hot. The sharpshooter hit 2 shots and gave the Gauchos a lead with a little over a second remaining. After the game, Anderson commented on his hot and cold night. ""úThat's honestly what I've been dealing with my whole life as a shooter,""ù Anderson said. ""úI gotta have the mindset that the next one is going in so I stayed ready and my teammates found me.""ù† But, after the huge 3-point shot by Anderson that gave the Gauchos the lead with almost no time left in the game, the team made a costly mistake. The Roadrunners passed the ball to half-court where Mitchell was defending the offensive player. In an awkward position, Mitchell committed a blocking foul and gave CSUB 2 free throws with 0.4 seconds left. If the player taking the free throws hit both of them, it would effectively give Bakersfield the win. The UCSB student section flocked to the baseline and attempted to distract the shooter with yelling and arm waving. The CSUB player hit the first shot but the Gaucho faithful kept up the noise. Miraculously, the second shot rimmed out. The game was headed to overtime after a crazy turn of events.† ""úI didn't want to take a charge at all,""ù Mitchell said. ""úI kinda was right there and I was like, ""òDamn, I messed up.' But, after that, I had to bounce back. Thank God he missed that second free throw and after that, I thought we were back in it.""ù When overtime began, the Gauchos' strong shooting continued. Anderson hit his third straight 3-point attempt and the rest of the team's ball movement was strong. However, CSUB maintained the pace and had the lead late in the period. On the Gauchos' final possession, the team was down by 1 point; Mitchell had the ball and drove to the rim. At the last second, Mitchell passed the ball to freshman guard Jason Fontenet II who had yet to hit a shot all night. In an unbelievable moment, Fontenet II was fouled on his attempt and made the shot go up by 1. The freshman made his free throw and the Roadrunners missed their half-court heave. The Gauchos escaped with a 2-point overtime victory. ""úJason did not have a good game,""ù Pasternack said. ""úI had to sit him because he wasn't very good and I told him that. The fact he was able to sit on the bench and then be able to respond in that moment was huge for him.""ù The Gauchos will now look to build on their success and string together wins after a slow start to conference play. The team now sits at No. 5 in the Big West conference. A version of this article appeared on p. 10 of the Jan. 18, 2024, print edition of the Daily Nexus.

The Gauchos lost both matches: the first one, they lost in 5 sets, going 2-3, while the other only went 4 sets, going 1-3.† NEXUS FILE PHOTO In the first set of the first match, the Gauchos hit the scoreboard early as they went up 7-3 for the first 10 points. Stanford did not let the lead get out of hand as they fought off the early deficit and took the lead at 12-10. Both teams went back and forth through the set as the match was tied at 18. The Cardinals ran away with it from there and secured the first set at 25-21. Going into the second set, both teams went point for point, but the Gauchos found themselves with a 4-point lead after junior setter Jack Walmer created 4 continuous attack errors, giving the Gauchos an 11-8 lead.† Stanford cut down on the mistakes and tied it up at 18 again. UCSB then went on a 3-point run to regain the lead at 21-19. Stanford proved a formidable opponent as they went on a 7-1 run to steal the second set at 25-22 and went up 2-0 in the match.† The Cardinals looked to take the match in three sets as they went up 3-0 to start the set. UCSB did not go down quickly as they tied it and took the lead at 10-8. From there, the set continued point for point until the Gauchos went on a 9-3 hot streak to earn their first set of the match with 25-20. Junior opposite Geste Bianchi ended the set with an electric service ace.† UCSB looked to continue the momentum from the third set as they scored first in the fourth set. The set was tied at 4, where both teams went back and forth in points until the Gauchos went on a 4-point run. Sophomore outside hitter and opposite Owen Birg was credited for 3 of the 4 points in the run.† Stanford responded with their run, scoring 3 continuous points and almost closing the gap to make it 18-19. UCSB successfully pushed the match into 5 sets, taking the fourth set 25-22. In a winner-take-all set, many runs were made as the Gauchos took a 5-2 lead before Stanford took the lead on 6 unanswered points to make it 8-5. UCSB responded with their run and retook the lead with 5 unanswered points, making it 10-9. The set went point for point until it was all tied up at 14. Stanford took the whole match as they scored the last 2 points to secure the 16-14 set win.† The following day, Stanford did not mess around in the first set as they went up 0-3 to start the set. Looking to bounce back, the Gauchos tied it at 4 points, where they then went point for point through the entire set. Stanford took a 3-point lead late and maintained the lead to secure the first set 25-22. UCSB took control of the second set as they took an early 3-point lead, making it 6-3. The Cardinals cut the Gauchos' margin of a lead, but UCSB maintained a point lead until it was all tied up at 16. It looked bleak for the Gauchos as the Cardinals were 1 point away from securing the set as it was 21-24. However, the Gauchos showed their fight as they scored 5 unanswered points, taking the second set 26-24. Junior outside hitter Sam Collins was credited for 4 of the 5 points in the run.† After Stanford let it escape, they were on a mission in the third set as they went up 10-4. UCSB battled back and cut the 6-point lead to tie it at 20. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the Cardinals took the set as they went on a 5-3 run to win 25-23. In the final set, both teams went point for point throughout the whole set. Stanford outlasted UCSB in the back-and-forth frenzy, taking the fourth set at 25-21 and back-to-back matches against the Gauchos.† The Gauchos are set to return to Robertson Gym on Friday and Saturday, Jan. 19-20, to face the No. 9 Brigham Young University Cougars.

sports,UCSB men's basketball completes comeback against Rainbow Warriors,27-Feb-24,6:46 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-27/ucsb-mens-basketball-completes-comeback-against-rainbow-warriors/,"The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team was able to break their three-game losing streak against the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa Rainbow Warriors on Feb. 17. The Gauchos were down by 9 at the half, but a successful second half allowed the Gauchos to leave the Thunderdome with a 77-71 victory. The team now has a conference record of 7-8, which is good enough for No. 6 in the Big West. NEXUS FILE PHOTO Like most times this season when playing against a Big West opponent, the Gauchos got off to a slow start. The team shot just 33.33% from the field in the first half while shooting 30% from the three-point line. Additionally, there was little offensive aggression, as the team shot just 2 free throws in the entire period. Although UCSB jumped out to a 9-0 lead to start the game, things quickly went downhill. The Rainbow Warriors responded with 10 points of their own and were able to hold on for the rest of the half as the Gauchos entered halftime down by 9. The offense throughout the half was stagnant and shots refused to go into the basket. Players throughout the roster were ill or injured, but the Gauchos did not falter and refused to use this adversity as an excuse. ""úI thought our guys really battled this afternoon. In college basketball, each season is a marathon. We have gone through peaks and valleys. We have had an unbelievably tough year through sickness and injuries, but we are never going to talk about the excuses. This is strictly about life. We told our guys today that you are going to have really, really hard times, but you have to find a way to dig down deep and fight. And fight for each other. I am just so proud that our guys battled back.""ù In the second half, the UCSB offense looked like a totally different team. After scoring just 25 points in the first half, the Gauchos more than doubled their scoring output by putting up 52 second-half points. Via this offense, the team was able to tie the game at 46 with just 12 minutes remaining in the match. On this second-half run to tie the game and retake the lead, the team was led by junior guard Ajay Mitchell and senior guard Josh Pierre-Louis. For the game, Mitchell scored 23 points while dishing out 5 assists. Pierre-Louis scored 16 points for the Gauchos, 13 of which came in the final half. Both players were unstoppable in this time frame and were able to get to the basket at will. Mitchell especially seemed to be in his element as he put the team on his back and scored relentlessly. ""úI'm just trying to win,""ù Mitchell said. ""úAt the end of the game, I know I'm going to have the ball, and I'm going to have to make plays. I'm just worried about what I have to do at the end of the game.""ù Mitchell's dominance and free-throw shooting put the Gauchos over the hump in the final minutes. At one point, the junior guard scored 5 straight points for the Gauchos. The team shot 22 free throws in the second half, hitting on 15 of them. In their next match, UCSB will try to extend their winning streak to 2 games. They will be taking on the UC Irvine Anteaters on the road on Feb. 22. In the first meeting between the teams UCI defeated the Gauchos at the Thunderdome by a score of 76-61. The game will tip-off at 8 p.m. and will be available to stream on ESPN+.

sports,Women's basketball falls in out-ofstate road game versus Hawai'i,27-Feb-24,6:49 PM,['Isaiah Ochoa'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-27/womens-basketball-falls-in-out-ofstate-road-game-versus-hawaii/,"The UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team headed to the Hawai ªian islands to face off against the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa Rainbow Wahine on Saturday, Feb 17. The Gaucho's late push wasn't enough, as the Gauchos lost 68-64. AMY DIXON / DAILY NEXUS The Gauchos started off with an early 8-2 lead. However, Hawai ªi responded with 11 unanswered points to take control at 13-8. The Gauchos did not let the lead get away from them as they mounted a comeback, resulting in a tied score of 13 apiece by the end of the quarter. Senior forward Alexis Whitfield significantly contributed to the Gauchos' offense, as she contributed 8 of their 13 points. A back-and-forth battle marked the second quarter until the Gauchos went on a big offensive run, going 8-0. With the offensive run, the Gauchos took a 26-18 lead with 4 minutes left of the second quarter. Hawai ªi did cut down the lead, but the Gauchos protected the lead as much as they could, as at the end of two quarters, the Gauchos were up 32-27.† The third quarter saw the momentum shift in favor of the Wahine. Hawai ªi went on their second 11-0 run of the game. However, after a couple of made shots from senior guard Anya Choice, the Gauchos found themselves only down by 2 points.† Despite a brief exchange of misses, the Gauchos regained the lead with another layup by Choice. However, Hawai ªi fought back to even the score and eventually claimed a one-point advantage heading into the final quarter with a score of 48-47. In the final quarter, Hawai ªi went on another offensive surge. They built an 11-point cushion, prompting the Gauchos to call a timeout and slow down Hawai ªi's offensive success. A pair of successive 3-pointers by Choice and sophomore guard Jessica Grant narrowed the gap to a two-possession game, followed by a pull-up jumper by freshman forward Zoe Borter, cutting it to three with 3 minutes remaining.† Despite their efforts, the Gauchos couldn't cut the deficit enough to knock down the tying basket or take the lead. Grant's 3-pointer reduced the deficit to 2 points with under 30 seconds left, but 2 free throws after a Gaucho foul extended the Wahine's lead to 4 points. In the dying moments, the Gauchos attempted 2 3-pointers but were unsuccessful in finding the basket. Whitfield had a heck of a game as she recorded her fifth 20+ point 10+ rebound game of the season after scoring 21 points and grabbing 17 rebounds. UCSB will return home and host the UC Irvine Anteaters on Thursday, Feb. 22. Tip-off is set to 7 p.m. at the Thunderdome.

sports,Men's basketball loses big on the road against UCI,29-Feb-24,8:00 AM,['Isaiah Ochoa'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-29/mens-basketball-loses-big-on-the-road-against-uci/,"The UC Santa Barbara men's basketball team went on the road on Feb. 22 to face the top team in the Big West Conference, UC Irvine. After a dominant first half from the Anteaters, their lead was too large of a gap for the Gauchos as UC Irvine took the 81-69 win. GRACE LIN / DAILY NEXUS After beating the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa Feb 17, UCSB looked to get a winning streak going as they lost their previous three matchups, one being UCI at home.† The Gauchos won the tip and struck first as junior guard Cole Anderson hit a 3-pointer to get the Gauchos going early. Both teams went point-for-point, as the score was tied at various points in the half.† In the 11th minute of the half, the Anteaters took the lead and started to build on it. After two unanswered jump shots from UCI, the Anteaters were in the lead 20-17. UCSB looked to cut down the lead, but UCI took advantage of some missed jump shots from the Gauchos as they established a 9-point lead with 6 minutes left. The Anteaters continued their offensive push as their lead grew to as much as 14 points with a score of 41-27.† As the first half was closing out, the Gauchos tried to chip away at the lead, but nothing fell for UCSB as UCI kept taking advantage of their misses, growing the lead to 17 points and heading into the locker room with a score of 46-29. Coming out for the second half, the Gauchos didn't get off to the start they wanted as UCI continued putting on an offensive clinic, extending their lead to 22 points.† As it felt as if all hope was lost for UCSB, freshman guard Jason Fontenet II scored 9 unanswered points for the Gauchos. Senior guard Ajay Mitchell joined in on the fun as he knocked down both free throws and came back down the court after a missed jump shot to make a 3-pointer. After 8 minutes of play, the Gauchos found themselves down 9, scoring 56-47 in favor of the Anteaters. UCI followed Mitchell's 3-pointer with a 3 of their own, taking back their double-digit lead. The Anteaters looked to keep the Gauchos out of the game by maintaining their strong lead. The Gauchos cut the lead down to as much as 6 points as Mitchell hit a 3-pointer to make it 75-69 with 47 seconds left. That's all the Gauchos scored in the game's closing seconds as UCI swept the Gauchos in conference play. Fontenet tied his career high in points by scoring 10 points off 4 from 10 shooting and recording a career-high 4 steals.† With the loss, the Gauchos fell to 8th place in the Big West Conference standings. This is the lowest UCSB has ever been since the 2016-2017 season, where they finished in 9th place.†† The Gauchos are set for a week-long break before they head back to the Thunderdome for what promises to be an electrifying matchup in the Blue-Green rivalry. UC Santa Barbara and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo are slated to go head-to-head on Thursday, Feb. 29, with tip-off at 7 p.m. For those unable to attend in person, the game will be broadcast live on ESPN+.

sports,Women's basketball starts slow in loss to UCI,29-Feb-24,8:00 AM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-02-29/womens-basketball-starts-slow-in-loss-to-uci/,"After traveling out of state and losing to the University of Hawai""òi at MƒÅnoa, the UC Santa Barbara women's basketball team returned to the Thunderdome to take on the UC Irvine Anteaters. After a slow start, the Gauchos were able to start a valiant comeback that could not be completed. The Gauchos lost by a score of 54-46 as their Big West Conference record fell to 10-6. This was the first home loss of the season for the team.† AMY DIXON / DAILY NEXUS The Anteaters dominated the first quarter. The Gauchos found themselves down by 14 before they could score any points. As a team, UCSB scored 5 total points in the entire quarter. Over half of these points came from free throws, as the team shot 3 for 6 from the charity stripe. From the field, the Gauchos hit just 1 of their 6 attempts while missing their only three-point attempt. UCI shot 6/19 from the field in the quarter while hitting 1 of their 4 three-pointers. At the end of the quarter, the Anteaters were up 16-5. In the second quarter, things improved for UCSB. The offense looked much better, as they were able to score 13 points in the period. However, UCI was able to keep up the pace by scoring 12 points of their own. The Gauchos' shooting improved as they hit 5 of their 14 attempts. The team was still unable to make a three-pointer. At the end of the half, the Anteaters got the last laugh as they hit a buzzer-beater to extend the lead to 10. The Gauchos entered the locker room at halftime down 28-18.† The Anteaters were able to extend their lead even further at the start of the second half. The UCI advantage ballooned to 17 points before Head Coach Bonnie Henrickson called a timeout. Even with the much-needed break, the team was unable to get anything going. UCSB could not even muster a small run and entered the final quarter down by 17.† In this final quarter, the Gauchos were finally able to find success. Scrappy defense and fluid offense allowed UCSB to cut the lead down to 8. However, the UCI effort suddenly picked up again and the Gauchos went back to their scoring woes. UCSB would be unable to decrease the lead any further as the Anteaters held on as the final buzzer sounded.† In the match, the Gauchos were led by junior center Flora Goed and senior guard Alyssa Marin. Goed scored 10 points and grabbed 3 rebounds while Marin scored 9 and shot 75% from the free-throw line. Additionally, senior forward Alexis Whitfield scored 7 points, dished out 7 assists and grabbed 12 boards.† The UCI victory over the Gauchos clinched a season sweep for the Anteaters over UCSB. For their next match, UCSB women's basketball will travel to San Luis Obispo to take on the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Mustangs. In the Gauchos' first match against the Mustangs, Henrickson and her team left the Thunderdome with a 65-64 overtime victory.

The game was a back-and-forth affair, but the Bruins got the last laugh as they squeaked by in extra innings via walkoff. In the loss, UCSB was led offensively by junior designated hitter Aaron Parker and his 4 RBIs. After the game, the Gaucho's record is 13-8. NEXUS FILE PHOTO† The Bruins were able to score first after a scoreless first inning for UCSB. With two outs, the Bruins were able to hit a two-run home run to make the score 2-0. However, UCSB got the offense going immediately after they faced a deficit. In the top of the second inning, the Gauchos were able to retake the lead. In the second, the Gaucho bats came alive. After junior catcher Brendan Durfee and junior third baseman Justin Trimble got on base, junior left fielder Jessada Brown blasted a three-run homerun into the stands. With the UCLA pitcher struggling, the Gauchos offense kept up the pace. Shortly after the run, junior right fielder Ivan Brethowr hit an RBI single to extend the UCSB lead to 4-2. After the fourth run in the inning, UCLA replaced their starting pitcher. Unfortunately for the Gauchos, the Bruins were able to score two runs of their own to tie the game in the bottom of the inning. In the top of the third, Trimble was able to retake the lead for his team with a sacrifice ground ball.† In the fourth, the Gauchos were able to extend their lead by one. UCLA was struggling to score due to the success of freshman pitcher Jackson Flora. However, the Gauchos were able to continue their pace as they added two more runs to score their seventh of the game. At the end of the fourth, UCSB was up 7-5. In the fifth inning, the Gaucho defense began showing holes. Flora was pulled from the game as the Bruins were able to score enough runs to tie the score. However, thanks to a great diving defensive play from senior second baseman Nick Oakley, UCLA was not able to take the lead at that moment. After the great catch, Oakley made a phenomenal throw to home plate to get a runner out and end the inning.† The game stayed tied until the bottom of the seventh inning when UCLA hit a two-run homer to take a 10-8 lead late in the game. Neither team scored in the eighth, so the Gauchos had one inning left to take the game into extras. After multiple runners got on base to start the ninth, Parker hit a clutch RBI double to tie the game. In a shocking turn of events, the Gauchos took the lead from an RBI triple courtesy of junior first baseman Zander Darby. With a half-inning remaining, UCSB was up 11-10.† Instead of ending the game, the UCSB defense was responsible for extending it. Late in the frame, the Gauchos closer hit the batter with a pitch while the bases were loaded. With this gaffe, UCLA was able to tie the game once again. The match was headed to extra innings.† Both teams were scoreless in the tenth inning. However, this trend did not last long. Thanks to another RBI from Darby, UCSB took a 12-11 lead in the top of the eleventh inning. UCLA was able to score right after to extend the game even further. The Gauchos had no more offense remaining as they went scoreless in the top of the thirteenth. With the game tied in the bottom of the inning, UCLA scored just one run to walk off the Gauchos. The Bruins celebrated at home plate as they scored their thirteenth and final run. For their next game, UCSB will travel back to Santa Barbara on March 28 to take on San Jose State University. The game will be the first match in a three-game series. The first pitch is scheduled for 4:35 p.m. but weather may force the game to be delayed. Every game of the series will be available to stream on ESPN+.

sports,Men's Basketball Falls to UC Riverside at Home in Final Regular Season Contest,18-Apr-24,2:26 PM,['Aidan Dobbins'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-04-18/mens-basketball-falls-to-uc-riverside-at-home-in-final-regular-season-contest/,"UC Santa Barbara fell to the UC Riverside Highlanders in disappointing fashion Saturday
night, losing to their conference rival 81-64 at the Thunderdome. From the opening minutes of
the first period, it simply did not look like the Gauchos' night, as the team quickly found
themselves in an 18-2 hole after a bevy of turnovers. Fortunately, a corner three-pointer from
junior guard Cole Anderson seemed to stop the bleeding at least temporarily. As UCSB
continued to attempt a comeback, tempers began to flair up, as star Santa Barbara guard Ajay
Mitchell exchanged words and buckets with Riverside's guard Nate Pickens. The rising tensions
may have sparked the seemingly lifeless Santa Barbara offense, with another Anderson corner
three-pointer cutting the deficit to single digits at 29-20 midway through the opening period. GRACE LIN/DAILY NEXUS Unfortunately for the Gauchos, Riverside continued raining down threes en route to a
16-point lead to close the first half. This first-half lead was mostly due to Riverside's hot
shooting, as the visitors poured in nine three-pointers at a 53% clip. Senior guard Josh
Pierre-Louis's acrobatic layup to beat the buzzer was a stunning highlight that not only collected
gasps and whoops from the crowd, but potentially momentum leading into the second period as
well. This shift in momentum proved to be true in the opening minutes of the second half, as
Santa Barbara and Riverside traded back-and-forth baskets. A three-pointer from freshman guard
Jason Fontennet cut the deficit to 12, and the Gauchos appeared back on track to make a surging
comeback. Unfortunately, the Highlander offensive overcast would eventually become torrential
once again, as the Gauchos found themselves in a 26-point crater with eight minutes left in the
game after an array of Riverside jumpshots. Despite an impressive run by Santa Barbara in the
waning minutes, this effort was ultimately too little too late, with Riverside standing triumphant
as the buzzer sounded. Bright spots for Santa Barbara, although few and far between, could be
found in Pierre-Louis and sophomore forward Yohan Traore combining for 33 points on 12 for
19 shooting. The clear difference-maker in the matchup was the three-point attempt disparity, as UC
Riverside nearly took three times as many shots from deep as UC Santa Barbara at 30 to 12,
respectively. This is no surprise, of course, as Riverside stands at the top of the Big West men's
basketball division in total three-point attempts on the season while Santa Barbara is second to
last in the conference in the same statistic. Head coach Joe Pasternik responded to a question of
whether this gap is a matter of offensive philosophy or due to personnel: ""úWe are the most
efficient team in our conference for a reason.,""ù the Gauchos make 49% of their field goals, which
leads the Big West. ""úOur inside scoring is where we excel, we just need to do a better job of
containing other teams' shooters.""ù While the regular season slate may have concluded for UCSB Men's Basketball, the
Gauchos will be heading to Las Vegas to take on Cal-State University Northridge this
Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. PST for the first round of the Big West Men's Basketball Tournament.
Santa Barbara looks to defend their title as Big West Champions.

sports,UCSB baseball sweeps CSUN on the road,28-May-24,9:46 PM,['Preston Espar'],https://dailynexus.com/2024-05-28/ucsb-baseball-sweeps-csun-on-the-road/,"The UC Santa Barbara baseball team continued its dominance over the Big West Conference this past weekend as they swept the California State University, Northridge Matadors. With the sweep, the Gauchos are holding onto an 11-game winning streak. The team has now swept six straight conference opponents and has not lost against a Big West opponent since April 7, when they fell to UC Irvine. With this strong conference play, the squad sits atop the Big West standings.† UCSB Baseball adds to its 11-game win streak after sweeping CSUN. Maddy Fangio / Daily Nexus The first game of the series was not a close contest as the Gauchos controlled the game from the first pitch. UCSB scored quickly as an RBI double from senior infielder Jonah Sebring put his team up 1-0. In the next inning, junior catcher Aaron Parker doubled the lead with a sacrifice lineout. Two innings later, junior outfielder Ivan Brethowr hit a two-run home run to extend the lead to four. Sebring continued his solid day with a solo home run of his own to make the score 5-0.† In the seventh inning, the Gauchos put the game away as they put eight runs on the scoreboard. In the inning, the team hit two home runs as junior outfielder Jessada Brown hit a three-run homer and Brethowr hit his second of the day.† On the opposite side of the ball, the UCSB pitching and defense played a stellar game. Sophomore starting pitcher Ryan Gallagher continued his successful season with another strong outing. Gallagher retired the first 16 batters he faced out before allowing a Matador on base. Gallagher left the game, only allowing one run as he picked up his eighth win of the season. The final score of 14-2 set the tone for the rest of the series. The second match of the weekend was much closer, but UCSB was victorious in the end. The Matadors were even able to take a 2-0 lead before the Gauchos took over. UCSB finally made it on the board in the fifth inning thanks to a sacrifice fly from Brown. The team was finally able to tie the game in the eighth inning. With the bases loaded, freshman infielder Jonathan Mendez got an RBI by forcing the pitcher to walk him.† In the final inning, the Gauchos took their first lead of the game. With the game on the line, senior infielder Nick Oakley hit a two-run homer to take a 4-2 lead. The defense held on and UCSB was able to clinch their second win of the series.† In the final game of the season, the Gauchos were able to secure the sweep after a miraculous comeback. This time, California State University, Northridge (CSUN) scored four unanswered runs to begin the game. However, just like the day prior, UCSB stormed back. In the fourth inning, Parker hit a solo home run to get the first run for his team. In the next inning, Brown hit an RBI to send Brethowr home and cut the lead to two. The Gauchos made it three consecutive innings with a run when Sebring scored via a wild pitch in the sixth inning. In the eighth inning, the Gauchos scored their final runs of the game, and it was enough to secure the win. Brown got an RBI walk in the inning while junior infielder Justin Trimble and junior infielder Zander Darby got RBI hits to make the score 6-3. This was the final score, as CSUN was unable to score again.† Next, the Gauchos will travel back to Santa Barbara to finish up their season. They will play one more three-game series, this time against UC Riverside. The three games will be part of Senior Weekend for the program as they celebrate their graduating players. The games will be played from May 23-25, and each game will be available to stream on ESPN+.

Two of these wins came from big conference games against California State University, Northridge Matadors this past weekend.† The Gauchos finish their season with a 20-28 overall record and a 14-13 conference record. Nina Timofeyeva / Daily Nexus In UCSB's first game against California State University, Northridge (CSUN) they were slightly outmatched, resulting in a 3-4 loss.† The Gauchos were down 1-0 in the fourth inning when they managed to get on the scoreboard. UCSB scored two runs in that inning, highlighted by an RBI triple from senior outfielder Alana Snow. The Matadors later tied the game at 2-2 before the Gauchos regained their lead in the sixth inning. Santa Barbara added a run with an RBI single from Snow, making the score 3-2 in their favor.† However, the Gauchos couldn't maintain their lead, as CSUN scored twice in the top of the seventh, ultimately leading them to victory. Senior pitcher Camryn Snyder started on the mound for the Gauchos, pitching seven innings, allowing four runs (three earned) on eight hits, and striking out three.† Offensively, the Gauchos were led by Snow, who went 2-for-4 with a triple and two RBIs.† In the Gauchos' second game, they bounced back and secured a 4-3 win over the Matadors. The Gauchos wasted no time getting on the scoreboard, putting up three runs in the bottom of the first inning, all with two outs. Junior outfielder Alexa Sams got things started with a two-RBI single, followed by an RBI single from junior utility Elicia Acosta, giving the Gauchos an early 3-0 lead.† CSUN responded in the fourth inning, tying the game at 3-3 with a two-out RBI double. Both teams were then held scoreless for the next two innings. In the bottom of the seventh, after retiring the Matadors in order, UCSB secured the win with a walk-off RBI single from sophomore outfielder Jazzy Santos. Sophomore pitcher Malaya Johnson started in the circle for the Gauchos and earned the win. The right-hander pitched seven innings, allowing three runs on six hits while striking out three. To end out the series, the Gauchos collected another win dominating the Matadors 12-8.† The Gauchos, initially down 1-0, scored three runs in the first inning with Santos driving in two runs with a double. After the Matadors tied it at 3-3, the Gauchos took a 9-3 lead in the third inning, highlighted by an RBI single from senior infielder Madelyn McNally.† CSUN closed the gap to 9-8, but UCSB extended its lead to 10-8 in the fifth with a leadoff home run by Acosta. In the next inning, the Gauchos added two more runs with an RBI triple from Sams, securing a 12-8 win.† Johnson earned the win, pitching 3.2 scoreless innings with five hits and two strikeouts.
